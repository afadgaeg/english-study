If unobserved, it will.

If it's observed after it left the plane,

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,264
- ...it will not have gone through both slits.
- Agreed.

<font color="#808080">LEONAND</font>: What's your point?

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,685
There's no point,
I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt.

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,860
- Excuse me.
- Hang on.

00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,283
One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov.

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,952
Twenty-six across is MCM.

that's Port-Au-Prince.

15
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,177
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

16
00:00:55,513 --> 00:01:00,184
Um, is this the high-IQ sperm bank?

17
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,021
If you have to ask,
maybe you shouldn't be here.

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,191
I think this is the place.

19
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,359
- Fill these out.
- Thank you.

20
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,695
- We'll be right back.
- Oh, take your time.

21
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,531
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,367
Oh, wait.

23
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,713
Leonard, I don't think I can do this.

24
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,508
What, are you kidding? You're a semipro.

25
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,469
No. We are committing genetic fraud.

26
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,847
There's no guarantee our sperm's
going to generate high-IQ offspring.

27
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,015
Think about that.

28
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:44,520
I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix
who hostesses at Fuddruckers.

29
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,814
Sheldon, this was your idea.

30
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,192
A little extra money to get
fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment?

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,695
I know.
And I do yearn for faster downloads.

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,199
There's some poor woman
who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

33
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,369
What if she winds up with a toddler
who doesn't know if he should use...

34
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,039
...a differential to solve for the area
under a curve?

35
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,793
- I'm sure she'll still love him.
- I wouldn't.

36
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,004
Well, what do you wanna do?

37
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,590
- I want to leave.
- Okay.

38
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,968
- What's the protocol for leaving?
- I don't know.

39
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,263
I've never reneged
on a proffer of sperm before.

40
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,640
Let's try just walking out.

41
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,725
Okay.

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,862
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

43
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,446
Nice meeting you.

44
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,411
- Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
- No.

45
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,373
You wanna hear an interesting thing
about stairs?

46
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,916
Not really.

47
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,086
If the height of a step is off
by as little as two millimeters...

48
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,423
- ...most people will trip.
- I don't care.

49
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,092
Two millime...? That doesn't seem right.

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,803
It's true.
I did a series of experiments when I was 12.

51
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,722
My father broke his clavicle.

52
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,766
Is that why they sent you
to boarding school?

53
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,644
No. That was the result
of my work with lasers.

Hi?

We don't mean to interrupt.
We live across the hall.

Oh, that's nice.

65
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,135
No. We don't live together. I mean...

66
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:45,474
...we live together, but in separate,
heterosexual bedrooms.

Well...

00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,987
Oh, welcome to the building.

73
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,490
Oh, thank you.
Maybe we can have coffee sometime.

00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,699

- Bye.
- Bye.

78
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,253
Should we have invited her for lunch?

79
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,464
No. We're gonna start season two
of Battlestar Galactica.

80
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,259
We already watched
the season two DVDs.

81
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,052
Not with commentary.

82
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,847
I think we should be good neighbors.

83
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,849
Invite her over, make her feel welcome.

84
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,687
We never invited Louie/Louise over.

85
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,147
Well, and that was wrong of us.

00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,649
We need to widen our circle.

87
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,860
I have a very wide circle.

88
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,114
I have 212 friends on MySpace.

89
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,492
Yes, and you've never met one of them.

90
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,452
That's the beauty of it.

91
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,707
I'm gonna invite her over.

92
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,584
We'll have a nice meal and chat.

93
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,130
Chat? We don't chat,
at least not off-line.

94
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,882
Well, it's not difficult.

95
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,676
You just listen to what she says...

96
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,471
...and then you say something appropriate
in response.

97
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,932
To what end?

98
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,144
- Hi. Again.
- Hi.

99
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,604
- Hi.
- Hi.

100
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,315
Anyway...

101
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,568
...we brought home Indian food...

102
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,529
...and I know that
moving can be stressful...

103
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,906
...and I find
that when I'm undergoing stress...

104
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,368
...that good food
and company can have a comforting effect.

105
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,373
Also, curry's a natural laxative and
I don't have to tell you that, you know...

106
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,919
...a clean colon is just one less thing
to worry about.

107
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,923
I'm no expert,
but in the context of a lunch invitation...

108
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,760
...you might wanna skip the reference
to bowel movements.

109
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,095
Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?

110
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,181
Yes.

111

Oh, that's so nice. I'd love to.

112
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,601
Great.

00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,103
So, what do you guys do for fun
around here?

114
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,731
Well, today we tried masturbating
for money.

115
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,636
- Okay, well, make yourself at home.
- Okay.

Actually, that's my work.

00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,525
Wow.

121
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,111
Yeah, well, it's just some
quantum mechanics...

122
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,115
...with a little string theory doodling
around the edges. That part's just a joke.

123
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,493
It's a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

124
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,914
So you're, like, one of those

126
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,752
This is really impressive.

127
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,172
I have a board, if you like boards.
This is my board.

128
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,299
Holy smokes.

129
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,761
If by "holy smokes," you mean
a derivative restatement of the stuff...

130
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,306
...you can find scribbled on the wall
of any men's room at MIT, sure.

131
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,308
- What?
- Oh, come on.

132
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:19,104
Who hasn't seen this differential below

133
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,316
At least I didn't have to invent 26
dimensions just to make the math come out.

134
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,236
- I didn't invent them. They're there.
- In what universe?

135
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,196
In all of them, that is the point.

- Yeah?

138
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,162
That's where I sit.

139
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,831
So sit next to me.

140
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,295
- No, I sit there.
- What's the difference?

141
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,047
- What's the difference?
- Here we go.

142
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,426
In winter, that seat is close enough
to the radiator to remain warm...

143
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,803
...yet not so close
as to cause perspiration.

144
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:56,183
In the summer, it's in a cross breeze created
by opening windows there and there.

145
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,437
It faces the television at an angle that is
neither direct, discouraging conversation...

146
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,064
...nor so far wide
as to create a parallax distortion.

147
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:07,319
I could go on,
but I think I've made my point.

148
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,947
Do you want me to move?

149
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,949
- Well...
- Just sit somewhere else.

150
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,828
Fine.

151
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,681

152
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,267
Ah.

153
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,397
Well, this is nice.
We don't have a lot of company over.

154
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,108
That's not true.
Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over.

155
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,276
Yes, I know.

156
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,904
Tuesday night we played Klingon Boggle
until 1 in the morning.

157
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,573
- Yeah, I remember.
- I resent you saying we don't have company.

158
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,493
- That has a negative social implication.
- I said I'm sorry.

159
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,954
So...

160
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,497
...Klingon Boggle?

161
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:05,252
Yeah. It's like regular Boggle,
but in Klingon.

162
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,590
That's probably enough about us.
So tell us about you.

163
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,051
Me? Okay.

164
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,805
I'm a Sagittarius, which probably tells you
way more than you need to know.

165
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,433
Yes, it tells us that you participate
in the mass cultural delusion...

166
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,645
...that the sun's position relative
to arbitrary constellations...

167
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,107
...at the time of your birth
somehow affects your personality.

168
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,069
Participate in the what?

169
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,071
I think what Sheldon's trying to say...

170
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,991
...is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been
our first guess.

171
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,827
Oh, yeah, a lot of people
think I'm a water sign.

172
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,371
Okay, let's see, what else?

173
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,581
Oh, I'm a vegetarian.

174
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,793
No, except for fish,
and the occasional steak. I love steak.

175
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,838
Well, that's interesting.

176
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,590
Leonard can't process corn.

177
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,013
So do you have some sort of a job?

178
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,222
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
Oh, yeah.

179
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,391
I'm a waitress
at The Cheesecake Factory.

180
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,351
I love cheesecake.

181
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,896
- You're lactose intolerant.
- I don't eat it, I think it's a good idea.

182
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,317
Anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay.

183
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,903
It's about this sensitive girl who comes
to L.A. from Lincoln, Nebraska...

184
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,283
...to be an actress and winds up
a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.

185
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,577
So it's based on your life.

186
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,746
No, I'm from Omaha.

187
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,335
If that was a movie, I would go see it.

188
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,711
I know, right?

189
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,588
Okay, let's see, what else?

190
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,758
I guess that's about it.

191
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,552
That's the story of Penny.

192
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,721
Well, it sounds wonderful.

193
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,265
It was.

194
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,935
Until I fell in love with a jerk.

195
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,440
What is happening?

196
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,609
<font color="#E86CE4">(MOUTHS)</font>
I don't know.

197
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,028
Oh, God, you know,
four years I lived with him.

198
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,365
Four years.
That's like as long as high school.

199
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,034
It took you four years
to get through high school?

200
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,748
I just... I can't believe I trusted him.

201
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,254
Should I say something?
I feel I should say something.

202
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,090
You? No, you'll only make it worse.

203
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,425
You wanna know the most pathetic part?

204
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:21,137
Even though I hate his lying,
cheating guts...

205
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,765
...I still love him.

206
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,974
Is that crazy?

207
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,810
Yes.

208
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,523
No, it's not crazy. It's a...

209
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,400
It's a paradox.

210
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,945
Paradoxes are part of nature.
I mean, think about light.

211
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:41,700
If you look at Huygens, light is a wave,
as confirmed by the double-slit experiments.

212
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,202
But then, along comes Albert Einstein...

213
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,330
...and discovers that light
behaves like particles too.

214
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,502
Well, I didn't make it worse.

215
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,463
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm such a mess.

216
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,341
And on top of everything else,
I'm all gross from moving...

217
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,260
...and my stupid shower doesn't work.

218
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,595
Our shower works.

219
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,432
Really? Would it be totally weird
if I used it?

220
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,641
- Yes.
- No.

221
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,809
- No?
- No.

222
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,227
No.

223
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,020
It's right down the hall.

224
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,397
Okay, thanks.

225
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,149
You guys are really sweet.

226
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,491
Well, this is an interesting development.

227
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,245
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>:
How so?

228
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,747
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
It has been some time...

229
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,791
...since we've had a woman
take her clothes off in our apartment.

230
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,960
That's not true.
Remember at Thanksgiving...

231
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,172
...my grandmother with Alzheimer's
had that episode?

232
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:42,177
Point taken. It has been some time since
we've had a woman take her clothes off...

233
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,013
...after which
we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.

234
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,434
The worst part
was watching her carve that turkey.

235
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,646
So, what exactly
are you trying to accomplish here?

236
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,939
Excuse me?

237
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,692
That woman in there
is not going to have sex with you.

238
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,861
Well, I'm not trying to have sex with her.

239
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,739
Oh, good.
Then you won't be disappointed.

240
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,241
What makes you think
she wouldn't have sex with me?

241
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,368
I'm a male and she's a female.

242
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,997
Yes, but not of the same species.

243
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,249
I'm not gonna engage
in hypotheticals here.

244
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:17,128
- I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
- Oh, of course.

245
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,381
That's not to say that
if a carnal relationship were to develop...

246
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,051
...that I wouldn't participate.

247
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,804
However briefly.

248
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,307
Do you think this possibility
will be hindered...

249
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,353
...when she discovers your Luke Skywalker
"no more tears" shampoo?

250
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,564
It's Darth Vader shampoo.

<font color="#E86CE4">(KNOCKING ON DOOR)</font>

252

Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.

No.

And she's not a lady,
she's just a new neighbor.

- And you want us out...

266
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,858
...because you're anticipating coitus?

267
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,236
- I'm not anticipating coitus.
- So she's available for coitus?

268
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,864
Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?

269
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,658
Technically,
that would be coitus interruptus.

Hey, is there a trick
to getting it to switch from tub to shower?

Wow.

296
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,994
I really think we should examine
the chain of causality here.

297

- Must we?
- Event A:

298
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,623
A beautiful woman
stands naked in our shower.

299
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,126
Event B: We drive halfway across town
to retrieve a television set...

300
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,504
...from the aforementioned woman's
ex-boyfriend.

301
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,257
Query: On what plane of existence
is there even a semi-rational link...

302
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,468
...between these events?

303
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,513
She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.

304
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,140
Well, that may be the proximal cause
of our journey...

305
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,726
...but we both know it exists
in contradistinction...

306
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,853
...to the higher-level distal cause.

307
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,856
- Which is?
- You think with your penis.

308
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,527
That's a biological impossibility,
and you didn't have to come.

309
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,905
Oh, yes. I could have stayed behind
to watch Wolowitz hit on Penny...

310
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,408
...in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.

311
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,451
And why can't she get her own TV?

312
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,578
Come on, you know how it is
with breakups.

313

No, I don't, and neither do you.

But I... I broke up with Joyce Kim.

315

You did not break up with Joyce Kim.
She defected to North Korea.

316
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,631
To mend her broken heart.

317
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,761
This situation is much less complicated.

318
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,597
There's some dispute
between Penny and her ex-boyfriend...

319
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,433
...as to who gets custody of the TV.

320
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,353
- She just wanted to avoid a scene with him.
- So we get to have a scene with him?

321
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,023
No, Sheldon,
there's not going to be a scene.

322
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,858

can't even carry a TV.

00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,865
- We're not gonna give up just like that.
- Leonard, the TV's in the building.

336
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,035
We've been denied access to the building,
ergo we are done.

337
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:03,081
Excuse me. If I were to give up at the first
hitch, I never would have identified...

338
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,168
...the fingerprints of string theory
in the aftermath of the big bang.

339
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,171
My apologies. What's your plan?

340
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,854
It's just a privilege
to watch your mind at work.

341
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,441
Come on,
we have a combined IQ of 360.

342
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,694
We should be able to figure out
how to get into a stupid building.

00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,160

- Just grab the door.

00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,039
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>:
This is it.

346
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,874
I'll do the talking.

347
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,752
Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.

348
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,096
- Yeah?
- I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.

349
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,056
From the intercom.

350
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,852
How the hell did you get in the building?

351
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,396
We're scientists.

352
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,567
Tell him about our IQ.

353
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,205
- Leonard.
- What?

354
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,584
- My mom bought me those pants.
- I'm sorry.

355
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,253
You're gonna have to call her.

356
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,675
Sheldon, I am so sorry
I dragged you through this.

357
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:42,096
It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing
and it won't be my last.

358
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,931
And you were right about my motives.

359
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,851
I was hoping to establish
a relationship with Penny...

360
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,271
...that might have someday led to sex.

361
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,357
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Well, you got me out of my pants.

362
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,279
Anyway, I've learned my lesson.
She's out of my league, I'm done with her.

363
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,614
I've got my work.

364
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,742
One day I'll win the Nobel Prize
and then I'll die alone.

365
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,953
Don't think like that.
You're not going to die alone.

366
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,123
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.

367
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,127
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: And you're certainly
not gonna win a Nobel Prize.

368
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,465
This is one of my favorite places
to kick back after a quest.

369
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,467
They have a great house ale.

Wow, cool tiger.

371
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,763
Yeah, I've had him since Level 10.

372
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,932
His name is Buttons.

373
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,559
Anyway, if you had
your own game character...

374
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,646
...we could hang out,
maybe go on a quest.

375
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,107
- That sounds interesting.
- So you'll think about it?

376
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,985
Oh, I don't think
I'll be able to stop thinking about it.

377
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,697
Smooth.

378
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,535
- We're home.
- Oh, my God. What happened?

379
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:52,333
Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards
and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.

380
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,668
I'm so sorry.

381
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,296
I really thought if you guys went
instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.

382
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,048
No, it was a valid hypothesis.

383
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,468
That was a valid hypo...?
What is happening to you?

384
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,097
Really, thank you so much
for going and trying.

385
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,809
You just... You're so terrific.

386
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,189
Why don't you put some clothes on,
I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?

387
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,524
- Really? Great.
- Thank you.

388
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,942
Okay.

389

You're not done with her, are you?

390
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,537
Our babies will be smart and beautiful.

391
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,874
Not to mention imaginary.

392
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,716
- Is Thai food okay with you, Penny?
- Sure.

393
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,884
We can't have Thai,
we had Indian for lunch.

394
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,470
- So?
- They're both curry-based cuisines.

395
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,348
- So?
- It would be gastronomically redundant.

396
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,935
I can see we're going to have to
spell out everything for this girl.

397
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,771
Any ideas, Raj?

398
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,650
Turn left on Lake Street
and head up to Colorado.

that has karaoke.

I'm not sure.

- Any chopsticks?
- Don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.

Here we go.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,147
Thailand has had the fork
since the latter half of the 19th century.

9
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:27,067
They don't put the fork in their mouth,
they use it to put the food on a spoon...

10
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,445
...which then goes into their mouth.

11
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,114

...and Superman catches her.

- One.

Yes, I know, men can't fly.

No, let's assume that they can.

Lois Lane is falling.

59
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,865
Accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second.

60
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,076
Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.

61

Miss Lane, who is now traveling...

62
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,581
...at approximately
120 miles an hour, hits them...

63
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,709
...and is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.

64
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,422
Unless Superman
matches her speed and decelerates.

65
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,299
In what space, sir? In what space?

66
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,884
She's 2 feet above the ground.

67
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,095
If he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.

68
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,598
- It would be a more merciful death.
- That doesn't...

69
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,518
Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption...

70
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,021
...that Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.

Are you listening to yourself?

Superman's flight is a feat of strength.

73
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,360
An extension of his ability
to leap buildings...

74
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,654
...an ability he derives
from exposure to sun...

How does he fly at night?

76
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,992
A combination
of the moon's solar reflection...

77
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,204
...and the energy storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.

Well, we don't have a dolly...

90

or any measurable upper-body strength.

I do not have this!

00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,073
Archimedes would be so proud.

96
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,580
Do you have any ideas?

97
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,875
Yes, but they all involve
a Green Lantern and a power ring.

98
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,964
Easy. Easy.

99
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,803
Okay. Now we've got an inclined plane.

100
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,432
Force required to lift is reduced
by the sine of the angle of the stairs...

101
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,475
...call it 30 degrees, so about half.

102
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:15,105
Exactly half.

103
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,400
Let's push.

104
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,778
Okay.

105
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,031
See, it's moving. This is easy.

106
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,615
It's all in the math.

107
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,244
- What's your formula for the corner?
- What?

108
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,707
Oh, okay.

109
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,962
Okay, yeah, no problem.
Just come up here, help me pull and turn.

110
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,970
Oh, gravity, thou art a heatless bitch.

111
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,098
You do understand
that our efforts here...

112
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:54,770
...will in no way increase the odds of you
having sexual congress with this woman?

113
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,814
Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

114
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,067
Yeah, those would be men
who just had sex.

115
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,653
I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.

116
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,991
In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

117
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,789
Almost there.

118
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,624
- Almost there.

124
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,392
So Penny is a little messy.

125
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,227
A little messy?

126
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,313
The Mandelbrot set
of complex numbers is a little messy.

127
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,606
This is chaos.

128
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,733
Excuse me.

129
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,193
Explain to me a system...

130
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,530
...where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid?

131
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,657
I'm just inferring that this is a couch...

132
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,786
...because the evidence suggests
the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.

133
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,998
Did it occur to you that not everyone
has the compulsive need to sort...

134
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,626
...organize and label
the entire world around them?

135
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,129
No.

136
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,297
Well, they don't.

137
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,924
Hard as it may be to believe...

138
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,595
...most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

139
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,349
Excuse me, but I think
we've both found that helpful at times.

140
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,813
- Come on, we should go.
- Hang on.

141
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,650
- What are you doing?
- I'm straightening up.

142
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,694
Sheldon, this is not your home.

143
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,448
This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

144
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,703
When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

145
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,079
Because it was immaculate.

146
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,248
I mean, you open that man's closet...

147
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:43,712
...it was left to right, evening gowns,
cocktail dresses and his police uniforms.

148
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,091
- What were you doing in his closet?
- I helped him run some cable for a webcam.

149
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,051
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Penny.

150
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,345
This just arrived.
Brought this up. Just now.

151
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,723
Great. Was it hard getting up the stairs?

152
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,057
- No.
- No?

153
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,895
- No.
- No.

- Okay, great.

I just want you to know
that you don't have to live like this.

I'm here for you.

- It's a joke.
- I don't get it.

You can't break into a woman's apartment

169

I had no choice.

170
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,820
I couldn't sleep knowing that just
outside my bedroom was our living room...

171
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,281
...and outside our living room
was that hallway...

172
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,742
...and immediately adjacent
to that hallway was this.

173
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,912
Do you realize that if Penny wakes up...

...there is no reasonable explanation

I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

No, no. You gave me an explanation.

It's reasonableness will be determined
by a jury of your peers.

00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,864
Yes, but only to clean.

227
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,534
Really more to organize,
you're not actually dirty, per se.

228
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,870

Yes, we discussed it at length last night.

232

In my apartment? While I was sleeping?

233
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,340
And snoring.
And that's probably just a sinus infection.

234
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:43,094
But it could be sleep apnea. You might
wanna see an otorhinolaryngologist.

235
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,557
The throat doctor.

or a general surgeon.

Well, she was upset at first...

The hallmark

- It is an inefficient design.

...which means all this space

- We could put her stereo back there.
- And control it how?

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,235
Didn't like the look of the guy
she was with.

70
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,195
Because he looks better than you?

71
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,906
Yeah.

72
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,450
He was kind of dreamy.

73
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,161
At least now
you can retrieve the black box...

74
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,831
...from the smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her...

75
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,835
...and analyze the data so that
you don't crash into geek mountain again.

76
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:19,216
I disagree. Love is not a sprint.
It's a marathon.

77
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:24,346
A relentless pursuit that only ends
when she falls into your arms...

78
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,474
...or hits you with the pepper spray.

79
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,351
No, I'm done with Penny.

80
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,854
I'm gonna be more realistic
and go after someone my own speed.

81
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,107
- Like who?
- I don't know.

82
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,316
Olivia Geiger?

83
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,362
The dietitian at the cafeteria
with the limp and the lazy eye?

84
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,408
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't think you have a shot there.

85
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,037
I have noticed that Leslie Winkle
recently started shaving her legs.

86
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,291
Now, given that winter is coming,
one can assume she's signaling...

87
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,667
...sexual availability.

88
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,545
I don't know.
You guys work in the same lab.

89
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,047
- So?
- There are pitfalls.

90
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,716
Trust me, I know.

91
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,011
When it comes
to sexual-harassment law...

92
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,139
...I'm a bit of a self-taught expert.

93
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,019
Howard, if I were to ask Leslie Winkle out,
it would just be for dinner.

94
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,023
I'm not gonna walk into the lab,
ask her to strip naked and dance for me.

95
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,442
Oh, then you're probably okay.

96
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,114
- Hello, Leslie.
- Hi, Leonard.

97
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,408
- I'd like to propose an experiment...
- Goggles.

98
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,868
Right.

99
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,998
- I would like to propose an experiment.
- Hang on.

100
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,543
I'm trying to see how long it takes
a 500-kilowatt oxygen-iodine laser...

101
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,837
...to heat up my cup of noodles.

102
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,758
I've done it.
About two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone.

103
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,970
<font color="#E86CE4">(MACHINE WHIRRING)</font>

104
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,726
Anyway, I was thinking more
of a biosocial exploration...

105
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,770
...with a neurochemical overlay.

106
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,774
Wait, are you asking me out?

107
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,110
I was going to characterize it
as the modification...

108
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:06,406
...of our colleague/friendship paradigm
with the addition of a date-like component.

109
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:10,410
But we don't need to quibble
over terminology.

110
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,454
What sort of experiment
would you propose?

111
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,165
There is a generally accepted
pattern in this area.

112
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,585
I pick you up, take you to a restaurant,
then we would see a movie.

113
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,088
Probably a romantic comedy
featuring the talents...

114
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,340
...of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.

115
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,008
Interesting.

116
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,761
And would you agree
the primary way we would evaluate...

117
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,807
...the success or failure of the date would
be based on the biochemical reaction...

118
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,394
- ...during the good-night kiss?
- Heart rate, pheromones, et cetera, yes.

119
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,021
Why don't we stipulate
the date goes well...

120
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,981
...and move to the key variable?

121
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,858
- You mean kiss you now?
- Yes.

122
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,112
- Define the parameters of the kiss.
- Closed mouth, but romantic.

123
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,030
- Mint?
- Thank you.

00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,384
- What do you think?
- You proposed the experiment.

127
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,970
I think you should present

128
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,680
Fair enough.

129
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,100
On the plus side, it was a good kiss,
reasonable technique...

130
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,852
...no extraneous spittle.

131
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,355
On the other hand, no arousal.

00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,024
- None?
- None.

Ah.

Well, thank you for your time.

135
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,532
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

136
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,163
None at all?

137

Sheldon, if you were a robot
and I knew and you didn't...

138
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,093
...would you want me to tell you?

139
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,054
That depends.

140
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:58,894
When I learn that I'm a robot,
will I be able to handle it?

141
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,191
Maybe, although the history
of science fiction is not on your side.

142
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,735
Okay. Uh, let me ask you this.

143
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,112
When I learn that I'm a robot...

144
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,033
...would I be bound by
Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?

145
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,454
You might be bound by them right now.

146
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,249
That's true.

147
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:25,879
- Have you ever harmed a human being?
- Of course not.

148
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,257
Have you ever harmed yourself,
except in cases where a human being...

149
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,092
...would have been endangered?

150
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,762
- Well, no.
- I smell robot.

151
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:41,353
- Hey, what's going on?
- Internet's been down for half an hour.

152
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,232
Also, Sheldon may be a robot.

153
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,861
So how did it go with Leslie?

154
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,366
Oh, we tried kissing,
but the Earth didn't move.

155
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,954
I mean, any more than the 383 miles
that it was gonna move anyway.

156
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,916
Oh, I've seen that look before.

157
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,461
This is just gonna be two weeks
of moping and tedious emo songs...

158
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,090
...and calling me to come down
to pet stores to look at cats.

159
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,635
I don't know if I can take it.

160
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,471

Well, as usual,
Wolowitz has the solution.

No, but you're right.

00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,340

- Good afternoon, Penny.

So, hi, hey. Uh...

211
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,692
I was wondering
if you had plans for dinner.

212
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,235
Uh, you mean, dinner tonight?

213
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,322
There is an inherent ambiguity
in the word "dinner."

214
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,325
Technically,
it refers to the largest meal of the day.

215
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,036
So to clarify here,
by dinner, I mean supper.

216
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,205
- Supper?
- Or dinner, you know.

217
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,126
I was thinking 6:30 if you can go,
or a different time.

218
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,461
Uh, 6:30 is great.

219
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,087
Really?

220
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,216
- Great.
- Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.

221
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,426
Us guys?

222
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,471
Oh, you know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj.
Who all is coming?

223
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,931
They...

224
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,059
...might all be there.

225
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,897
Or a subset of them might be there.

226
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,357
Algebraically speaking,
there are too many unknowns.

227
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,526
For example,
Sheldon had Quizno's for lunch.

228
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,237
Sometimes he finds that filling,
other times he doesn't.

229
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,699
It's no fault of Quizno's.
They have a varied menu.

230
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,911
Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.

231
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,038
Great.

232
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,706
- Did we say a time?
- Six-thirty.

233
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,916
Still good?

234
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,709
- It's fine.
- It's not carved in stone.

235
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,169
No. Six-thirty is great.

236
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,421
I'll get my chisel. Heh-heh.

237
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,132
Why?

238
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,222
To carve the...
Okay, I'll see you at 6:30.

239
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,692
How do I look?

240
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,949
Could you be more specific?

241
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,078
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

242
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:55,333
No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.

243
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,379
- What time is your date?
- Six-thirty.

244
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,923
Perfect, that gives you
two hours and 15 minutes...

245
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,301
...for that dense molecular cloud
of Aramis to dissipate.

246
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,639
- Is it too much?
- Not if you're a rugby team.

247
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,269
By the way, you didn't join us
because you stuffed yourself...

248
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,646
...with a chicken-carbonara sub
at Quizno's.

249
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,231
Why would I join you?

250
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,733
No reason.

251
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,572
Oh, you know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

252
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,116
Oh, no, well, now,
there's always the possibility...

253
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,493
...that alcohol and poor judgment
on her part...

254
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,037
...might lead to a nice romantic evening.

255
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,834
You're right. Alcohol, poor judgment.
It could go well.

256
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,504
Of course, there's the other possibility
that this day kicks off...

257
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,757
...an unpleasant six months of you
passing awkwardly in the hall...

258
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,802
...until one of you breaks down
and moves to another zip code.

259
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,264
You could have stopped at,
"It could go well."

260
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,892
If I could have, I would have.

261
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,895
I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy.
There's no reason...

262
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,856
...we couldn't go to the restaurant
and have a lovely dinner.

263
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:04,652
Maybe take a walk afterwards,
talk about things we have in common.

264
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,655
"You love pottery? I love pottery."

265
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,700
You know, there's a pause.
We both know what's happening.

266
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,827
We kiss. It's a little tentative at first.

267
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,997
But I realize, she's kissing me back,
she's biting my lower lip.

268
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,333
She wants me.
This thing is going the distance.

269
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,501
We're gonna have sex.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

270
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,840
Is the sex starting now?

271
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,884
I'm having a panic attack.

272
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,387
Oh, okay. Well, then, calm down.

273
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,431
If I could,
I wouldn't be having an attack.

274
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,017
- That's why they call it a panic attack.
- All right.

275
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,727
Would you just sit down?

276
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,480
- Yeah, sit down. Now close your eyes.
- Why?

277
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,856
- Just do it.
- Okay.

278
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,026
Now, try to increase
your alpha-wave activity.

279
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,946
- What?
- It's a biofeedback technique.

280
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,239
It's relaxation
through brainwave manipulation.

281
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,575
I read it
in the Journal of American Neuroscience.

282
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,453
It was sparsely sourced,
but I think the science is valid.

283
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,206
I probably have it here somewhere.

284
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,500
Who am I kidding?
I can't go through with this.

285
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,377
- You need to call her and cancel.
- Me?

286
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,087
- Yes.
- What should I tell her?

287
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,673
- I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
- Okay.

288
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,384
Not the kind that would make her
wanna take care of me.

289
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,763
But nothing so critical that she'll feel
uncomfortable if I wanna try this again.

290
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,432
Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal.

291
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,690
I'll just tell her that you had
a routine colonoscopy...

292
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,692
...and haven't quite bounced back.

293
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,236
- Give me the phone.
- I thought you wanted to cancel.

294
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,239
I can't. If I don't show up,
she'll still be expecting you.

295
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,783
Why would she be expecting me?

296
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,830
Stop asking me all these questions.
I need to take another shower.

297
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,752
- Are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
- Oh, yeah.

298
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,254
No.

299
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,840
Turns out that Raj and Howard
had to work...

300
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:54,470
...and Sheldon had a colonoscopy,
and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.

301
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,724
Ooh, my uncle just had
a colonoscopy.

302
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,978
You're kidding. Well, then,
that's something we have in common.

303
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,230
How?

304
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:10,903
We both have people in our lives
who wanna nip intestinal polyps in the bud.

305
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,870
So, what's new in the world of physics?

306
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,539
Nothing.

307
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,958
Really? Nothing?

308
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:29,630
Well, with the exception of string theory,
not much has happened since the 1930s...

309
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,507
...and you can't prove string theory.

310
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:37,138
At best you can say, "Hey, look, my idea
has an internal logical consistency."

311
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,934
Ah. Well, I'm sure things will pick up.

312
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,024
What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?

313
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,651
Oh, uh, not much.

314
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:55,198
Oh, we do have a chocolate key lime
that's moving pretty well.

315
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,826
Good.

316
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,917
Uh, what about
your, uh, hallway friend?

317
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,505
Doug? Oh, yeah. I don't know. I mean,
you know, he's nice and funny, but...

318
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,924
- Can I get you started with some drinks?
- No. Bzzz.

319
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,344
- You were saying, "But..."?
- I'd like a drink.

320
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,764
Just say the "but" thing about Doug,
and then I'll get her back.

321
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,184
Okay, well, it...
I don't know. It's just me.

322
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,520
I'm still getting over this break-up
with Kurt.

323
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,523
And this thing with Doug
would just be rebound sex.

324
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:33,277
Ugh. Don't get me started
on rebound sex.

325
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,113
It's just... It's my pattern.

326
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,490
I break up, then I find some cute guy...

327
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,369
...and then it's just
36 meaningless hours of...

328
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,787
Well, you know.

329
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,249
I'm not sure that I do. Um...

330
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:52,421
Is that one 36-hour experience
or is that 36 hours spread out over...

331
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,050
...say, one glorious summer?

332
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,718
No. It's usually over a weekend.

333
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,638
And trust me,
you do not feel good after it.

334
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,224
Well, chafing, right?

335
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,476
Emotionally.

336
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,563
Of course, yeah. Emotional chafing.

337
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,780
Hey, do you wanna see something cool?

338
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:23,411
I can make this olive go into this glass
without touching it.

339
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,289
- How?
- Physics.

340
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,796
Wow, centrifugal force.

341
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,258
Actually, it's centripetal force,
which is an inward force...

342
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,761
...generated by the glass
acting on the olive. Ooh.

343
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,847
Excuse me.

344
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,142
Now, if you were biting on the olive...

345
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,854
...you'd be in a non-inertial
reference frame and would...

346
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,442
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

347
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,652
Did you spill ketchup?

348
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,155
- No.
- I'm not okay.

349
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,160
You don't wanna go
to the emergency room?

350
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,369
No, no. I'm okay.

351
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,954
It stopped bleeding.

352
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,082
Anyway, you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

353
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,502
Yes, but I get carsick too, so...

354
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,712
Okay.

355
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,589
Sorry about your car, by the way.

356
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,384
Oh, no, it's fine.
You got most of it out the window.

357
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,887
The poor guy on the bike.

358
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,641
I had a nice time.

359
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,768
Yeah, me too.

360
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,145
Well, um, good night.

361
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,189
Good night.

362
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,816
- Leonard.
- Yeah?

363
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,819
Was this supposed to be a date?

364
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,322
This?

365
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,908
No.

366
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,160
No, of course not.

367
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,580
This was just you and me hanging out
with guys who didn't show up...

368
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,875
...because of work and a colonoscopy.

369
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,670
Okay. I was just checking.

370
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,300
When I take a girl on a date...
And I do, heh.

371
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,637
...she knows she's been dated.

372
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,349
Capital D. Heh.

373
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:13,312
Bold face, underlined, like, dated.

374
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,108
I think I might have a concussion.
I'm gonna go lay down.

375
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,693
Good night.

376
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,658
- So how was your date?
- Awesome. Heh.

377
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,873
Score one for liquor and poor judgment.

00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,754
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: You know, I've been thinking
about time travel again.

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,757
Why? Did you hit a roadblock
with invisibility?

3
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,468
Put it on the back burner.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,639
Anyway, it occurs to me,
if I ever did perfect a time machine...

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,933
...I'd go into the past
and give it to myself.

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,645
Thus eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,816
- Interesting.
- Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,818
Sounds like a breakthrough.

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,487
Should I call Science
and tell them to hold the cover?

10
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,990
It's time travel, Leonard.
I will have done that.

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,910
I guess congratulations are in order.

12
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,040
No, congratulations
will have been in order.

13
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,208
You know,
I'm not going to enjoy this party.

14

<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>:

<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: The last party,
Professor Finkleday cornered me...

16
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,841
...and talked about spelunking
for 45 minutes.

17
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,051
Yes, I was there.

18
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,053
You know what's interesting
about caves?

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,555
- What?
- Nothing.

20
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:01,810
We'll avoid Finkleday, meet the new head,
congratulate him, shake his hand and go.

"Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser.

22
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,983
How fortunate for you
the university has chosen to hire you...

23
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,236
...despite the fact you've done
no original research in 25 years...

24
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,322

of science to anecdotes...

- Of course, but it's all Indian food.

- What?

Howard brought a date?

39
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,915
A more plausible explanation is that his
work in robotics has made an amazing leap.

Hey, what up, science bitches?

41
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,881

Right. Sorry.

Hi, fellas.

46
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,559
- Eric Gablehauser.
- Howard Wolowitz.

47
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,436
Howard, nice to meet you. And you are?

48
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,773
An actual real scientist.

49
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,611
How was that?

50
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,574
I can't believe he fired me.

51
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,118
You did call him
a glorified science teacher...

52
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,873
...whose last successful experiment
was lighting his own farts.

53
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:50,711
In my defense, I prefaced that by saying
"with all due respect."

54
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,656
Morning.

55
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,867
You're making eggs for breakfast?

56
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,037
This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.

57
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,582
Oh. Because it looks a lot like breakfast.

58
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,628
I finally have time to test my hypothesis
about the separation of water molecules...

59
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,381
...from the egg proteins
and its impact vis-à-vis taste.

60
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,801
Sounds yummy.

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,054
I look forward to your work with bacon.

62
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,056
As do I.

63
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,977
You know, I'm sure if you just apologize
to Gablehauser he'd give your job back.

64
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,896
I don't want my job back.

65
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,983
I've spent three and a half years
staring at grease boards full of equations.

66
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,569
Before that,
I spent four years working on my thesis.

67
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,907
Before that, I was in college,
and before that I was in the fifth grade.

68
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,495
This is my first day off in decades
and I'm going to savor it.

69
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,540
Okay. I'll let you get back
to fixing your eggs.

00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,919

Do you guys need anything?

00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,089
Oh. This would be
one of those circumstances...

78
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,801
...people unfamiliar with the law

79
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,720
- I'm sorry?
- I need eggs.

- Four dozen should suffice.
- Four dozen?

Evenly distributed amongst brown, white,
free-range, large, extra-large and jumbo.

- Never mind, you won't get it right.

83
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,859
I'd better come with you.

Oh, yay.

How come
you didn't go in to work today?

I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.

Theoretical physicists do not get canned.

89
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,087
But, yeah.

90
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,256
Maybe it's for the best.

91
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,509
You know, I always say, "When one door
closes, another one opens."

92
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,720
No, it doesn't.

93
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,348
Not unless the doors
are connected by relays.

94
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,933
- Or there are motion sensors involved.
- No, I meant...

95
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:56,521
Or if the first door closing creates a change
of air pressure that acts upon the second.

96
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,732
Never mind.

97
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,070
Slow down. Slow down.
Please, slow down.

98
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,279
We're fine.

99
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,490
You're not leaving
enough space between cars.

100
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,699
Oh, sure I am.

101
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,534
No, no, let me do the math for you.

102
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,120
This car weighs, let's say, 4000 pounds.

103
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,206
Now, add 140 for me, 120 for you...

104
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,417
- One-twenty?
- Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you?

105
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,420
Is your body mass
somehow tied into your self-worth?

106
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,756
Well, yeah.

107
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,965
Interesting.

108
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,511
Anyway, that gives us a total weight of,
let's say, 4400 pounds.

109
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,805
Let's say 4390.

110
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,348
Fine.

And thank you, ordinary person.

Hey, you wanna hear an interesting thing
about tomatoes?

123
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,473
No. No, not really.

124
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,518
Listen, didn't you say
you needed some eggs?

125
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,021
Yes, but anyone who knows anything
about bacterial growth...

126
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,150
...knows to pick up their refrigerated foods
on the way out.

127
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,111
Oh, okay, maybe you should start
heading on out, then.

128
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,364
No, this is fun.

129
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,367
The thing about tomatoes,
and I think you'll enjoy this...

130
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,787
...is they're shelved with the vegetables,
but they're technically a fruit.

131
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,205
- Hmm. Interesting.
- Isn't it?

132
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,041
No, I mean what you find enjoyable.

133
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,505
Oh, boy.

134
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,050
What now?

135
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,761
Well, there's some value
to taking a multivitamin...

136
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,139
...but the human body
can only absorb so much.

137
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:59,186
What you're buying here
are the ingredients for very expensive urine.

138
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,814
Well, maybe that's what I was going for.

139
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,816
Well, then you'll want some manganese.

140
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,991
Well, that was fun.

141
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,619
Tomorrow we can go
to one of those warehouse stores.

142
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,870
I don't know, Sheldon.

143
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,374
It's gonna take me a while to recover
from all the fun I had today.

144
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,212
Are you sure? There are a lot
of advantages to buying in bulk.

145
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,797
For example, I noticed
you purchase your tampons...

146
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,424
...one month's supply at a time.

147
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,970
- What?
- Well, think about it.

148
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,555
It doesn't spoil...

149
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,267
...and you're going to be needing them
for at least the next 30 years.

150
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,854
You want me to buy
30 years' worth of tampons?

151
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,105
Well, 30, 35...

152
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,067
- When did your mother go into menopause?
- Okay.

153
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,569
I'm not talking about this with you.

154
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,820
Oh, Penny.

155
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,908
This is a natural human process
and we're talking about significant savings.

156

in a 28-day cycle...

164
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,613
It's an experiment.

165
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,409
- What happened to your egg research?
- Oh, that was a dead end.

166
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,662
Scrambled eggs are as good
as they're ever going to be.

167

So fish.

168
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,628
I read an article about scientists
who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish...

169
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:54,301
...into other animals, and I thought,
"Hey, fish nightlights."

170
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,013
Fish nightlights.

171
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,266
It's a billion-dollar idea. Shhh!

to Gablehauser and get your job back?

174
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,860
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I have too much to do.

175
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,154
Like luminous fish.

176
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,198
- Shhh!
- I'm sorry, I didn't...

177
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,784

00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,267
...loom."

192
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,938
Mom, what are you doing here?

193
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,523
Leonard called me.

194
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,817
I know, but why?

195
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,444
Because one of the great minds
of the 21 st century...

196
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,823
...is raising glow-in-the-dark fish
and weaving serapes.

197
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,784
This is not a serape. This is a poncho.

198
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,121
A serape is open at the sides,
a poncho is closed. This is a poncho.

199
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,417
And neither is a reason
to call someone's mother.

200
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,253
Really?
When was the last time you left the house?

201
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,505
I went to the market with Penny.

202
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,424
Yeah, that was three weeks ago.

203
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,633
Well, then, buckle up.

204
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,887
In the next four to eight days,
she's going to get very crabby.

205
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,267
Sweetheart,
your little friend is concerned about you.

206
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,727
Yes, well, I'm not a child.

207
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,980
I'm a grown man
capable of living my life as I see fit.

208
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,316
And I certainly don't need someone
telling on me to my mother.

209
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,027
Wait, where are you going?

210
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,239
To my room and no one's allowed in.

211
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,699
<font color="#E86CE4">(DOOR SLAMS)</font>

212
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,326
- He gets his temper from his daddy.
- Ah.

213
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,871
- He's got my eyes.
- I see.

214
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,583
All that science stuff,
that comes from Jesus.

215
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,421
Sheldon, your mom made dinner.

216
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,630
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
I'm not hungry.

217
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,717
Oh. Leonard, don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.

218
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,969
He may stay in there till the rapture.

219
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,806
Are we so sure that's a bad thing?

220
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,433
I love the boy to death...

221
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,687
...but he has been difficult
since he fell out of me at the Kmart.

222
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,065
Excuse me for being so bold...

223
00:12:56,233 --> 00:13:00,069
...but I now see where Sheldon gets
his smoldering good looks.

224
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:04,282
Oh. Honey, that ain't gonna work,
but you keep trying.

225
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,868
I made chicken.

226
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:12,040
I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.

227
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,048
You know, we have an Indian gentleman
at our church.

228
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,467
A Dr. Patel. It's a beautiful story.

229
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:27,013
The Lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20 percent off on LASEK.

230
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,098
You know, those that needed it.

231
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,559
That is a lovely story.

232
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,478
Are we gonna do anything
about Sheldon?

233
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,189
Oh, we will.
You have to take your time with Sheldon.

234
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,525
His father, God rest his soul, used to say:

235
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,903
"Mary, you have to take your time
with Sheldon."

236
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,573
- Sounds like a wise man.
- Oh, not so wise.

237
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,827
He once tried to fight a bobcat
for some licorice.

238
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:55,250
So everybody grab a plate
and a pretty placemat that Shelly wove.

239
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,752
Has Shelly ever freaked out
like this before?

240
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,962
Oh, all the time.

241
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,339
I remember one summer
when he was 13...

242
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,634
...he built a small nuclear reactor
in the shed...

243
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,929
...and told everybody he was gonna provide
electricity for the town.

244
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,517
Well, the only problem was, he had no,
what you call, fissionable materials.

245
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,187
Anyway, when he went on the Internet
to get some...

246
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,817
...a man from the government came by
and sat him down real gentle...

247
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,779
...and told him it's against the law
to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.

248
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,324
- Well, what happened?
- Well, poor boy had a fit.

249
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,661
Locked himself in his room
and built a sonic death ray.

250
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,956
- A death ray?
- Well, that's what he called it.

251
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,292
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.
Heh.

252
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,795
It pissed our dog off to no end.

253
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,133
You know, you two make a cute couple.

254
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,467
<font color="#E86CE4">(BOTH LAUGH)</font>

255
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,429
I... No, no.
No, we're not a couple. We're singles.

256
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:54,642
Two singles. Like those individually
wrapped slices of cheese that...

257
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,021
Or friends.

258
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,315
- Did I pluck a nerve there?
- Oh, yeah.

259
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,109
Okay.
All right, everybody, it's time to eat.

260
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:09,324
Oh, Lord, we thank you for this meal
and for all your bounty.

261
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,995
And we pray that you help Sheldon
get back on his rocker.

262
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:18,416
Now, after a moment of silent meditation,
I'm gonna end with "in Jesus' name"...

263
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,336
...but you two
don't feel any obligation to join in.

264
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,424
Unless, of course,
the Holy Spirit moves you.

265
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,019
Oh, my God,
this is the best cobbler I've ever had.

266
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,856
It was always Sheldon's favorite.
You know what the secret ingredient is?

267
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,566
- Love?
- Lard.

268
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,200
- Hey, look who's com...
- Shh. You'll spook him.

269
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,871
He's like a baby deer.
You gotta let him come to you.

270
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,589
This is ridiculous.

271
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,383
Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it.

272
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,720
You're a physicist. You belong at the
university doing research, not in your room.

273
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,518
<font color="#E86CE4">(DOOR SLAMS)</font>

274
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,813
You don't hunt, do you?

00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,652
<font color="#E86CE4">(KNOCK ON DOOR)</font>

276
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,531
Good morning, Snickerdoodle.

277
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,907
- Morning.
- Oh.

278
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,618
Well, that looks awful fancy.
What is that?

279
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:42,333
It's my idea of what DNA would look like
in a silicon-based life form.

280
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:47,171
But intelligently designed
by a creator, right?

281
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,258
What do you want, Mom?

282
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,637
You know how your daddy used to say
that you can only fish for so long...

283
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,682
...before you gotta throw
a stick of dynamite in the water?

284
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,977
- Yeah?
- Well, I'm done fishing.

285
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,605
- You put those on.
- What for?

286
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,649
Because you're gonna go
to your office...

287
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,360
...apologize to your boss
and get your job back.

288
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,945
- No.
- I'm sorry.

289
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,241
Did I start that sentence with the words
"if it please Your Highness"?

290
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,662
I'm not going to.
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

291
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,205
Now, you listen here.

292
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,875
I have been telling you since you were 4.

293
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,004
It's okay to be smarter than everybody,
but you can't go around pointing it out.

294
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,965
- Why not?
- Because people don't like it.

295
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,094
Remember all the ass-kickings
from the neighbor kids?

296
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,849
Now, let's get cracking.

297
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,978
Shower, shirt, shoes and let's shove off.

298
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:50,151
Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings
if that stupid death ray had worked.

299
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,157
Problem solved.

300
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,868
Really? That's impressive.

301
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,829
Leonard, the Lord never gives us
more than we can handle.

302
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,415
Thankfully, he blessed me
with two other children...

303
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,000
...who are dumb as soup.

304
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,883
Excuse me, Dr. Gablehauser,
are you busy?

305
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:18,054
- Well, actually...
- Sheldon, he's just doodling. Get in here.

306
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,184
- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Cooper.

307
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,021
Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight.

308
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,192
Um...

309
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,530
As you know, several weeks ago
in our first encounter...

310
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,907
...we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot...

311
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,617
...when I called you an idiot.

312
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,454
And I just wanted to say
that I was wrong...

313
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,415
...to point it out.

314
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,961
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.

315
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,548
- Dr. Eric Gablehauser.
- Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom.

316
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,009
Now, that's impossible. You must've
had him when you were a teenager.

317
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,512
Oh, aren't you sweet. His father's dead.

318
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,267
- Recently?
- Long enough.

319
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,019
Please.

320
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,397
Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?

321
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,945
Okay.

322
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,617
Hey, how did it go?

323
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,578
I got my job back.

324
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,913
Really? What happened?

325
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,583
I'm not quite sure.

326
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,337
It involves a part of the human experience
that has always eluded me.

327
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,132
Well, that narrows it down.

328
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,764
I'm very proud of you, honey.
You showed a lot of courage today.

329
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,225
Thanks, Mom.

330
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,230
- Mom?
- Mm-hm.

331
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,068
Is Dr. Gablehauser
going to be my new daddy?

332
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,116
We'll see. Sleep tight.

1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,671
All right,
I'm moving my infantry division...

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,757
...augmented by a battalion of orcs
from Lord of the Rings.

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,592
We flank the Tennessee volunteers...

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,929
...and the North once again
wins the Battle of Gettysburg.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,182
Not so fast. Remember, the South
still has two infantry divisions.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,643
Plus Superman and Godzilla.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,687
No, no, no. Orcs are magic.

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,355
Superman is vulnerable to magic.

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,566
Not to mention,
you already lost Godzilla...

10
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,027
...to the Illinois cavalry and Hulk.

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:32,406
Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee
charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?

12
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,158
- You guys ready to order?
- Hang on.

13
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,909
Shiva and Ganesh?

14
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,579
The Hindu gods
against the entire Union Army?

15
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,456
And orcs.

16
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,124
I'll be back.

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,794
Excuse me. Ganesh is the remover
of obstacles and Shiva's the destroyer.

18
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,547
When the smoke clears,
Lincoln will be speaking Hindi...

19
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,299
...and drinking mint juleps.

20
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,261
My boss says you have to either
order or leave and never come back.

21
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,806
What do you recommend for someone
with a man-sized appetite...

22
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,434
...from a morning of
weight-training and cardio-funk?

23
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,685

26

I don't know what's good.

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,446
- Well, it's all good.
- Statistically unlikely.

28
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,324
Just get a hamburger.
You like hamburgers.

29
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,493
I like the hamburgers
where we usually eat.

30
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,704
You can't make the assumption
that I'll like the hamburgers here.

31
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,499
I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.

32
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,542
Which one,
the classic, the ranch house...

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,920
...the barbeque burger
or the Kobe burger?

34
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,005
Can't we just go to Big Boy?

35
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:34,802
- They only have one burger, the Big Boy.
- The barbeque burger's like the Big Boy.

36
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,346
In a world that already
includes a Big Boy...

37
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,848
...why would I settle for something
like a Big Boy?

38
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,142
Because you are not at Big Boy.

39
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,854
- Fine. I'll have the barbeque burger.
- Make it two.

40
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,315
Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.

41
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,901
Hey, Leonard. Hi, guys.

42
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,236
- Hey.
- Hey, Leslie.

43
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:56,115
- I didn't know you ate here.
- We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.

44
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,493
Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across
the hall from Sheldon and me.

45
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,412
And walks in quiet beauty
like the night.

46
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,082
Howard, I've asked you not to do that.

47
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,627
Leslie and I do research together
at the university.

48
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,004
Oh, wow. A girl scientist.

49
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,465
Yep. Come for the breasts,

50
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,634
So I'm glad I ran into you.

51

53
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,100
Switched over to high-energy
radiation research, had a mishap.

54
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,186
And now the other guys
are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

55
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,564
- So are you in?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

56
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:32,109
- We rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
- Why at my place?

57
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,612
Yeah, Department of Energy said
our regular space is kind of a hot zone.

58
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,407
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too.

59
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,784
Leonard, I didn't know
you played the cello.

60
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,120
Yeah, my parents felt
that naming me Leonard...

61
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,581
...and putting me
in advanced-placement classes...

62
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,666
...wasn't getting me beaten up enough.

63
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,586
If you're into music, I happen
to be a human beatbox...

64
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,337

No, no. What, are you kidding?

He asked her out once.
It was an embarrassing failure.

00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,817
Thank you, Sheldon.

72
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,153
I'm sorry.
Was that supposed to be a secret?

73
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,115
That's too bad.
You guys would make a cute couple.

74
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,577
- Oh, dear.
- What's the matter?

75
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,912
She didn't take my order.

76
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,290
How could she take your order
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?

77
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,461
Nevertheless,
this will be reflected in her tip.

00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,966
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: What did Penny mean,
"you'd make a cute couple"?

I assume she meant
the two of you...

80
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,513
...would constitute a couple
that others might consider cute.

81
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:49,853
An alternate and less likely interpretation
is that you could manufacture one.

82
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,732
As in, "Look, Leonard and Leslie
made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb.

Aren't they adorable?"

84
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,445
If Penny didn't know
that Leslie had turned me down...

85
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,824
...then that would mean that she, Penny,
thought I should ask her, Leslie, out...

86
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,827
...indicating that Penny had no interest
in me asking her out.

87
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,330
But because she did know
I had asked Leslie out...

88
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,582
...and that she, Leslie,
had turned me down...

89
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,169
...then she, Penny,
could be offering consolation.

- Is it the waitress?
- Penny? What about her?

123
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,643
I saw your pupils dilate
when you looked at her...

124
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,188
...which, unless you're a heroin addict,
points to sexual attraction.

I did have a poppy-seed bagel
for breakfast...

126
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,653
...which could give
a positive urine test for opiates...

...but certainly not dilate my pupils...

128

in bringing it up.

191
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,796
Someone touched my board.

192
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,843
Oh, God, my board.

193
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,471
<font color="#E86CE4">(PANTING)</font>
Leonard.

194
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,473
Leonard!

195
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,350
Hey, what's the matter?

196
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,728
Equations.
Someone's tampered with my equations.

197
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,146
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

198
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,732
Look at the beta function
of quantum chromodynamics.

199
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,984
The sign's been changed.

200
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,485
Oh, yeah.

201
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,029
But doesn't that fix the problem
you've been having?

202
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,490
Are you insane?
Are you out of your mind?

203
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,035
Are you...? Hey, look, that fixes
the problem I've been having.

204
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,038
You're welcome.

205
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,333
You did this?

206
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,503
Yeah. I noticed it when I got up
to get water, so I fixed it.

207
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,757
Now you can show quarks are
asymptotically free at high energies.

208
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,383
Pretty cool, huh?

209
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,845
"Cool"?

210
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,847
Listen, I gotta get to the lab.

211
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,016
Thanks for a great night.

212
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,643
Thank you. I'll see you at work.

213
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,272
- Hold on. Hold on.
- What?

214
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,358
- Who told you you could touch my board?
- No one.

215
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,069
I don't come into your house
and touch your board.

216
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,572
There are no incorrect equations
on my board.

217
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,412
Oh, that is so, so...

218
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,751
I'm sorry, I gotta run. If you
come up with an adjective, text me.

<font color="#E86CE4">(DOOR CLOSES)</font>

220
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,050
Inconsiderate. That is the adjective.
Inconsiderate.

221
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,763
You can stare at your board all day,
she's still going to be right.

222
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,556
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
I'm not staring, I'm mulling.

223
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,475
- Oh, hey, Leonard.
- Hi.

224
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,063
<font color="#E86CE4">(TEASING)</font>
So how's it going?

225
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,442
<font color="#E86CE4">(IMITATES PENNY)</font>
Pretty good.

226
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,696
Just pretty good? I'd think
you were doing very good.

227
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,827
"Pretty, very." There's really no objective
scale for delineating variations of good.

228
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,120
Why do you ask?

229
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:55,124
Well, a little bird told me that
you and Leslie hooked up last night.

230
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,796
- Sheldon!
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: I'm coming.

231
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,549
So is it serious? Do you like her?

232
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,634
I don't...

233
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,681
That's really two different questions.
I'm not...

234
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,599
Sheldon, we have to go.

235
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:16,104
Boy, you're wound awfully tight
for a man who just had sexual intercourse.

236
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,568
All right, well, I'll talk to you later.
But I am so happy for you, Leonard.

237
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,445
Thank you.

238
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,781
<font color="#E86CE4">(DOOR CLOSES)</font>

239
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,951
What did she mean, she's happy for me?

240
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,746
Is she happy because I'm seeing someone
or because she thinks I'm happy?

241
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,958
Because anyone who cared for someone
would want them to be happy...

242
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,795
...even if the reason for their happiness
made the first person unhappy.

243
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,339
You know, because the second person,
though happy...

244
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,885
...is now romantically unavailable
to the first person.

245
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,556
Do you realize I may have to share
a Nobel Prize with your booty call?

246
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,269
You know what?

247
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,021
I'm being ridiculous.

248
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,565
But who cares what Penny thinks?

249
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,902
Leslie is a terrific girl.
She's attractive. We like each other.

250
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,653
She's extremely intelligent.

251
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,698
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: She's not that intelligent.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: She fixed your equation.

252
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,159
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: She got lucky.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: You don't believe in luck.

253
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,828
I don't have to believe in it
for her to be lucky.

254
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,332
Regardless, I have a chance
at a real relationship with Leslie.

255
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,668
I'm not gonna pass that up for
some hypothetical future happiness...

256
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,838
...with a woman who may
or may not want me to be happy...

257
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,425
...with the woman
who is currently making me happy.

258
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,344
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: Leonard.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Yeah?

259
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,721
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
I still don't care.

260
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,189
Hey, Leslie.

261
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,817
Careful, Leonard. Liquid nitrogen,
320 degrees below zero.

262
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,946
Brrrr. Heh.

263
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,995
Why are you smashing
a flash-frozen banana?

264
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,207
Because I got a bowl of Cheerios
and I couldn't find a knife.

265
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,421
So anyway, hello.

266
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,217
What are you doing?

267
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,636
Just extending the intimacy.

268
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,138
Hey, do you wanna slip over
to the radiation lab...

269
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,141
...and share a decontamination shower?

270
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,273
Okay, what exactly do you think's
going on between us?

271
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:29,404
I'm not sure, but I think I'm about
to discover how the banana felt.

272
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:37,537
Neither of us are neuroscientists, but we
both understand the biochemistry of sex.

273
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,124
Dopamine in our brains is released
across synapses, causing pleasure.

274
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,085
Stick electrodes in a rat's brain,
give him an orgasm button.

275
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,963
He'll push that thing
until he starves to death.

276
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,007
Well, who wouldn't? Heh.

277
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,050
The difference between us and the rat...

278
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,761
...is you can't stick an electrode
in our hypothalamus.

279
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,430
That's where you come in.

280
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,435
Yeah, well,
I'm just glad to be a part of it. Heh.

281
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,812
So, what happens now?

282
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,733
Well, I don't know about your sex drive,
but I'm probably good till New Year's.

283
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,777
Oh.

284
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,571
Okay.

285
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,407
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

286
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,371
- You wanna make plans for New Year's?
- Please, you're smothering me.

287
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,415
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

288
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,002
Hey, look. It's Dr. Stud.

289
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,296
Doctor what?

290
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,132
The blogosphere is abuzzing
with news of you and Leslie...

291
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,427
...making the bang, bang music.

292
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,806
- Well, how did it get on the Internet?
- I put it there.

293
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,017
Well, how did you know about it?

294
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,852
A little bird told us.

295
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,814
Apparently, you are a magnificent beast.

296
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,819
Well, that part's true.

297
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,701
I think I may have
misjudged this restaurant.

298
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,995
- No kidding.
- I don't wanna go out on a limb...

299
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,373
...but I think we may be looking
at my new Tuesday hamburger.

300
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,836
Your old Tuesday hamburger
will be so brokenhearted.

301
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,713
Way ahead of you.

302
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:15,426
I was thinking of moving Big Boy to
Thursdays and just dropping Souplantation.

303
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,428
- Really?
- Yeah.

304
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,848
The name always confused me, anyway.
Souplantation.

305
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,850
You can't grow soup.

306
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,773
- So how's everything?
- Terrific.

307
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,944
You'll be happy to know I plan to come
every Tuesday for the foreseeable future.

308
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,030
Really? Oh, yay. Heh.

309
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,700
Who do I speak to about
permanently reserving this table?

310
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,204
I don't know, a psychiatrist?

311
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,040
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
So, hey.

312
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,585
- How are things with you and Leslie?
- Oh.

313
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,463
To be honest,
I don't think it's going to work out.

314
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,509
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, hey, don't worry.

315
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,138
I'm sure there's someone out there
who's just right for you.

316
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,643
Well, what did she mean by that?

317
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:10,231
Was that just a generic platitude
or was that a subtle bid for attention?

318
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,653
You know why this hamburger
surpasses the Big Boy?

319
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,990
This is a single-decker,
whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.

320
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,244
This has a much more satisfying
meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.

321
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,581
- Are you even listening to me?
- Of course I'm listening.

322
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:30,418
Blah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion,
blah, blah, blah.

323
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,046
Okay, then.

324
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,759
You know, you can grow
the ingredients for soup.

1
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,051
Okay, if no one else will say it, I will.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,721
We really suck at paintball.

3
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,807
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>:
That was absolutely humiliating.

4
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,977
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Oh, come on. Some battles
you win, some battles you lose.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:25,524
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: Yes, but you don't have to lose
to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah party.

6
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:31,405
I think we have to acknowledge, those were
some fairly savage preadolescent Jews.

7
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,868
No, we were annihilated
by our own incompetence...

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,121
...and the inability of some people
to follow the chain of command.

9
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,622
Sheldon, let it go.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,044
No, I wanna talk about the fact
that Wolowitz shot me in the back.

11
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,840
I shot you for a good reason.
You were leading us into disaster.

12
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,426
I was giving clear, concise orders.

13
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,011
You hid behind a tree yelling:

14
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,014
"Get the kid in the yarmulke!
Get the kid in the yarmulke!"

15
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,640
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Penny.

16
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,517
- Hello.
- Morning, ma'am.

17
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,562
So how was paintball?
Did you have fun?

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,649
Sure, if you consider being fragged
by your own troops fun.

19
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,653
You clear a space on your calendar.
There will be an inquiry.

20
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,405
Okay. Um...

21
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,408
I'm having a party on Saturday,
so if you're around, come by.

22
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,743
- A party?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,829
A boy-girl party?

24
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,249
There will be boys
and there will be girls...

25
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,001
...and it is a party, so...

26
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,129
Just a bunch of my friends,
have some beer, do a little dancing.

27
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,422
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,674
- I don't know, Penny...
- Thing is, we're not...

29
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,551
- We're really more of a...
- No.

30
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,138
But thanks.
Thanks for thinking of us.

31
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,932
Are you sure? It's Halloween.

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,475
A Halloween party?

33
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,060
As in costumes?

34
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,603
Well, yeah.

35
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,863
Is there a theme?

36
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,573
Um, yeah, Halloween.

37
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,244
Yes, but are the costumes random
or genre-specific?

38
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,539
As usual, I'm not following.

39

He's asking if we can come as anyone
from science fiction...

40
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,127
- ...fantasy...
- Sure.

41
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,586
- Comic books?
- Fine.

42
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,213
- Anime?
- Of course.

43
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,799
TV, film, D&D, manga.
Greek, Roman, Norse gods...

44
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,050
Anything you want.

45
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,095
Okay? Any costume you want.

46
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,806
Bye.

47
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,144

Oh, no.

55
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,283
See, this is why I wanted
to have a costume meeting.

56
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,785
We all have other costumes.
We can change.

57
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,872
Or we could walk right
behind each other all night.

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,750
It'll look like one person
going really fast.

59
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,258
No, no, no.

60
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,429
It's a boy-girl party,
this Flash runs solo.

61
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,599
Okay, how about this?
Nobody gets to be the Flash.

62
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,808
We all change. Agreed?

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,187
<font color="#808080">ALL</font>:
Agreed.

64
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,731
I call Frodo!

00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,149
<font color="#808080">ALL</font>:
Damn.

66
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,616
Hey.

67
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,538
Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck
in the door on the bus.

68
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,832
- You went with Thor?
- What?

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,877
Just because I'm Indian,
I can't be a Norse god?

70
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,005
No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian god.

71
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,465
That's racism.

72
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,219
I mean, look at Wolowitz. He's not English,
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

73
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,557
Sheldon is neither sound nor light,
but he's obviously the Doppler effect.

74
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,732
- I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.
- Really?

75
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,486
Because I saw Peter Pan
and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby.

76
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,866
She was a little bigger than you,
but it's basically the same look, man.

77
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,870
Sheldon, there's something
I wanna talk to you about before we go.

78
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,083
I don't care if anybody gets it,
I'm going as the Doppler effect.

79
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:58,005
- No, it's not that...
- If I have to, I can demonstrate: Vroom.

80
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,218
Terrific. Um...

81
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,263
This party is my first chance for Penny...

82
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,516
...to see me in the context
of her social group...

83
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,352
...and I need you not
to embarrass me tonight.

84
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,522
What exactly do you mean
by embarrass you?

85
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,695
For example, tonight, no one needs to know
that my middle name is Leakey.

86
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,864
But there's nothing embarrassing
about that.

87
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,242
Your father worked with Louis Leakey,
a great anthropologist.

88
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,953
It had nothing to do
with your bed-wetting.

89
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,416
All I'm saying is that this party
is the perfect opportunity...

90
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,627
...for Penny to see me
as a member of her peer group...

91
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,048
...a potential close friend
and perhaps more.

92
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,260
I don't wanna look like a dork.

93
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,439
Just a heads up, fellas,
if anyone gets lucky...

94
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,150
...I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver.

95
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,445
Oh, hey, guys.

96
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,155
Hey, sorry we're late.

97
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,157
Late? It's 7:05.

98
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,368
And you said the party starts at 7.

99
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:15,248
Yeah, I mean, when you start a party at 7,
no one shows up at, you know, 7.

100
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,417
It's 7:05.

101
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,961
Yes, yes, it is.

102
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,464
Okay, well, um, come on in.

103
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,100
What, are all the girls in the bathroom?

104
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,811
Probably, but in their own homes.

105
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,981
So, what time
does the costume parade start?

106
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,983
The parade?

107
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,986
Yeah, so the judges can give out
the prizes for best costume.

108
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,905
Most frightening, most authentic...

109
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,742
...most accurate visualization
of a scientific principle.

110
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,995
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry...

111
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:58,333
...but there aren't gonna be any parades
or judges or prizes.

112
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,045
This party is just going to suck.

113
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,006
No, come on, it's gonna be fun.
And you all look great.

114
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,051
I mean, look at you, Thor,
and, oh, Peter Pan.

115
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,303
That's so cute.

116
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,598
- Actually, Penny, he's Robin...
- I'm Peter Pan.

117
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,853
And I've got a handful of pixie dust
with your name on it.

118
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,564
No, you don't.

119
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,987
- Hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?
- Oh, he's the Doppler effect.

120
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,865
Yes, it's the apparent change
in the frequency of a wave...

121
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,743
...caused by relative motion between
the source of the wave and the observer.

122
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,291
Oh, sure, I see it now.
The Doppler effect.

123
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,003
All right, I gotta shower. You guys,
um, make yourselves comfortable.

124
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,046
Okay.

125
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,842

I'm confused.

132
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,951
If there's no costume parade,
what are we doing here?

133
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,705
We're socializing, meeting new people.

134
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,208
Telepathically?

00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,711

<font color="#808080">WOMAN</font>: Hi.

136
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,256
Penny is wearing the worst
Catwoman costume I've ever seen.

137
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,258
And that includes Halle Berry's.

138
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,261
She's not Catwoman.
She's just a generic cat.

139
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,305
And that's the kind
of sloppy costuming...

140
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,725
...which results
from a lack of rules and competition.

141

Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.

142
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:48,610
I believe it's time for me
to turn my head and cough.

- What is your move?
- I'm going to use the mirror technique.

144
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,992
She brushes her hair back, I brush mine.
She shrugs, I shrug.

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,663
Subconsciously, she's thinking,
"We're in sync. We belong together."

146
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,998
Where do you get this stuff?

147
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,001
You know, psychology journals,
Internet research.

148
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:09,130
And there's this great show on VH1
about how to pick up girls.

149
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,635
Oh, if only I had his confidence.

150

I have such difficulty
speaking to women...

151

...or around women,
or at times even effeminate men.

- Well, I actually might be able to help.
- How so?

But patterns emerge.

165

They have their own language,
if you will.

166
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,142
Go on.

167
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,645
Well, it seems that the newcomer
approaches the existing group...

...with the greeting,
"How wasted am I?"

- Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
- Yes, but I need a wingman.

00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,717
I still don't get it.

196
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,636
I'm the Doppler effect.

197
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,222
Okay, if that is some sort
of learning disability...

198
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,557
...I think it's very insensitive.

199
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,395
Why don't you just tell people
you're a zebra?

200
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,315
Why don't you just tell people
you're one of the seven dwarves?

201
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,608
Because I'm Frodo.

202
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,695
Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.

203
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,656
- Oh, no.
- What?

204
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,825
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

205
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,702
What do you suppose he's doing here?

206
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,080
Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

207
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,875
If he were any bigger,
he'd have moons orbiting him.

208
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,294
- Oh, snap.
- Ha-ha.

209
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,047
So I guess we'll be leaving now.

210
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,966
Why should we leave?

211
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,761
For all we know, he crashed the party
and Penny doesn't even want him here.

212
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,849
You have a backup hypothesis?

213
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,934
Maybe they just wanna be friends.

214
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:12,439
Or maybe she wants to be friends
and he wants something more.

215
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,357
Then he and I are on equal ground.

216
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,819
Yes, but you're much closer to it
than he is.

217
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,283
Look, if this was 15,000 years ago,
by virtue of his size and strength...

218
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,161
...Kurt would be entitled
to his choice of female partners.

219
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,330
And male partners, animal partners,
large primordial eggplants...

220
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,000
...pretty much
whatever tickled his fancy.

221
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,253
Yes, but our society
has undergone a paradigm shift.

222
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,674
In the information age, Sheldon,
you and I are the alpha males.

223
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,343
- And we shouldn't have to back down.
- True.

224
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,680
Why don't you text him that
and see if he backs down?

225
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,016
No.

226
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,103
I'm going to assert
my dominance face to face.

227
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,354
Face to face?

228
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:57,192
Are you gonna wait for him to sit down
or you gonna stand on the coffee table?

229
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,445
Hello, Penny. Hello, Kurt.

230
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,405
Oh, hey, guys.
You having a good time?

231
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,199
Given the reaction to my costume...

232
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,203
...this party is a scathing indictment
of the American education system.

233
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,288
What? You're a zebra, right?

234
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,875
Yet another child left behind.

235
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,711
And what are you supposed to be,
an elf?

236
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,087
No, I'm a hobbit.

237
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,547
What's the difference?

238
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,717
A hobbit is a mortal, halfling inhabitant
of Middle-earth...

239
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,012
...whereas an elf
is an immortal, tall warrior.

240
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,057
So why the hell
would you wanna be a hobbit?

241
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,520
Because he's neither tall nor immortal,
and none of us could be the Flash.

242
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:38,775
Well, whatever. Why don't you go hop off
on a quest? I'm talking to Penny here.

243
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,902
I think we're all talking to Penny here.

244
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,445
I'm not. No offense.

245
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,198
Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.

246
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,408
- Go away.
- All right, Kurt, be nice.

247
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,161
Oh, I am being nice.

248
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,121
Right, little buddy?

249
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,415
- Kurt.
- Okay.

250
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,419
I understand your impulse
to try to physically intimidate me.

251
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,047
You can't compete with me
on an intellectual level...

252
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,008
...and so you're driven
to animalistic puffery.

253
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,427
You calling me a puffy animal?

254
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,720
Oh, of course not.

255
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,223
No, he's not. You're not, right, Leonard?

256
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,351
No, I said animalistic.

257
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,019
Of course, we're all animals...

258
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,565
...but some of us have climbed
a little higher on the evolutionary tree.

259
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,900
If he understands that, you're in trouble.

260
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,944
So what? I'm unevolved?

261
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,362
You're in trouble.

262
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,616
You know, you use a lot of big words
for such a little dwarf.

263
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,826
Okay, Kurt, please.

264
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,286
Look, Penny, it's okay.

265
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,704
I can handle this.

266
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,624
I am not a dwarf, I'm a hobbit.

267
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,834
A hobbit.

268
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,254
Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus
preventing the conversion...

269
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,256
...from short-term to long-term memory?

271
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,886
Okay, now you're starting
to make me mad.

272
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,891
A Homo habilis discovering
his opposable thumbs says, "What?"

273
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,268
- What?
- Ha-ha.

274
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,190
I think I've made my point.

275
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,360
Yeah? How about I make a point
out of your pointy little head?

276
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:08,489
Let me remind you, while my moral support
is absolute, in a physical confrontation...

277
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,325
...I will be less than useless.

278
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,452
There's not going to be a confrontation.

279
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,539
In fact, I doubt
if he can even spell confrontation.

280
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,377
C-O-N...

281
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,546
Frontation.

282
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,050
- Kurt, put him down this instant.
- He started it.

283
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,094
I don't care, I'm finishing it.
Put him down.

284
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,846
Fine.

285
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,934
You're one lucky little leprechaun.

286
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,020
He's a hobbit.

287
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,022
I got your back.

288
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,066
Leonard, are you okay?

289
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,068
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

290
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,445
I can't afford you

291
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,449
It's a good party. Thanks for having...
It's just getting a little late, so...

292
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:55,119
Oh. Okay. All right.
Well, thank you for coming.

293
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,247
I had nothing to do with

294
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,624
Happy Halloween.

295
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,712
If it's any consolation...

296
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,508
...I thought that Homo habilis line
really put him in his place.

297
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,019
- What's that?
- Tea.

298

When people are upset...

299
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,316
...the cultural convention
is to bring them hot beverages.

- No.
- Good.

00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,625
"There, there" was really all I had.

00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,101
I'm fine.

I am so sorry about what happened.

310

It's not your fault.

311
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,942
Yes, it is.
That's why I broke up with him.

312
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,695
He always does stuff like that.

313
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,948
So why was he at your party?

314
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,619
Well, I ran into him last week...

315
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,248
...and he was just all apologetic
about how he's changed.

316
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,501
He was just going on and on,
and I believed him.

317
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,838
And I'm an idiot,
because I always believe guys like that.

318
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,050
And I can't go back to my party
because he's there.

319

upset and really drunk and I just wanna...

- Penny?
- Yeah?

Are you sure that your being drunk
and your being angry with Kurt...

...can we get on with "Halo" night?

We were supposed to start at 8.
It's now 8:06.

15
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,634
So we'll start now.

16
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,887
We have to decide
if those lost six minutes...

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,973
...will come out of game time,
bathroom time or the pizza break.

18
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,933
We could split it two, two and two.

00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,145
If we're having anchovies on the pizza,
we can't take it out of bathroom time.

- Hey, guys.

See a Penny, pick her up,

No, you won't. Uh...

- Can I hide out here for a while?
- Sure. What's going on?

26
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,458
Well, there's this girl I know
from back in Nebraska, Christy.

27
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,169
She called me up,
she's like, "Hey, how's California?"

28
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,671
And I'm like, "Awesome,"
because it's not Nebraska.

29
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,716
The next thing I know,
she's invited herself to stay with me.

30
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,594
- Eight oh eight.
- Shh.

31
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,972
She got here today
and she's just been in my apartment...

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,227
...yakking about every guy she slept with
in Omaha, which is every guy in Omaha...

33
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,938
...and washing
the sluttiest collection of underwear...

34
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,023
...you have ever seen
in my bathroom sink.

35
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,443
Is she doing it one thong at a time
or does she throw it all in?

36
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,363
Like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?

37
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,450
- He really needs to dial it down.
- I know.

38
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,913
So if you don't like this Christy,
why are you letting her stay?

39
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,958
She was engaged to my cousin
while sleeping with my brother...

40
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,417
...so she's kind of family.

41
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,213
Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst.

42
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,257
Who needs "Halo"
when we can be regaled...

43
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,468
...with the delightfully folksy tale
of the whore of Omaha?

44
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,471
Oh... I don't think she's a whore.

45
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,265
No, yeah, she's definitely a whore.

46
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,851

it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo."

Okay, fine. We'll just play one-on-one
until he gets back.

One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one.

We play teams, not one-on-one.
One-on-one.

59
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:29,333
Well, the only way we can play teams
at this point is if we cut Raj in half.

60
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,587
Sure, cut the foreigner in half.
There's a billion more where he came from.

Relativity was a great idea.

Well, our earthquake supplies.

- We have a two-man, two-day kit.
- So?

So if there's an earthquake
and the three of us are trapped here...

129
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,534
...we could be out of food
by tomorrow afternoon.

130
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,412
Are you suggesting
that if we let Penny stay...

131
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,705
...we might succumb to cannibalism?

132
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,750
No one ever thinks it'll happen
until it does.

133
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:04,881
Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh
off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.

134
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:10,178

- He's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.

It's the fallacy of extending someone's
argument to ridiculous proportions...

...and then criticizing the result.
And I don't appreciate it.

Okay, since I'm obviously being ignored
here, let's go over the morning schedule.

139
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,447
I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20.

140
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,074
Plan your ablutions
and bodily functions accordingly.

141
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,870
How am I supposed to
plan my bodily functions?

142
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,289
I suggest no liquids after 11p.m.

143
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,959
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Leonard.

144

Heh, wrong.

145
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,966
I'm listening.

146
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,093
Your head goes on the other end.

147
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,262
- Why?
- It's culturally universal.

148
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,222
A bed, even a temporary bed...

149
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,142
...is always oriented with the headboard
away from the door.

150
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,063
It serves the ancient imperative
of protecting oneself against marauders.

151
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,902
- I'll risk it.
- Ooh.

152
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,445
Anything else I should know?

153
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,574
Yes. If you use my toothbrush,
I'll jump out that window.

154
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,912
Please don't come to my funeral.
Have a good night.

155
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,583
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

156
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:26,129
FYI, his toothbrush is the red one
in the Plexiglas case under the UV light.

157
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,716

- Well, sleep tight.

159
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,432
Funny expression, sleep tight. Ha-ha. Ha.

160
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,019
It refers to
the early construction of beds...

161
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,981

on interlocking ropes, which occasionally...

162

164
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,859

...poured a bowl of cereal,
added a quarter cup of milk...

166

...sat on this end of this couch, turned on
BBC America, and watched Doctor Who.

172
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:35,008
Because I am neither an invalid
nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.

173
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,178
What time is it?

174
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,138
Almost 6:30.

175
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,265
I slept all day?

176
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,726
No, it's 6:30 in the morning.

177
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,896
What the hell is your problem?

178
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,566
Okay, this cereal
has lost all its molecular integrity.

179
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,569
I now have a bowl
of shredded wheat paste.

180
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,239
Hola, nerd-migos.

181
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,786
Why do you people hate sleep?

182
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,538
Are you wearing my robe?

183
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,167
Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'll have it cleaned.

184
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,670
That's okay, keep it.

185
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,881
- Where's Christy?
- In the shower.

186
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,384
By the way,
where did you get that loofah mitt?

187
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,136
Yours reaches places
that mine just won't.

188
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,518
You used my loofah?

189
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,104
More precisely, we used your loofah.

190
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,898
I exfoliated her brains out.

191
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,985
You can keep that too.

192
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:40,657
Ah. Well, then, we'll probably need to talk
about your stuffed-bear collection.

193
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,244
<font color="#808080">CHRISTY</font>: Howard?
- In here, milady.

194
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:49,082
Mm. There's my little engine that could.

<font color="#E86CE4">(IMITATING TRAIN)</font>

196
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,589
There's one beloved children's book
I'll never read again.

197
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,175
Hi. Christy.

198
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,969
- Hey, Leonard.
- I'm Sheldon.

199
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,346
Right. You're Howard's entourage.

200
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,767
So, Christy, what are your plans?

201
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,354
Well, Howard said he'd take me shopping
in Beverly Hills.

202
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:15,233
Yeah, no, I meant plans to find
someplace to live other than with me.

203
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,361
Not that I don't love having you,
but it's a little crowded.

204
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,613
Penny, you're always welcome
to stay with us.

205
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,825
Oh, terrific.
Now we're running a cute little B & B.

206
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,453
Let me offer a little thinking here.

207
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,748
- Why doesn't Christy stay with me?
- You live with your mother.

208
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,584
I do not. My mother lives with me.

209
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,297
It's settled. Christy will stay with Howard,
Penny can go back to her apartment.

210
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,883
And I'll watch the last 24 minutes
of Doctor Who...

211
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,136
...although at this point,
it's more like Doctor Why Bother?

212
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,849
- Sheldon, you just can't dictate...
- No more talking. Everybody go.

213
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,437
So, what do you say?
Wanna repair to Casa Wolowitz?

214
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,148
What is that, like a Mexican deli?

215
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,525
I'm sorry,
I should have mentioned this earlier.

216
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,402
My last name is Wolowitz.

217
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,155
Oh. That's so cool.

218
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,699
My first Jew.

219
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,247
I imagine there aren't
very many kosher cornhuskers.

220
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,294
- But you're still taking me shopping?
- Anything you want.

221
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,797
Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.

222
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,928
When they perfect human cloning,
I'm gonna order 12 of those.

223
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,765
Howard, can't you see she's using you?

224
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,227
Who cares? Last night,
she pulled off her blouse and I wept.

225
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,062
Look, Howard, I know her, okay?

226
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,649
She'll have sex with anyone
as long as they keep buying her things.

227
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,526
- Really?
- Yeah.

228
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,069
Yay.

229
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:48,159
If you'll excuse me,
I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.

230
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,837
I'm sorry,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

231
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,923
We can't order Chinese food
without Wolowitz?

232
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,383
Let me walk you through it.

233
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,261
Our standard order is,
the steamed dumpling appetizer...

234
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,555
...General Tso's chicken,
beef with broccoli...

235
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,099
...shrimp with lobster sauce,
and vegetable lo mein.

236
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,184
Do you see the problem?

237
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,604
I see a problem.

238
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,400
Our entire order is predicated
on four dumplings and four entrées...

239
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,069
...divided amongst four people.

240
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,073
So we'll just order three entrées.

241
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,825
Fine. What do you wanna eliminate?

242
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,911
- And who gets the extra dumpling?
- We could cut it into thirds.

243
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,538
Then it's no longer a dumpling.

244
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,500
Once you cut it open, it is, at best,
a very small open-faced sandwich.

245
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,252
Hi, fellas.

246
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,048
Oh. Where's your annoying little friend
who thinks he speaks Mandarin?

247
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,634
He's putting his needs
ahead of the collective good.

248
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,178
Where he comes from,
that's punishable by death.

249
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,557
I come from Sacramento.

250
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,897
Can we get an order of dumplings,
but with three instead of four?

251
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,607
No substitutions.

252
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,151
This isn't a substitution.
It's a reduction.

253
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,737
Okay. No reductions.

254
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,990
Fine. Bring us three orders of dumplings.

255
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,618
- That's 12, we'll each have four.
- That works.

256
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,287
If we fill up on dumplings,
we need to eliminate an entrée.

257
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,663
No eliminations.

258
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,500
If we have extra,
we'll just take the leftovers home.

259
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:23,296
And divide it how? I'm telling you,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

260
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,923
Wolowitz is with his girlfriend.

261
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,675
If you'd let me invite Penny,
you would've had your fourth.

262
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,552
Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food?

263
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,013
She uses a fork
and she double-dips her egg rolls.

264
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,892
- We don't order egg rolls.
- Exactly. But we'd have to if she was here.

265
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,518
Can we please make a decision?

266
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:42,106
Not only are there children starving in
India, there's an Indian starving right here.

267
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,693
There's an idea.
Why don't we go out for Indian food?

268
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,612
Oh, ew.

269
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,530
You're nice boys.

270
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,992
Tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna bring you the four dumplings.

271
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,869
When I'm walking over to the table...

272
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,914
...maybe I get bumped,
one of the dumplings fall to the floor.

273
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,123
No one has to know.

274
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,085
I'll know.

276
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,551
- How about soup?
- Yeah, we can always divide soup.

277
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,220
What about the won tons?

278
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,228
Oh. Hey, guys, what's up?

279
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,397
It's "Halo" night.

280
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,649
Yeah? Okay.

281
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,860
So?

282
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,364
With Wolowitz spending all of his time
with your friend Christy...

283
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,535
She's not my friend. Friends do not
get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.

284
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,331
Right, anyway, uh,
with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere...

285
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,917
...we had something
we wanted to ask you.

286
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,003
- Sheldon?
- Yes. Ahem.

287
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,800
Penny,
we would very much appreciate it...

288
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,594
...if you would be the fourth member
of our "Halo" team.

289
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,433
I don't think I need to tell you
what an honor this is.

290
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,020
Oh. That's so sweet.

291
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,230
But I'm going out dancing
with a girlfriend.

292
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,691
You can't go out, it's "Halo" night.

293
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,235
Well, for Penny, it's dancing night.

294
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,362
- You go dancing every Wednesday?
- No.

295
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,822
Then it's not dancing night.

296
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,325
Why don't I play with you tomorrow?

297
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,954
Tonight is "Halo" night.
It's like talking to a wall.

298
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,500
All right, now, Sheldon,
you and I are about to have a problem.

299
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,421
Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.

300
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,340
Yes, but you didn't portray her
as completely irrational.

301
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,801
All right, fellas, I gotta go.

302
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,054
But good luck.

303
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,435
Maybe we should've asked if we could go
dancing with her and her girlfriend.

304
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,812
Okay, assuming we could dance,
which we can't...

305
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,856
...there are three of us and two of them.

306
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:51,319
- So?
- It's the Chinese restaurant all over again.

307
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,489
I assure you that cutting
a dumpling in thirds is child's play...

308
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:58,910
...compared with three men each attempting
to dance with 67 percent of a woman.

309
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,539
For God's sakes, Sheldon,
you are driving me crazy.

310
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,042
Your anger is not with me,
but with mathematics.

311
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,960
I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.

312
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,838
What is happening to us?
We're falling apart.

313
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,009
- Who are you calling?
- The only man who can restore...

314
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,678
...any semblance of balance
to our universe.

321
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,531
Sheldon, think this through.

322
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,700
You're going to ask Howard
to choose between sex and "Halo."

323
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,538
No, I'm going to ask him
to choose between sex and "Halo 3."

324
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,124
As far as I know,
sex has not been upgraded...

325
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,460
...to include hi-def graphics
and enhanced weapon systems.

326
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,256
You're right, all sex has is nudity,
orgasms and human contact.

327
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,383
My point.

328
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,595

00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,494
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, hey.

129
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,703
I need guinea pigs.

130
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:58,333
Okay, there's a lab animal supply
company in Reseda you could try.

131
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,295
But if your research is going to have
human applications, I suggest white mice.

132
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,507
Their brain chemistry
is far closer to ours.

133
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:10,178
I swear to God, Sheldon, one day,
I'm gonna get the hang of talking to you.

134
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,849
His mom's been saying that for years.

135
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,520
- What's up?
- Well, I convinced the restaurant...

136
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,898
...to give me a bartending shift
so I need to practice mixing drinks.

137
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:26,194
Oh, well, great. The key to acquiring
proficiency in any task is repetition.

138
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,988
With certain obvious exceptions.

139
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,867
Suicide, for example.

140
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,495
So, Leonard, how about it?

141
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:40,500
Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj
is going through some stuff right now.

142
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,211
And besides, he doesn't drink, so...

143
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,838
<font color="#E86CE4">(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)</font>

144
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,381
Really?

145
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,508
Um...

146
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:53,555
Raj is going through some stuff right now
and he'd like to take up drinking.

147
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,518
Okay, here you go, Leonard.
One Tequila Sunrise.

148
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,769
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

149
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,690
This drink is an example of how liquids
with different specific gravities...

150
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,234
...interact in a cylindrical container.

151
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,779
Thank you.

152
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,740
Okay, Raj, what'll it be?

153
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,534
<font color="#E86CE4">(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)</font>

154
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,869
Whatever you recommend.

155
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,372
How about a Grasshopper?
I make a mean Grasshopper.

156
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,707
Okay? Good, coming up.

157
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,878
- Sheldon, what are you gonna have?
- I'll have a Diet Coke.

158
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,257
Okay, can you please order a cocktail?
I need to practice mixing drinks.

159
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,928
Fine. I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.

160
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,098
That's rum and Coke without the rum.

161
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,767
Yes.

162
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,102
So Coke.

163
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,729
Yes.

164
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,565
And would you make it diet?

165
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,905
There's a can in the fridge.

166
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,493
A Cuba Libre traditionally comes
in a tall glass with a lime wedge.

167
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,787
Then swim to Cuba.

168
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,083
Bartenders are supposed
to have people skills.

169
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,963
Okay. Raj, here you go.

170
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,464
All right. Who's next?

171
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,384
I'd like to try a Slippery Nipple.

172
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,182
Okay, you're cut off.

173
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,185
Anybody need a refill?

174
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,145
Where did my life go, Penny?

175
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,317
One day I'm a bachelor,
and the next I'm married...

176
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,863
...and driving a minivan to peewee cricket
matches in suburban New Delhi.

177
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,200
Are you talking to me?

178
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,995
Is there another Penny here?

179
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,665
I had such plans. I had dreams.

180
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,210
I was going to be the Indira Gandhi
of particle astrophysics.

181
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,588
But with a penis, of course.

182
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,549
It's amazing.

183
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,175
Ever since I was a little boy...

184
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,220
...my father wanted me
to be a gynecologist like him.

185
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,349
How can I be a gynecologist?
I can barely look a woman in the eye.

186
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,189
You know what? I'm not going
to let my parents control my future.

187
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,816
It's time for a showdown.

188
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,110
Somebody give me a computer
with a Webcam.

189
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,364
Okay. Sweetie, I think
that's the Grasshopper talking.

190
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,033
It's about to tell my parents...

191
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,536
...that I'm not riding an elephant
down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.

192
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,622
Okay, calm down.

193
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,999
No one can make you get married.

194
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,585
Why don't you meet this girl,
see what happens?

195
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,338
Haven't you been listening?
I cannot talk to women.

196
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,758
- Raj...
- No, no, let's see how long it takes him.

197
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,385
Raj, honey...

198
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,014
...you say you can't talk to women
but you've been talking to me.

199
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,350
And now we'll never know.

200
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,728
You're right. I...

201
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,355
I am talking to you.

202
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,900
Hello, Penny. How are you?

203
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,610
I'm fine.

204
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,071
Okay, now, I need to
make sure I have a Lalita...

205
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,239
...before I meet the Grasshopper.

206
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,204
It's a sweet green miracle.

207
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,707
If you're gonna drink on this date,
just promise me you won't overdo it.

208
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,417
Overdo what?

209
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,378
Happiness?

210
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,088
Freedom?

211
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:18,760
This warm glow inside of me that promises
everything's going to be all hunky dunky?

212
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,470
Yeah, that.

213
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,890
Why don't you bring her to my restaurant
so I can keep an eye on you?

214
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,684
Okay.

215
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,938
What's the plan? Let's say he meets her,
he likes her, they get married.

216
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,941
What's he gonna do,
stay drunk for the rest of his life?

217
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,360
It worked for my parents.

<font color="#E86CE4">(PLAYING SLOW MUSIC ON PIANO)</font>

219
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,583
I can't believe I'm sitting here
next to little Lalita Gupta.

220
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,627
Well, you are.

221
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,921
Little Lalita.

222
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,631
That's kind of fun to say.

223
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,968
Little Lalita, little Lalita, little Lalita.

224
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,637
- You should try it.
- Oh, it's okay.

225
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,308
You have lost so much weight.

226
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,980
That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat.

227
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,691
Do you remember?

228
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,318
- Yes, I do.
- Of course you do.

229
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,196
Who could forget being that fat?

230
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,574
Well, I've been trying.

231
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,035
- So you're a dental student?
- Hmm.

232
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:31,332
Mm! Are you aware that dentists
have an extremely high suicide rate?

233
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,670
Not as high as air traffic controllers,
but there are far more dentists...

234
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,507
...than air traffic controllers,
so in pure numbers, you're still winning.

235
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,593
Yay, me.

236
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,554
Do you have a drink
that'll make him less obnoxious?

237
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,682
Drinks do not work that way.

238
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,185
I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her.

239
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:54,105
The last girl my mom set me up with
had a mustache and a vestigial tail.

240
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,067
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?

241
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,820
Nothing. I just really didn't wanna come.

242
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,533
Virgin diet Cuba Libre, please.

243
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,662
- Okay.
- In a tall glass with a lime wedge.

244
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,874
Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.

245
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,211
So how's Koothrappali...?

246
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,670
Oh, my Lord.

247
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,673
- What?
- That's Princess Panchali.

248
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,717
I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.

249
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:27,055
No, no. Princess Panchali
from The Monkey and The Princess.

250
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:31,935
Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online
but they wanted my credit card.

251
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,437
It's a children's story.

252
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,564
Oh, no, it isn't.

253
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,487
When I was a little boy and got sick,
which was most of the time...

254
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,030
...my mother would read it.

255
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,242
It's about an Indian princess
who befriends a monkey...

256
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,411
...who was mocked by the other monkeys
because he was different.

257
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,748
For some reason,
I related to it quite strongly.

258
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,917
I know the reason.

259
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,045
We all know the reason.

260
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,589
Sheldon, what are you getting at?

261
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,593
That woman looks exactly like the pictures
of Princess Panchali in the book.

262
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,764
How often does one see a beloved
fictional character come to life?

263
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,433
Every year at Comic-Con.

264
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,185
Every day at Disneyland.

265
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,896
You can hire Snow White
to come to your house.

266
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,691
Of course, they prefer it if you have a kid.

267
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,569
Hey, guys. This is Lalita Gupta.

268
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:26,030
Lalita, this is Leonard and Sheldon
and Howard and Penny.

269
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,158
Isn’t it great? She isn't fat anymore.

270
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,077
Forgive me, Your Highness...

271
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,955
...for I am but a monkey
and it is in my nature to climb.

272
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,625
I did not mean to gaze upon you
as you comb your hair.

273
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,211
I'm sorry?

274
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,506
You are the living embodiment
of the beautiful Princess Panchali.

275
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,135
Oh, no kidding. Who is that?

276
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,888
A beloved character
from an Indian folktale.

277
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,681
Oh.

278
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,851
Us Indian
or "come to our casino" Indian?

279
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,479
- You Indian.
- Oh.

280
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,899
The resemblance is remarkable.

281
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,485
I can practically smell the lotus blossoms
woven into your ebony hair.

282
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,487
Well, thanks.

283
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,990
I imagine you smell very nice too.

284
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,994
I shower twice a day
and wash my hands as often as I can.

285
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,330
Really? So do I.

286
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,499
But you're a dentist, he's nuts.

287
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,753
Don't be insulting, Rajesh.

288
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,715
So, Sheldon, tell me more about
this princess you say I look like.

289
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,928
It was said that the gods
fashioned her eyes out of the stars...

290
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:34,098
...and that roses were ashamed to bloom
in the presence of her ruby lips.

291
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,017
Oh, my.

292
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,186
- Back off, Sheldon.
- What?

293
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,690
If you do not stop hitting on my lady,
you will feel the full extent of my wrath.

294
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,692
I'm not hitting on her.

295
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,402
And I am not your lady.

296

- You can't talk to me like that.

Luckily for you.
She could have you beheaded.

- I could eat.

00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,564
<font color="#808080">Okay, let me put it this way</font>: I'm doing it.

89
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,816
You can't. I'm the lead author.

90
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,778
Come on, the only reason you're the lead
author is because we went alphabetically.

91
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,864
I let you think we went alphabetically...

92
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,825
...to spare you dealing
with the fact that it was my idea.

93
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,495
Not to put too fine a point on it,
but I was throwing you a bone.

94
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,247
You're welcome.

95
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,834
Excuse me, I designed the experiment
that proved the hypothesis.

96
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,419
It doesn't need proving.

97
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,340
So the entire scientific community
is just supposed to just take your word?

98
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,259
They're not supposed to,
but they should.

99
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,635
I don't care what you say.

100
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,263
I'm going to the conference,
presenting our findings.

101
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,598
And I forbid it.

102
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,351
You forbid it?

103
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,395
If I'm not taking credit for our work,
then nobody is.

104
00:05:55,563 --> 00:06:00,150
- So you admit that it's our work?
- No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone.

105
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,944
And once again, you are welcome.

Oh, no, he didn't.

108
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,289
So how's it going with Sheldon?
Are you guys still not talking?

109
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,459
Not only is he still not talking to me,
but he does this thing...

110
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,629
...where he stares at you
and tries to get your brain to explode.

111
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,425
You know,
like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?

112
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,927
<font color="#808080">Like</font>: Bzz-phew!

113
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,721
Never mind.

114
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,057
How about this one?

115
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,227
It says, "I know my physics,
but I'm still a fun guy."

116
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,478
Oh.

117
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,523
Oh, I didn't know
they still made corduroy suits.

118
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,275
They don't. That's why I saved this one.

119
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,071
Okay, well,
let's just see what else you have.

120
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:51,284
Okay, here.
Take this and this and this...

121
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,912
- ...and these.
- Is this stuff you want me to try on?

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,790
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.

123
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,961
Seriously, don't even give it to charity.
You won't be helping anyone.

124
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,213
What's this?

125
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,841
That's the Bottle City of Kandor.

126
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,843
Uh-huh.

127
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,639
You see, Kandor was the capital city
of the planet Krypton.

128
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,475
It was miniaturized by Brainiac
before Krypton exploded...

129
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,436
...and then rescued by Superman.

130
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,064
Oh, nice.

131
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,359
It's a lot cooler
when girls aren't looking at it.

132
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,780
Here, why don't you put these on
while I find a shirt and sport coat?

133
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,616
- Great, be right back.
- Where are you going? Put them on.

134
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,619
- Here?
- Oh, are you shy?

135
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,038
- No, I'm not shy.
- Don't worry, I won't look.

136
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,542
I know you won't. Why would you look?
There's nothing to see. Not noth...

137
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,503
- Sweetie, put the pants on.
- I'm gonna put them on.

138
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,924
So, you know, isn't there some way
you and Sheldon could compromise...

139
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,509
...on this presentation thing?

140
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,387
No, no. Scientists do not compromise.

141
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,391
Our minds are trained to synthesize facts
and come to inarguable conclusions.

142
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,770
Not to mention,
Sheldon is bat-crap crazy.

143
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,399
What is this?

144
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,693
Oh, careful.

145
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,738
That's my original series
Battlestar Galactica flight suit.

146
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,074
Oh, why didn't you wear it
on Halloween?

147
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,328
Because it's not a costume.
It's a flight suit.

148
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,832
Okay, all right. Moving on.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,168
Oh, wow, a paisley shirt.

150
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,170
Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.

151
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,342
If you mean it should end up
in the same place, then I agree.

152
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,178
Is this your only tie?

153
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,138
Ah, technically, yes.

154
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:39,935
But if you'll notice, it's reversible.

155
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,896
So it works as two.

156
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,690
Oh, sweetie,
I don't even think it works as one.

157
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,071
- Is this all your clothes?
- Yup, everything since the eighth grade.

158
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,240
The eighth grade?

159
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,200
My last growth spurt.

160
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,621
Okay, well,
guess we're back to the corduroy suit.

161
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,957
- Great.
- Yup.

162
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,544
I said no. Put it down.

Hello, Penny.

of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.

168
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:27,399
Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.

169
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,446
It was a joke.

170
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,116
Heh-heh.

171
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,289
Yup. Tip your waitresses.
I'm here all week.

172
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,542
To save you from further awkwardness...

173
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,504
...know that I'm comfortable with
the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.

174
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,965
Oh, yeah, okay, me too. Zip it, lock it.

175
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,761
Put it in your pocket.

176
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,560
- So you and Leonard...
- Oh, dear God.

177
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,645
Little misunderstanding, huh?

178
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,230
A little misunderstand...?

179
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:11,318
Galileo and the pope
had a little misunderstanding.

180
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,281
Anyway, I was talking
to Leonard this morning...

181
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,700
...and I think he feels really bad about it.

182

<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:

183

184

I don't understand the question.

185
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,753
Well, I'm just asking if it's difficult
to be fighting with your best friend.

186
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,714
Oh, I hadn't thought about it like that.

187
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,925
I wonder if I've been experiencing
physiological manifestations...

188
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,429
...of some sort
of unconscious emotional turmoil.

You should just talk to him.
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

192
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,735
- It's certainly preferable to my plan.
- Which was?

193
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,071
A powerful laxative.

194
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,407
Okay, so you absolutely
should talk to him.

195
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,368
I know Leonard values you as a friend.

196
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,411
He told me without your little idea...

197
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,040
...there was no way he could've come up
with this whole experiment thing.

198
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,920
Excuse me. Little idea?

199
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,131
Yeah, he tried to explain it to me.
I didn't really understand it...

200
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,259
Of course you didn't.
He said "little idea"?

201
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,471
Oh. Well, no.
I mean, not in those words...

202
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,515
In what words, then, exactly?

203
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,183
The exact words aren't really...

204
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,727
- It's more the spirit in which...
- What did he say?

205
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,187
You had a lucky hunch.

206
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,358
I've been thinking.
Instead of arguing about this, why...?

207
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,069
Don't you ever speak to me again.

208
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,322
What...?

209
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,076
Oh, he:

210
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,881
Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.

211
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,219
- Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch."
- Sheldon, I didn't mean it like that.

212
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,012
- Why did you say it?
- I don't know...

213
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,974
- Were you trying to impress Penny?
- No, no, not at all.

214
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,642
A little bit.

215
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,978
How did that work out for you?

216

217
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,858
Libido, one. Truth, zero.

218
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,902
I'm gonna ask one more time.

219
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,780
We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.

220
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:25,869
And I'm telling you for the last time,
it's pandering, it's undignified, and bite me.

No, no, I didn't say better,
I said less stained.

228
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,234
I just checked the house.
There's probably 20, 25 people in there.

229
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,861
- You're kidding.
- Is that all?

230

I'm nervous.

00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:14,459
- It's okay. Open with a joke, you'll be fine.
- Okay, joke. Okay.

234
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,045
How about this? Um, okay.

235
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,381
There's this farmer,
and he has these chickens...

236
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,050
...but they won't lay any eggs.

237
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,886
So he calls a physicist to help.

238
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:30,099
The physicist then does some calculations
and he says:

239
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:35,897
"I have a solution, but it only works
for spherical chickens in a vacuum."

So in conclusion, the data show that at
temperatures approaching absolute zero...

247
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,759
...the moment of inertia changes
and the solid becomes a supersolid...

248

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,989
Any other questions?

254
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,702
Dr. Sheldon Cooper here.
I am the lead author of this particular paper.

255
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,414
Thank you.

256
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,126
And you, sir, you have completely
skipped over the part...

257
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,211
...where I was walking through
the park...

258
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,630
...and I saw these children
on a merry-go-round...

259
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,508
...which started me thinking
about the moment of inertia...

260
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,761
...in gasses like helium at temperatures
approaching absolute zero.

261
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,598
I didn't skip it.
It's just an anecdote. It's not science.

262
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,767
Oh, I see. It was the apple falling
on Newton's head.

263
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,185
Was that just an anecdote?

264
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,563
- You are not Isaac Newton.
- No, no, that's true.

265
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,482
Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.

266
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,234
You cannot be that arrogant.

267
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,029
You continue to underestimate me,
my good man.

268
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:10,158
If you weren't happy with my presentation,
then maybe you should've given it with me.

269
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,537
As I've explained repeatedly, unlike you,
I don't need validation from lesser minds.

270
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,040
- No offense.
- Really? So why did you come?

271
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,918
- Because I knew you'd screw this up.
- I didn't screw it up.

272
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,254
Oh, please. I admit,
that spherical-chicken joke was hilarious.

273
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,673
- Thank you.
- It was straight downhill from there.

274
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,800
I've had enough of your condescension.

275
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,678
Maybe I didn't go to college
when I was 11, like you.

276
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,182
Maybe I got my doctorate at 24
instead of 16.

277
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,353
But you are not the only person who
is smarter than everyone else in this room.

278
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,855
No offense.

279
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:45,026
And I am clearly not the only person
who is tormented by insecurity...

280
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,445
...and has an ego
in need of constant validation.

281
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,531
- So you admit you're an egotist.
- Yes.

282
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,619
My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
I could never please my parents...

283
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,038
...so I need to get my self-esteem
from strangers.

284
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,289
But he's worse!

285
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,999
Okay, that is it.

286
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,876
Stop it.

287
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,255
You cannot blow up my head
with your mind.

288
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,383
Then I'll settle for an aneurism.

289
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,301
- Stop it.
- You hit me.

00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,222

You're right. I'm the problem,

Well, that's not much of an apology,

Yes. Ahem.

I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.

312
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,789

"Singing is neither an appropriate vocation
nor avocation for you...

00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,234
I couldn't say that.

83
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,697
I would have to say, "You were terrific
and I can't wait to hear you sing again."

84
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,033
Why?

85
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,993
It's the social protocol.

86
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,202
It's what you do...

87
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,748
...when you have a friend who's proud
of something they really suck at.

88
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,208
I was not aware of that.

89
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,961
- Well, now you are.
- Oh, all right.

90
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,629
- Leonard?
- Yes?

91
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,675
When we played chess earlier, you were
terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.

92
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,385
Good night.

Leonard? Leonard?

96
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,356
This would be so much easier
if I were a violent sociopath.

Leonard? Leonard?

98
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,487
- What?
- I was analyzing our lie...

99
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,740
...and I believe we're in danger
of Penny seeing through the ruse.

100
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,117
- How?
- Simple.

101
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:14,456
If she were to log on to www.
socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other...

102
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,168
...click on upcoming events, scroll to
seminars, download the PDF schedule...

103
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,129
...and look for the seminar
on molecular positronium, then...

104
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:25,008
...bippity boppity boo,
our pants are metaphorically on fire.

105
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,058
Well, sir, my trousers
will not be igniting today.

00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,146
Penny?

108
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,940
Penny?

109
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,650
Good morning.

110
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,528
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- Of course I do.

111
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,490
My watch is linked to the atomic clock
in Boulder, Colorado.

112
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,118
It's accurate to one-tenth of a second.

113
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,495
As I'm saying this
it occurs to me once again...

114
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,206
...your question may
have been rhetorical.

115
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,833
What do you want?

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,293
Remember how Leonard told you
we couldn't come...

117
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,964
...because we were attending a symposium
on molecular positronium?

118
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,343
I remember symposium.

119
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,471
Yes, well, he lied.

120
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,723
Wait, what?

121
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,185
He lied, and I'm feeling
very uncomfortable about it.

122
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,396
Well, imagine how I'm feeling.

123
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,149
Hungry?

124
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,444
Tired?

125
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,321
I'm sorry, this really isn't my strong suit.

126
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,365
You told her I lied?

127
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,367
Why would you tell her I lied?

128
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,870
To help you.

129
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,372
I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.

130
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,875
She was going to see
through your lie eventually...

131
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,502
...so I told her that you were lying
to protect me.

<font color="#E86CE4">(LEONARD GROANS)</font>

133
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,506
Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.

134
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,383
Hunger?

135
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,218
Indigestion?

136
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,512
I'm sorry,
I'm really not very good at this.

137
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,640
Anyway, Penny now believes
that on Friday night...

138
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:00,479
...we're going to participate
in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.

139
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,647
Your cousin Leopold.

140
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,358
Whom most people call Leo,
but he also answers to Lee.

141
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,943
Remember that, it's important.

142
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,488
- What's important?
- Details, Leonard.

143
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,825
The success or failure
of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.

144
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,537
- Do you have a cousin Leopold?
- No, I made him up.

145
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,707
I think you'd call him Lee.

146
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,545
I don't get it. I already told her a lie,
why replace it with a different lie?

147
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,507
Well, first of all,
your lie was laughably transparent...

148
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,092
...where mine is exquisitely convoluted.

149
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:36,806
While you were sleeping,
I was weaving an un-unravelable web.

150
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,392
- Un-unravelable?
- Yes.

151
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,479
If she Googles Leopold Houston,
she'll find a Facebook page...

152
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,232
...an online blog
depicting his descent into drug use...

153
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,110
...and a desperate
yet hopeful listing on eHarmony.com.

154
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,782
Okay, why would I go
to a drug intervention for your cousin?

155
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,160
Ah! Because it's in Long Beach
and I don't drive.

156
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,788
We're going to Long Beach?

157
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,791
Of course not, there's no cousin Leo,
there's no intervention.

158
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,585
- Focus, Leonard.
- Oh, come on.

159
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,756
We just leave the house on Friday night
and return in the wee hours...

160
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,677
...emotionally wrung out from the work
of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.

161
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,345
So he goes back into rehab?

162
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:20,767
Yes, but he can relapse if Penny
ever invites us to hear her sing again.

163
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,812
You still told her I lied.

164
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,272
Yeah, for a noble purpose.

165
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:29,192
To spare me the social embarrassment
of having a drug-addled first cousin.

166
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,112
- Which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
- I don't know.

167
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,450
- How am I supposed to remember all this?
- That's the best part, you don't have to.

168
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,621
I told Penny that you would be embarrassed
if you knew she found out you had lied...

169
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,667
...so she's agreed to operate
as if the original lie is still in force.

170
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:53,300
So she's expecting me to lie
about going to a symposium in Pasadena...

171
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:58,471
...when in actuality, we're pretending to go
to a drug intervention in Long Beach.

172
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,473
Un-unravelable.

173
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,315
Oh, hey, Penny. Wow, look at you,
all ready for your showcase.

174
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,983
- You look great.
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Thanks.

177
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,992
- Well, thank you.
- You know, I gotta tell you.

178
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,370
A lot of friends would let their friend
go alone, but that's not you.

179
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,249
You are the kind of guy
who stands by a friend when...

180
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,336
When he has a symposium to go to.

181
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,716
I don't know what to say.

182
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,803
- It's okay, Leonard.
- Oh, okay, all right, good.

183
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,139
- Oh, boy, group hug.
- Uh-uh.

184
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,268
- Uh-uh?
- Okay. So, what's up?

185
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:49,564
Well, Penny is on her way to perform in
a one-night showcase production of Rent...

186
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,026
...which we are unable to attend,
because we're going to a symposium...

187
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:57,572
...on molecular positronium
given by Dr. Emil Farmanfarmian.

188
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,243
Wait a minute, Farmanfarmian is speaking
and you're bogarting the symposium?

189
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,914
- Howard, I'm sorry, we would've...
- No, no, you're quark-blocking us.

190
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,418
I don't know what to say.

191
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,961
Wow.

192
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,089
- Howard...
- It's your Millennium Falcon...

193
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,092
...you and Chewbacca do
whatever you wanna do.

194
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,930
Me and Princess Leia here will find
some other way to spend the evening.

195
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,765
Howard, wait.

196
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,976
Sheldon, I think we should tell them.

197
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,479
Okay, sure.

198
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,231
I don't see a problem with that.

199
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,567
There's no symposium.

200
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,820
Leonard lied to me.
Isn't that right, Leonard?

201
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,488
Well...

202
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,659
- I don't know what to say.
- It's okay, I do.

203
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,453
Look, Leonard is helping Sheldon
through a family crisis.

204
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:50,291
He made up the whole story about
the symposium with Dr. Farmanfarmian...

205
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,501
- Good for you.
- Ha! Yeah.

206
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:57,090
He didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

207
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,175
Every family in America has a relative...

208
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,470
...holed up in a garage somewhere
huffing paint thinner.

209
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,099
No, I'm lost too.
I think she skipped a step.

210
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:11,312
Now, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped
rehab and he's in a Motel 8 in Long Beach.

211
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,732
The whole family's going out
for an intervention.

212
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,609
Leonard is driving Sheldon down
to help him through this...

213
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,613
- ...because he's such a good man.
- Oh, another hug? Thank you.

214
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,576
- All right, you guys. Good luck.
- Thanks, Penny.

215
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,494
- Break a leg.
- Yeah, break a leg.

216
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,456
So road trip to Long Beach.

217
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,000
- We're not going to Long Beach.
- Why not?

218
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,211
Because Sheldon doesn't have
a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.

219
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,172
Oh, too bad.

220
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,175
I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.

221
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,136
It's a very nice community.
The Queen Mary is docked there.

222
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,681
Once the largest liner in the world,
it's now a hotel and restaurant...

223
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,851
...where they host a surprisingly gripping
murder-mystery dinner.

224
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,811
- Sounds fun.
- I'm game.

225
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,189
- Shotgun.
- No, no, no.

226
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,318
Leonard gets nauseous unless
he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.

227
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,531
Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?

Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?

230
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,084
Let it go, Sheldon.

231
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,546
The murderer was the first mate
whether it makes sense to you or not.

232
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,716
No, that's the least of our worries.

233
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,718
I've been doing research on addiction...

234
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,054
...both the biochemical
and behavioral aspects...

235
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,432
...and I think there's a problem
with the current version of our lie.

236
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,560
What are you talking about?
It's fine, she bought it, it's over.

237
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,691
Sadly, it's not.

238
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,735
Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle.

239
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,446
But beyond that,
I have realized the Leo I described...

240
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,367
- ...would not have agreed to go to rehab.
- Why not?

241
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,952
Because Leo's a middle child.

242
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,039
There's no Leo. How can you say that?

243
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,753
You didn't read the bio, did you?

244
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,006
He's not just a middle child,
he is the quintessential middle child.

245
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,884
From a broken home, to boot.
Psychologically speaking...

246
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,471
...the attention he gets by rebelling,
even to the point of destruction...

247
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,599
...is more emotionally valuable
than help he would get at rehab.

248
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,643
- I've got a solution.
- Great. What is it?

249
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,104
Get out.

250
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,439
Fine.

251
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,989
I've hesitated to point this out...

252
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,616
...but I must remind you
we are in our predicament...

253
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,077
...because of your initial
and inadequate deceit.

254
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,288
I'm just trying to clean up
after your mess.

255
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,544
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
We'll talk in the morning.

256
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,683
Morning.

257
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,643
Who are you?

258
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,021
I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.

259
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,607
Oh, God.

260
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,653
Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.

261
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,530
Au contraire.

262
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,990
I'm 26 years old...

263
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:14,495
...I'm originally from "Denton, Texas,"
but I was a Navy brat.

264
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,665
I was brought up on a variety
of military bases around the world.

265
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,252
As a result, I've often felt like an outsider,
never really fitting in...

266
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,880
...probably the reason
for my substance-abuse problem.

267
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,008
Excuse me, we just went over this.

268
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:31,638
As the middle child, your addiction
is rooted in your unmet need for attention.

269
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,557
Oh, Sheldon, are we really gonna go
with pop psychology?

270
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,560
For your information,
this is all based on solid research.

271
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,313
Just stick with the character profile
I wrote for you.

272
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,065
- Sheldon?
- I'm sorry.

273
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,816
Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld.

274
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,694
He's a research assistant
in the particle-physics lab...

275
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,031
...but he also minored in theater at MIT.

276
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,033
It was more of a double major, actually.

277
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,451
Theater and Physics.

278
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,537
You can guess which one
my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.

279
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,872
Yeah, I got it.

280
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,999
Sheldon, why?

281
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,710
You see, while Leo would not
have gone into rehab...

282
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,881
...it is completely plausible that we would
have talked him into leaving the motel...

283
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,217
- ...and coming home with us.
- Oh...

284
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,552
Sheldon, how about this
as my motivation?

285
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,887
When I was 14 years old...

286
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,100
...I was abused in the Philippines
by a clubfooted Navy chaplain.

287
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,063
No, we're going with middle child
and a genetic predisposition...

288
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,732
...to inadequate serotonin production.

289
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,694
Swell, well, how do I play
genetic predisposition?

290
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,030
Subtextually, of course.

293
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,626
- Morning, Penny.
- Hi. How did the intervention go?

294
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,713
Unfortunately, we weren't able
to convince him to go to rehab.

295
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,091
Well, based on what you told me,
I'm not surprised.

296
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,096
But we did convince him
to leave the motel.

297
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,264
Come say hello.

298
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,395
Leo, this is Penny,
our friend and neighbor.

299
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,773
Hi, Leo, how are you feeling?

300
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,613
Let me ask you something, Penny.

301
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,285
Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel
covered in your own vomit...

302
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,246
...next to a transsexual prostitute?

303
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,295
- No.
- Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.

304
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,840
Well, that's Leo.

305
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,303
Hey, why don't you tell me
about your showcase last night?

306
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,637
Oh, it was okay, I guess.

307
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,348
Wasn't a big turnout,
but they both seemed to like it.

308
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:44,312
- There were only two people there?
- By the end, yeah.

309
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,315
Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan.

310
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,693
I'm sorry?

311
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,820

312
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,741
1992.

313
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,826
The Subic Bay Naval Station.

314
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,996
A young boy on the cusp of manhood.

315
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:07,543
His only companions,
mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes.

316
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,047
Desperate and alone,
he reached out to a man...

317
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:15,343
...who promised to introduce him
to a merciful, loving God...

318
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:19,680
...but who instead introduced him
to a gin-pickled tongue...

319
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,684
...shoved down his adolescent throat.

320
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,187
What choice did he have...

321
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:32,193
...but to drink, shoot
and snort his pain away?

322
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,821
Don't forget genetic predisposition
towards addiction.

323
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,030
Never been proven.

324
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,574
- There have been studies.
- Not double-blind studies.

325
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,202
How could there be?
Who would be the control group?

326
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,454
As you can see,
detoxing can get pretty ugly.

327
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,706
- Let's give them some privacy.
- Yeah.

328
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,667
Do you wanna come over,
have coffee?

329
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,878
- Sounds good.
- I have a video of me singing last night.

330
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,880
Do you wanna see it?

331
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,675
- Gee, why wouldn't I?
- This is even better...

332
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,011
...than you coming to the showcase,
now I get to watch you watch me.

333
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,513
Yeah.

334
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,308
Funny how things work out.

335
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,061
But he loved the companionship
and the wisdom...

336
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,730
...that his own father failed to provide.

337
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,608
Your parents made the right decision.

338
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,159

347
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,956
He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard,
where is he going to go?

- Checkmate.
- Aaarggh!

- If you leave now, you can be back...

Unless Sheldon's there.

You'll be trapped forever
in his whiny, hyper-neurotic snot web.

Hi, Penny?

241
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,161
I was just wondering,
is Sheldon still at the restaurant?

242
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,248
Okay, that was very nice of you.
Okay, I gotta go.

243
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,710
Got kind of a full-blown
Chernobyl thing here. Gotta go, bye.

244
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,421
He's home. I'm screwed.

245
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,761
Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.

00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,472
How about Lasik?

247
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,601
- You want me to get eye surgery?
- Would you rather go back...

248
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,897
...and deal with Sheldon or have a stranger
carve out your corneas with a laser beam?

249
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,401
- Well?
- I'm thinking.

250
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,989
Okay, nice and cozy.

00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,451
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Wait.

00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,497
Will you please rub this on my chest?

253
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,500
Oh, Sheldon. Can't you do that yourself?

254
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,003
VapoRub makes my hands smell funny.

255
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,007
- But, Sheldon...
- Please, please, please.

256
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,930
I can't believe I'm doing this.

257
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,439
No, no. Counterclockwise,

I can't...

- Living room appears to be empty.
- Okay, he must be in his bedroom.

276
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:50,902
My spare glasses are in my bedroom,
on my dresser, next to my bat signal.

Wireless mini-cam
and Bluetooth headset.

00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,874
We'll be your eyes.

282
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,877
- Fine.
- One more thing.

283
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,590
This is a sub-sonic impact sensor.

284
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,967
If Sheldon gets out of bed
and starts to walk...

285
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,762
...this will register it
and send a signal to the laptop.

286
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,724
At that point, based on the geography of
the apartment and the speed of Sheldon...

287
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,436
...you'll have seven seconds to get out,
glasses or no glasses.

288
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,313
Won't my footsteps set it off?

289
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,857
No. You'll be on your hands and knees.

290
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,777
Now, you'll need to get the sensor
close to Sheldon's room.

291
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,571
How do I carry it
if I'm on my hands and knees?

- Now keep true.
- What?

295
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,919
- It means go straight.
- Then just say, "Go straight."

296
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,257
You don't say, "Go straight," when you're
giving bearings. You say, "Keep true."

297
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,634
All right.

298
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,806
I just hit my head.

299
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,350
Because you didn't keep true.

300
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,355
Okay, turn right.

00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,983

302
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,818
Angle your head to the right.

303
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,946
Now, a little more.

304
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,614
Little more.

305
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,659
That's it. Now just keep true.

306
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,291
All right, you're close enough
to Sheldon's room. Deploy the sensor.

307
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,294
Now turn it on.

308
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,005
- It wasn't on?
- No.

309
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,132
Then why did I have to crawl?

310

Oh, I guess you didn't.

311
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,848
Okay, it's on.

312
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,768
Good. From this point forward,
you will have to crawl.

313
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,063

Under the sink. Yellow Tupperware bowl.

Here's the problem with teleportation.

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,638
Lay it on me.

3
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,598
Assuming a device could be invented...

4
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:20,436
...which would identify the state of matter
of an individual in one location...

5
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,439
...and transmit that to a distant location
for reassembly...

6
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,858
...you wouldn't have
transported the individual...

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:31,155
...you would have destroyed him in one
location and re-created him in another.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,366
How about that.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,785
I would never use a transporter.

10
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,621
The original Sheldon
would have to be disintegrated...

11

...in order to create a new Sheldon.

12
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:47,087
Would the new Sheldon be in any way
an improvement on the old Sheldon?

13
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,299
No, he would be exactly the same.

- Graduate work, very impressive.
- And he's only 15 years old.

22
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:13,530
Not bad.
I myself started graduate school at 14.

23
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:17,201
Well, I lost a year while my family
was tunneling out of North Korea.

24
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,372
Advantage, Kim.

25
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,000

Let him see why we're the best

27
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,713
I know you're not.

28
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,217
You don't have an Open Science Grid
computer or a free electron laser.

29
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,969
The string theory research
being done is a dead end.

30
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,848
Excuse me, that is my research,
and it is by no means a dead end.

31

Well, obviously, you don't see it yet,
but trust me, you will.

32

We're in the process
of updating our equipment.

We welcome your input
on our research goals.

35
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,030
We agree to look the other way
if you use 20 percent...

...of the money you attract to smuggle
your grandfather out of Pyongyang.

38

- Make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

You can count on us. We're on it.

40

What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,880
I mean, the whole landscape
of false vacuums in string theory...

42

...could be as large
as 10 to the 500th power.

- Leonard.
- Ha.

62
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,969
- Yeah?
- Get him out.

63
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,848
Come, I'll show you the rec center.
They've got Nautilus equipment.

64
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,808
Do I look like I lift weights?

65
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,395
Not heavy ones.

66
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,441
It's startling you haven't considered
a Lorentz invariant or field theory approach.

67
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,985
You think I haven't considered it?

68
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,405
- You really think I haven't considered it?
- Have you considered it?

69
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,201
- Get him out, Leonard.
- Come on, Dennis.

70
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,162
I'll show you the radiation lab.

71
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,623
Wow. You won the Stevenson Award?

72
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,877
Yes. In fact,
I am the youngest person ever to win it.

73
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,380
Really? How old?

74
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,881
Fourteen and a half.

75
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,175
Mm. You were the youngest
ever to win it.

76
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,473
It's like looking
into an obnoxious mirror, isn't it?

77
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,439
Mm. This is really delicious, isn't it?

78
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,821
Still can't talk to me
unless you're drunk, huh?

79
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,951
Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.

80
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,579
Hey, I'm damaged too.

81
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,124
How about a hug for Howie?

82
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,502
Sure. Raj, hug Howard.

<font color="#E86CE4">(SHELDON SIGHS)</font>

84
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,216
Something you'd like to share?

85
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,636
A tale of woe perhaps?

86
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,471
Fifteen years old.

87
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,475
Dennis Kim is 15 years old
and he's already correcting my work.

88
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,521
Today, I went from being
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to...

89
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,106
You know, that other guy.

90
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,399
Antonio Salieri?

91
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,902
Oh, God,
now even you're smarter than me.

92
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:26,491
You know, you don't have so many friends
that you can afford to start insulting them.

93
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,494
Just eat, Sheldon. You'll feel better.

94
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,912
Why waste food?

95
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,457
When a cow goes dry,
they don't keep feeding it...

96
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,960
...they just take her out
and shoot her between the eyes.

97
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:41,173
I'm confused.
Did Sheldon stop giving milk?

98
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,633
You can't let this kid get to you.

99
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,262
You knew that someday, someone would
come along who's younger and smarter.

100
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,098
Yes, but I assumed
I would've been dead hundreds of years.

101
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,810
And that there'd be an asterisk by his name
because he'd be a cyborg.

102
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,482
So you got a little competition.
I really don't see what the big deal is.

103
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,778
Of course you don't.
You've never excelled at anything.

104
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,491
I don't understand, exactly how did
he get any friends in the first place?

105
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,619
We liked Leonard.

106
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,122
What are you gonna do, just give up?

107
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,378
Yes, it's what a rational person does
when his entire life's work is invalidated...

108
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,339
...by a postpubescent Asian wunderkind.

109
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:27,469
He ceases his fruitless efforts,
he donates his body to scientific research...

110
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,180
...and he waits to die.

111
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:36,228
I'm confused again. Is he waiting, or do
we get to shoot him between the eyes?

112
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,649
- Hey.
- Hey.

113
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,192
I've decided you're right.

114
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,528
- My career is not over.
- Great.

115
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,739
But since Dennis Kim
has rendered my research pointless...

116
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,367
...I just have to find
something else to focus on.

117
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,701
Great.

118
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,496
So I've decided
I'm going to collaborate with you.

119
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,209
Great.

120
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,211
So, what exactly is it you do?

121
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,299
I know you chatter on about it all the time,
but I've never really paid attention.

122
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,220
Right now, I'm designing an experiment
to study the soft component...

123
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,140
...of cosmic radiation at sea level,
but I don't need help.

124
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,350
Oh, sure you do.

125
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,478
Now see, what's this here in the schematic,
a laser array?

126
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,355
- Yes.
- Now, hmm...

127
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,736
What happens if you use argon lasers
instead of helium-neon?

128
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,239
- It would blow up.
- Are you sure?

129
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,242
- Pretty sure.
- "Pretty sure" is not very scientific.

130
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,204
Is this how you normally work?
Just hunches and guesses and stuff?

131
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,206
Okay.

132
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,418
I understand that you're going
through a bit of a career crisis.

133
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,422
You're searching for some other area
where you can feel valuable and productive.

134
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,133
But I need to tell you something,
and listen carefully.

135
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,595
- All right.
- Go away.

136
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:58,727
If you're concerned about sharing credit
with me, your name can go first... I'm going.

137
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,941
It's a small brown paper bag, Ma.

138
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,069
I'm looking at it right now.

139
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,908
Why would I make that up?
There's no Ding Dong in it.

140
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,955
How are two Ding Dongs tomorrow
gonna help me today?

141
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,502
So this is Engineering, huh?

142
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,795
I'll talk to you later.

143
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,715
Engineering,
where the noble semiskilled laborers...

144
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,760
...execute the vision
of those who think and dream.

145
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,013
Hello, Oompa Loompas of science.

146
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,392
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

147
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,811
I just came by to say hello.

148
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,648
For three years,
you've never come by to say hello.

149
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,317
Well, up until now,
I've had better things to do.

150
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,403
So, what are we making today?

151
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:54,783
A small payload support structure for
a European science experimental package...

152
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,495
- ...that's going up on the next space shuttle.
- Really? How does it work?

153
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,789
It will be attached to the payload bay...

154
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,543
...and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.

155
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,169
Aha.

156
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,130
So it's a shelf.

157
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,301
No, you don't understand.

158
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,763
During acceleration, it needs
to stay perfectly level and provide...

159
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,348
Yeah, okay, it's a shelf.

160
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,642
I notice you're using titanium.

161
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,144
Did you give any consideration
to carbon nanotubes?

162
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,273
They're lighter, cheaper
and have twice the tensile strength.

163
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,028
Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office
that says I have a master's in engineering.

164
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:36,032
And you also have a note from your mother
that says, "I love you, Bubula."

165
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,705
But neither of those is a cogent argument
for titanium over nanotubes.

166
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,707
- Sheldon.
- Yes?

167
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,042
Go away.

168
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,211
Did Leonard tell you to say that?

169
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,547
No, I thought of it all by myself.

170
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,594
Huh? Can't be a coincidence.

171
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,222
There must be some causal link
I'm missing.

172
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,603
Go away.

173
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,071
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Curiouser and curiouser.

174
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,579
- Is he here?
- If he were, I wouldn't be.

175
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,040
You know what he did?
He watched me work...

176
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:29,711
...and then started to design a simple piece
of software that could replace me.

177
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,130
Is that even possible?

178
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,174
As it turns out, yes.

179
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,470
- Something's gotta be done about him.
- Like what?

180
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,890
He'll never cope with the fact
that some 15-year-old is smarter...

181
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,767
...and more accomplished than he is.

182
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:48,563
What if something were to happen to him
so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?

183
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,567
Then our problem would be solved.

184
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,945
Hang on, are we talking about
murdering Dennis Kim?

185
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,115
I'm not saying no.

186
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,452
We don't have to go that far.
There are other means.

187
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,455
We can't send him back to North Korea.

188
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,873
He knows how to get out.

189
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,712
The only thing we need to do
is make this Kim kid lose his focus.

190
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,757
It won't happen. He is not interested
in anything but physics.

191
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,634
- What about biology?
- What?

192
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,804
You know, biology.

193
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,890
The one thing that can completely derail
a world-class mind.

194
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,101
- Howard, he's 15.
- Yeah, so?

195
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,061
When I was 15, I met Denise Palmeri...

196
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:32,315
...and my grade point average
fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.

197
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,775
She was sleeping with you?

198
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:38,863
No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking
about what it would be like if she did.

199
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,616
Oh, good, you're all here.

200
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:46,079
I've decided that if the three of you drop
whatever you're working on and join me...

201
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,792
...we could lick cold fusion
in less than a decade, 12 years tops.

202
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,003
Go away?

203
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,674
Hmm.

204
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,259
Could it be me?

205
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,514
Hey, guys, what's up?

206
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,143
We need a hot 15-year-old Asian girl
with a thing for smart guys.

207
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,687
- What?
- Howard, that's racist.

208
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,524
Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick.

209
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,324
It's possible
she may have misunderstood us.

00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,167
- Dr. Cooper. Oh, are we interrupting?
- No, no, please come in.

212
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,836
I think you'll appreciate this.
This is very exciting.

- What are you working on?
- Something remarkable.

214
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,676
Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize
in Physics have disappeared... Thank you.

215
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,263
...I've decided to refocus my efforts
and use my people skills...

216
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,931
...to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

217
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,559
Look, I'm going
to solve the Middle East crisis...

218
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:54,564
...by building an exact replica of Jerusalem
in the middle of the Mexican desert.

219
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,232
To what end?

220
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,820
You know, it's like the baseball movie.
"Build it and they will come."

221
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,614
Who will come?

222
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,657
The Jewish people.

223
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,075
What if they don't come?

224
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,077
We'll make it nice, put out a spread.

225
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,456
Okay, well, speaking of spreads...

226
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,542
...we're having a welcoming party
this afternoon for Mr. Kim...

227
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,588
- ...who's agreed to join us at the university.
- Of course he has.

228
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,801
The oracle told us little Neo was the one.

229
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,637
You can see the matrix, can't you?

230
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,558
Okay, well, obviously, you're very busy
with your, ah, um...

231
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,768
Come, Dennis.

232
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,524
You'll have to excuse Dr. Cooper.
He's been under a lot of, um...

233
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,859
He's nuts.

236
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,577
They'll come, they'll settle
And I'll win the prize

237
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,998
I don't understand your objections,
Professor Goldfarb.

238
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,794
Why wouldn't the Sonora Desert
make a perfectly good Promised Land?

239
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,088
Go away.

240
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,050
We could call it Nuevo Jerusalem.

241
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,386
Please go away.

242
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,639
Said Pharaoh to Moses.

243
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,892
Why are all these young women here?

244
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,894
It's Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

245
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,980
Really? I was not aware of that.

246
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,440
Oh, yes.
There was a very official e-mail...

247
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,235
...that was sent to everyone
whose files indicated...

248
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,238
...they had daughters
between the ages of 14 and 16.

249
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,614
Hmm.

250
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,825
- Smooth.
- Thank you.

251
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,121
There's the man of the hour.

252
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:38,126
So we have a socially awkward genius in
a room of attractive age-appropriate women.

253
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,044
All he has to do is hook up with one.

254
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,348
Anyone else see the flaw in this plan?

255
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,267
We need a social catalyst.

256
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,313
Like what?
We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.

257
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,440
- Or can we?
- No, we can't.

258
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,485
I don't think you mean we can't.
I think you mean we shouldn't.

259
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,322
Hey, Howard, you're a Jew.

260
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,700
If there was another Wailing Wall
exactly like the one in Jerusalem...

261
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,578
...but close to taco stands
and cheap prescription drugs...

262
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,413
...would you still wail at it?

263
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,834
Okay, it's definitely me.

264
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,505
We cannot leave this to chance.
Let's pick a girl...

265
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,883
...and figure out
how to get her with Dennis.

266
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,885
How about that one?

267
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,806
Uh-uh. I know the type. Cheerleader,
student council, goes out with jocks.

268
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,142
Won't look at anybody
in the gifted program.

269
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,020
If she does agree to go out,
it turns out to be a setup.

270
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:43,066
You're in your mom's car with your pants off
while the whole football team laughs.

271
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,073
- Are you crying?
- No, I have allergies.

272
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,408
Okay. Uh...

273
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,619
Oh, hey, how about her?

274
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,039
Sure, if he wants to spend years
doing her homework...

275
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,417
...while she drinks herself into a stupor
with nonfat White Russians.

276
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,003
And you're holding her head
while she's puking...

277
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,381
...and wishes more guys were like you.

278
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,883
She gets into Cornell,
because you wrote her essay.

279
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:13,262
And you drive up to visit her one weekend
and she acts like she doesn't know you.

280
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,600
Okay, so not her either.

281
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,645
How about her?

282
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,691
Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby,
so probably low self-esteem.

283
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,942
I think that's our girl.

284
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,735
One of us should go talk to her.

285
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,696
I can't talk to her, you do it.

286
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,823
I can't just go up and talk to her.

287
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,157
Howard, you talk to her.

288
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,704
I don't know, she'll never go for the kid
once she gets a peek at this.

289
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,457
In India, this would be simpler.

290
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,836
Five minutes with her dad, 20 goats
and a laptop, and we'd be done.

291
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,713
Well, we're not in India.

292
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,631
Why don't we do it your way, then?

293
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:54,178
We'll arrange for her to move in across the
hall so he can pathetically moon over her.

294
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,433
- Okay, that was uncalled for.
- You started it, dude.

please?

297
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,190
What a wonderful occasion this is.

298
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,736
And how fortunate that it should
fall on Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

299
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,241
We're here to welcome Mr. Dennis Kim
to our little family.

300
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,660
Welcome, Dennis Kim.

301
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,457
Mr. Kim was not only the valedictorian
at Stanford University...

302
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:27,962
...he is also the youngest recipient
of the prestigious Stevenson Award.

303
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,506
Youngest till the cyborgs rise up.

304
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,301
And now, without any further ado...

305
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:39,098
...let me introduce the man of the hour,
Mr. Dennis Kim.

306
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,144
Dennis? Dennis.

307
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,480
What?

308
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,941
Would you like to tell us
about your upcoming research?

309
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,320
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm going to the mall with Emma.

310
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,952
The kid got a girl.

311
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,080
Unbelievable.

312
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,750
Did anyone see how he did it?

313
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,919
Don't worry, I've got this.

314
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:12,048
Ladies and gentlemen,
honored daughters...

315
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,384
...while Mr. Kim,
by virtue of his youth and naiveté...

316
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,846
...has fallen prey to the inexplicable need
for human contact...

317
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,850
...let me step in and assure you
that my research will go on uninterrupted.

318
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:28,147
And that social relationships
will continue to baffle and repulse me.

319
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,899
Thank you.

- Yeah, mission accomplished.

322
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,324
Forget the mission. How did that
little yutz get a girl on his own?

323
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,244
I guess times have changed
since we were young.

324
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,538
Smart is the new sexy.

325
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,291
Then why do we go home alone
every night? We're still smart.

326
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,377
Maybe we're too smart.

327
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,337
So smart, it's off-putting.

328
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,174
Yeah, let's go with that.

329
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,138
Unbelievable.

330
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,890
Components I built
are on the space station...

331
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,810
...and I get a ticket
for launching a rocket in the park.

332
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,897
I don't know if the ticket was so much for
the launch as for telling the policewoman:

333
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,359
"You have to frisk me.
I have another rocket in my pants."

334
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,528
Hey, look at that.

335
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,323
It's Dennis Kim.

336
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,909
Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.

337
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,078
I kind of feel bad
about what we did to him.

338
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,419
Yeah, we really ruined his life.

339
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,256
Screw him, he was weak.

00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:05,004
Ooh, more details
about the new Star Trek film.

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:09,341
There's going to be a scene
depicting Spock's birth.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,095
I'd be more interested in a scene
depicting Spock's conception.

4
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:19,268
Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating,
or, if you will, Pon farr...

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,688
- ...it's an extremely private matter.
- I'd like to know the details.

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,983
His mother was human. His father
was Vulcan. They couldn't conceive.

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,194
Maybe they had to go to a clinic.
Can you imagine Spock's dad...

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,073
...with a copy of
Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears?

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,411
How come on Star Trek
everybody's private parts are the same?

00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:42,207
No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk,

Hi. Can you help me?

13
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,880
I was writing an e-mail
and the A key got stuck.

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,716
Now it's just going, "Aaaah."

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,218
- What'd you spill on it?
- Nothing.

16
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,554
Diet Coke.

17
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,807
And yogurt.

18
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,225
And a little nail polish.

19
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,019
I'll take a look at it.

20

Gentlemen, switching
to local nerd news...

21
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,067
...Fishman, Chen, Chaudury and McNair
aren't fielding a team...

22
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,110
...in the Physics Bowl this year.

23
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,155
- You're kidding. Why not?
- They formed a barbershop quartet...

24
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,492
...and got a gig playing
Knott's Berry Farm.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,830
Wow. So in your world,
you're like the cool guys.

26
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,750
Recognize.

27
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,045
This is our year. With those guys out...

28
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,923
...the entire Physics Bowl
will kneel before Zod.

29
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,842
- Zod?
- Kryptonian villain. Long story.

30
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,344
Good story.

31
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,933
- Count me out.
- What? Why?

32
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,311
You want me to use my intelligence
in a tawdry competition?

33
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:48,065
Would you ask Picasso
to play Pictionary?

34
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,360
Would you ask Noah Webster
to play Boggle?

35
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,780
Would you ask Jacques Cousteau
to play Go Fish?

36
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,742
Come on, you need a four-person team.
We're four people.

37
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,912
By that reasoning we should also
play bridge, hold up a huppah...

38
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,040
...and enter the Olympic bobsled
competition.

39
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,209
Tickets to that, please.

Spock's dying words to you?

41

No, don't.

"Or the one."

45
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,474
Damn it, I'll do it.

46
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,794
Okay, first order
of Physics Bowl business.

47
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,007
We need a truly kick-ass team name.
Suggestions?

48
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,552
How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?

49
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,848
It's beyond the laws of physics,
plus a little heads up for the ladies.

50
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,018
- The ladies?
- Perpetual Motion Squad...

51
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,520
...we can go all night.

52
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,564
- I like it.
- I don't.

53
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,275
Teams are traditionally named after
fierce creatures...

54
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,569
...thus intimidating one's opponent.

55
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,237
We could be the Bengal Tigers.

56
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,364
Poor choice. Gram for gram...

57
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,619
...no animal exceeds the relative
fighting strength of the army ant.

58
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:28,457
Maybe so, but you can't incinerate
a Bengal tiger with a magnifying glass.

59
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,170
Let's put it to a vote.

60
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,172
- All those in favor...
- Point of order.

61
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,549
I move that any vote on team names
be unanimous.

62
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,844
No man should be forced to emblazon
his chest with a Bengal tiger...

63
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,181
...when common sense dictates
it should be an army ant.

64
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,684
Will the gentleman from the great
state of denial yield for a question?

65
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,687
- I will yield.
- After we go through the exercise...

66
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,982
...of an annoying series of votes,
which the gentleman will lose...

67
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,568
...does he intend to quit
if he does not get his way?

68
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,113
- He does.
- We are the Army Ants. All those in favor?

69
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,494
Good afternoon and welcome
to today's Physics Bowl practice round.

70
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,704
I'm Penny,
and I'll be your host because...

71
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,791
...I didn't have anything else
to do on a Saturday afternoon...

72
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,543
...and isn't that just a little sad?

73
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,672
- Gentlemen, are you ready?
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Yes.

74
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,966
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: Fire away.
- It's none of my business...

75
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,344
...but is a guy who can't speak
in front of women gonna hold you back?

76
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,222
Oh, he'll be okay once the women
are mixed into the crowd.

77
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,934
He only has a problem
when they're one-on-one and smell nice.

78
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,436
Oh, thanks, Raj. It's vanilla oil.

79
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,023
I was actually the one who noticed.
Okay, let's just start.

80
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,651
Okay, the first question
is on the topic of optics.

81
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,070
"What is the shortest light pulse
ever produced?"

82
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,280
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

83
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,825
- Dr. Cooper.
- Of course, the answer is 130 attoseconds.

84
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,035
- That is correct.
- I knew that too.

85
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,580
Good for you, sweetie.
Okay, next question.

86
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,459
"What is the quantum-mechanical effect
used to encode data on hard-disk drives?"

87
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,669
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

88
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,089
- Howard?
- The answer is giant magnetoresistance.

89
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,341
- Right.
- Hey, I buzzed in.

90
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,052
And I answered. It's called teamwork.

91
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,308
Don't you think I should answer
engineering questions? I am an engineer.

92
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:14,313
By that logic, I should answer anthropology
questions because I'm a mammal.

93
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,108
Just ask another one.

94
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,401
Okay.

95
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,905
"What artificial satellite has seen glimpses
of Einstein's predicted 'frame dragging'?"

96
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,115
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

97
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,409
And, of course, it's Gravity Probe B.

98
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,329
Sheldon, you have to let
somebody else answer.

99
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,789
- Why?
- Because it's polite.

100
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,752
What do manners have to do with it?
This is war.

101
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,838
Were the Romans polite
when they salted Carthage...

102
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,466
...to make sure
nothing would ever grow again?

103
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,303
Leonard, you said
I only had to ask questions.

104
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,265
The objective is to give correct answers.

105
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,392
If I know them,
why shouldn't I give them?

106
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,312
Some of us might have
the correct answers too.

107
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,231
- Please. You don't even have a Ph.D.
- All right, that's it.

108
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,692
- Howard, sit down.
- Okay.

109
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,155
- We should take a little break.
- Good idea. I need my wrist brace.

110
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,617
All this button pushing is aggravating
my old Nintendo injury.

111
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,826
<font color="#E86CE4">(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)</font>

112
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,036
I agree.

113
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,245
What did he say?

114
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:17,376
He compared Sheldon to a disposable
feminine cleansing product...

115
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,170
...one might use on a summer's eve.

116
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,966
Yeah, and the bag it came in.

117
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,014
Leonard, excellent.
I wanna show you something.

118
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,058
Can it wait? I need to talk to you.

119
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,353
Just look. I've designed
the perfect uniforms for our team.

120
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,106
The colors are based
on Star Trek: The Original Series.

121
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:43,527
The three of you will wear support red
and I will wear command gold.

122
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,946
Why do they say "AA"?

123
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,656
Army Ants.

124
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,828
Isn't that confusing? AA might mean
something else to certain people.

125
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,582
Why would a Physics Bowl team
be called Anodized Aluminum?

126
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,959
No, I meant...

127
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,920
Never mind.

128
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,797
Hey, check it out.

129
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,092
I got you a Batman cookie jar.

130
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,345
Oh, neat. What's the occasion?

131
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,640
Well, you're a friend
and you like Batman and cookies...

132
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,308
...and you're off the team.

133
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,021
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
What?

134
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,524
Howard, Raj and I
just had a team meeting.

135
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,860
- You didn't.
- We did. I just came from there.

136
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,530
I don't know where you just came from.
It couldn't have been a team meeting.

137
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,617
I'm on the team and I wasn't there.
Ergo, the team did not meet.

138
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,912
Okay, let me try it this way.

139
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,832
I was at a coffee klatch
with a couple of friends...

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,711
...and one thing led to another
and, it turns out, you're off the team.

141
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,840
- Why?
- Because you're taking all the fun out of it.

142
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,969
I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics Bowl
the team that has the most fun?

143
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,762
Okay. Let me try it this way.

144
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,641
You're annoying and no one wants
to play with you anymore.

145
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,061
I see.

146
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:06,401
Well, at this point I should inform you
that I intend to form my own team...

147
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,946
...and destroy the molecular bonds
that bind your very matter together...

148
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:14,242
...and reduce the resulting
particulate chaos to tears.

149
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,704
Thanks for the heads up.

150
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,123
You're welcome.

151
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,584
- One more thing.
- Yes?

152
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,794
It's on, bitch.

153
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,806
- So who did he get to be on his team?
- He won't say.

154
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,810
He just smiles
and eats macaroons out of his Bat-Jar.

155
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,440
He's using psychological warfare.
We must reply in kind.

156
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,276
I say we wait until he looks at us,
then laugh like:

157
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,779
"Yes, you are a smart
and strong competitor.

158
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,614
But we are also smart and strong...

159
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,201
...and we have a reasonable chance
of defeating you."

160
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,621
How exactly would that laugh go?

161
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,292
Hee-hee-hee!

162
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,794
That sounds more like:

163
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:11,466
"We are a tall, thin woman who wants
to make a coat out of your dalmatians."

164
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:16,179
Guys, let's remember that Sheldon
is still our friend and my roommate.

165
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,389
So?

166
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,058
So nothing. Let's destroy him.

167
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,852
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Gentlemen.

168
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,355
<font color="#808080">RAJESH</font>:
Hee-hee-hee!

169
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,988
Okay, we're gonna need a strong fourth
for our team.

170
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,950
You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played TV's Blossom.

171
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,870
She got a Ph.D. in neuroscience
or something.

172
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:45,166
Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom
to join our Physics Bowl team.

173
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,254
How about the girl from
The Wonder Years?

174
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,634
Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution
to all our problems.

175
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,722
We can't ask Leslie Winkle.

176
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,515
Why? Because you slept together...

177
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,477
...and when she was done with you,
she discarded you like last night's chutney?

178
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,691
Yes.

179
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,404
- You gotta take one for the team.
- Yeah. Sack up, dude.

180
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,407
Fine.

181
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,994
Here I go, taking one for the team...

182
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,204
...in the sack.

183
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,751
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hi, guys.

184
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,253
Ahem. So, Leslie,
I have a question for you...

185
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,507
...and it might be a little awkward,
you know, given that I...

186
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,885
Hit that thing.

187
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,224
There's no reason to feel uncomfortable
because we've seen each other's faces...

188
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,936
...and naked bodies contorted
in the sweet agony of coitus.

189
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,275
There's not? Gee, because it sure sounds
like there should be.

190
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,905
Any aspects of our sexual relationship,
regarding your preferences...

191
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,492
...your idiosyncrasies, your performance,
are protected by the inherent...

192
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,745
- ...confidentiality of the bedroom.
- That's all very comforting...

193
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,789
...but I'd like to get on my question now.

194
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,542
- Proceed.
- We are entering the Physics Bowl...

195
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,795
- ...and we need a fourth.
- No, thanks.

196
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:15,131
I'm really busy with my like-sign dilepton
supersymmetry search.

197
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,218
Dilepton shmylepton, we need you.

198
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,136
Sorry.

199
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,639
Well, we tried.

200
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:27,143
We'll just have to face Sheldon
mano y mano y mano a mano.

201
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,604
Wait, you're going up against
Sheldon Cooper?

202
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,273
- Yes.
- That arrogant, misogynistic...

203
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,277
...doorknob that told me I should abandon
my work with high-energy particles...

204
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,698
...for laundry and childbearing?

205
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,618
She's in.

206
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,664
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
So how do you feel?

207
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,834
Nice and loose? Come to play?
Got your game face on?

208
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,045
- Are you ready?
<font color="#808080">ALL</font>: Oh.

209
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,006
Yeah. You don't have to stay
for the whole thing.

210
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,884
Oh, no, no, I want to.
Sounds really interesting.

211
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,094
Okay.

212
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,309
- Gentlemen.
- Sheldon.

213
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,646
- Sheldon.
- Hee-hee-hee.

214
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,858
Sheldon.

215
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,319
I'm just gonna sit down.

216
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,658
So is that your team?

217
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,410
Actually, I don't need a team.

218
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,539
I could easily defeat you single-handedly,
but the rules require four.

219
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:34,002
So may I introduce the third-floor janitor,
the lady from the lunch room and...

220
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,089
My Spanish is not good.
...either her son or her butcher.

221
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,966
And what about your team?

222
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,178
What rat have you recruited
to the S.S. Sinking Ship?

223
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,388
<font color="#808080">LESLIE</font>:
Hello, Sheldon.

224
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,100
Leslie Winkle.

225
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,770
Yeah, Leslie Winkle.
The answer to the question:

226
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,689
"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry
like a little girl?"

227
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,778
Yes, well, I'm polymerized tree sap,
and you're an inorganic adhesive.

228
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,740
So whatever verbal projectile you launch
in my direction is reflected off of me...

229
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,160
...returns on its original trajectory,
and adheres to you.

230
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,121
Oh, ouch.

231
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,249
Okay, if everyone could please
take your seats?

232
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,134
Here's your T-shirt.

233
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,555
PMS?

234
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,808
It's a couple days early.

235
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,518
No.

236
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,395
It stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.

237
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,564
Oh, right, of course.
What was I thinking?

238
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,655
Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl.

239
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,451
Today's preliminary match
features two great teams:

240
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:53,790
AA versus PMS.

241
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,959
All night long, y'all.

242
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,550
Okay, well, let's jump right in.
First question.

243
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:09,055
For 10 points. "What is the isospin
singlet partner of the pi-zero meson?"

244
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,306
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

245
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,308
- PMS?
- The eta meson.

246
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,768
Correct.

247
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,230
- Formal protest.
- On what grounds?

248
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,525
The Velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt.

249
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,653
Denied. All right, for 10 points.

250
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,699
"What is the lightest element on Earth
with no stable isotope?"

251
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,992
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

252
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,244
- AA?
- And, of course, the answer is technetium.

253
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,121
Terrific.

254
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,083
Next question. "What is the force
between two uncharged plates...

255
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,085
...due to quantum vacuum fluctuation?"

256
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,295
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

257
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,005
- PMS?
- And Sheldon can suck on...

258
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,257
- ...the Casimir effect.
<font color="#808080">GABLEHAUSER</font>: Correct.

259
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,557
"How does a quantum computer
factor large numbers?"

260
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,766
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

261
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,518
- PMS?
- Shor's algorithm.

262
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,728
<font color="#808080">GABLEHAUSER</font>:
Correct.

263
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,068
Four-point-one-eight-five-five times 10
to the seventh ergs per calorie.

264
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,154
Prévost's theory of exchanges.

265
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,656
Lambda equals one over pi-R-squared N.

266
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,700
Seven hundred and sixty degrees Celsius.

267
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,953
The approximate temperature
of the young lady in the front row.

268
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,956
Mr. Wolowitz,
this is your second warning.

269
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,001
A sigma particle.

270
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,588
Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the Earth.

271
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,381
<font color="#808080">GABLEHAUSER</font>:
Correct.

272
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,932
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hold in my hand the final question.

273
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:41,356
The score now stands,
AA, 1150, PMS, 1175.

274
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,859
So for 100 points and the match...

275
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:49,530
...please turn your attention
to the formula on the screens.

276
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,407
Solve the equation.

277
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,994
Holy crap.

278
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,622
What the hell is that?

279
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,459
It looks like something they found
on the ship at Roswell.

280
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,296
- Come on, think. Leslie?
- It's not gonna work if you rush me.

281
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,258
- You have to let me get there.
- You are never gonna let that go, are you?

282
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,677
Ten seconds.

283
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,139
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

284
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,641
PMS?

285
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,852
Sorry, I panicked.

286
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,938
Then guess.

287
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,731
Um...

288
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,401
Eight.

289
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,532
Point four.

290
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,909
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

291
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:39,080
AA, if you can answer correctly,
the match is yours.

292
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,503
He doesn't have it. He's got squat.

293
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,764
AA, I need your answer.

294
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,766
<font color="#E86CE4">(BUZZER SOUNDS)</font>

295
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,102
The answer is minus eight pi alpha.

296
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,187
Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.

297
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,314
- What are you doing?
- Answering question.

298
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,692
Winning Physics Bowl.

299
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,112
How do you know anything
about physics?

300
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,700
Here, I am janitor.
In former Soviet Union, I am physicist.

301
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,994
Leningrad Politechnika.

302
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,329
Go, Polar Bears.

303
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,792
That's a delightful little story.

304
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,211
Our arrangement was
you sit and not say anything.

305
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,922
- I answer the questions.
- You didn't answer question.

306
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,342
Hey, look. Now, maybe you have democracy
now in your beloved Russia...

307
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,387
...but on this Physics Bowl team,
I rule with an iron fist.

308
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,847
Ow!

309
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,516
AA, I need your official answer.

310
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,769
- It's not what he said.
- Then what is it?

311
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,104
- I want a different question.
- You can't.

312
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,481
- Formal protest.
- Denied.

313
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,107
Informal protest.

314
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,485
Denied.

315
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,738
- I need your official answer.
- No, I decline to provide one.

316
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,200
That's too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct.

317
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,120
That's your opinion.

318
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,875
- All right, the winner of the match is...
- Hang on.

319
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:10,838
Sheldon, is proving you are single-handedly
smarter than everyone else so important...

320
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,509
...that you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team?

321
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,970
I didn't understand the question.

322
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,891
- Go ahead.
- The winner is PMS.

323
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,598
Sorry, somebody's sitting there.

324
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,228
- Who?
- My Physics Bowl trophy.

325
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,275
That trophy is meaningless.
I forfeited, therefore you did not win.

326
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,527
- I know someone who would disagree.
- Who?

327
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,029
My Physics Bowl trophy.

328
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,408
"Leonard is so smart.

329
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,244
- Sheldon who?"
- All right, that is just very immature.

330
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,579
You're right. I'm sorry.

331
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,039
"I'm not!"

332
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,835
- Okay, new contest.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: What are you doing?

333
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,173
I am settling, once and for all,
who is the smartest around here.

334
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,966
- Okay? Are you ready?
- Absolutely.

335
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,593
- Bring it on.
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Okay.

336
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,431
"Marsha, Jan and Cindy were
the three daughters in what TV family?"

337
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,936
The Brady Bunch.

338
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,731
Okay.

339
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,735
"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth
as the lead singer in what group?"

340
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,450
The Brady Bunch?

341
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,578
Van Halen.

342
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,749
All right. "Madonna was married
to this Ridgemont High alum."

343
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,295
Oh, my God. Sean Penn.

344
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,839
How do you know these things?

345
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,635
I go outside and I talk to people.

346
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,138
Okay, here.
"What actor holds the record...

347
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,141
...for being named People magazine's
Sexiest Man Alive?"

348
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,019
- William Shatner.
- Wait.

349
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,689
I don't think it's Shatner.

350
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,150
Then it's gotta be Patrick Stewart.

351
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,781
- No.
- Formal protest.

352
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,494
All right. "Singer who sang
'Oops!... I Did It Again'?"

353
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,875
Okay.

354
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,545
"Tweety bird thought he saw a what?"

355
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,510
Romulan.

356
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,642
Yes. He thought he saw a Romulan.

357
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,187
<font color="#E86CE4">(PENNY SIGHS)</font>

1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:06,296
Well, this sandwich
is an unmitigated disaster.

2
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,132
I asked for turkey and roast beef...

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,968
- ...with lettuce and Swiss on whole wheat.
- What'd they give you?

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,972
Turkey and roast beef
with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,939
It's the right ingredients
but in the wrong order.

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,859
In a proper sandwich,
the cheese is adjacent to the bread...

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,320
...to create a moisture barrier
against the lettuce.

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,116
They might as well have dragged this thing
through a car wash.

9
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,995
- I don't believe it.
- I know. It's basic culinary science.

10
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,123
Some guy is auctioning off
a miniature time-machine prop...

11
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,709
...from the original film
and no one is bidding.

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,628
A time machine
from the movie The Time Machine?

13
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,965
No, a time machine
from Sophie's Choice.

14
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,968
Boy, Sophie could have used
a time machine in that movie.

15
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,345
Did you see it? It's rough.

16
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,057
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: Oh, that's cool.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Uh-huh.

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,642
- It's only $800?
- Yeah. And that's my bid.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,562
- You bid $800?
- It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,357
I figured it would go for thousands,
and I just wanted to be a part of it.

20
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,652
- There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
- Do you have $800?

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,031
- Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
- Don't worry.

22
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,576
People wait until the last second,
then they get it. It's called sniping.

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,371
- Fifteen seconds.
- Come on, snipers.

24
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,709
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Where are your snipers?

25
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,503
- Five.
- Snipe.

26
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,670
- Four.
- Snipe.

27
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,881
- Three, two.
- Snipe, snipe.

28
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,257
- One.
- Ah!

29
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:38,138
Oh. Congratulations, you are the proud
owner of a miniature time machine.

30
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,932
- You lucky duck.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Heh.

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,558
I wonder why no one else bid.

32
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,186
This is a classic piece
of sci-fi movie memorabilia.

33
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,438
I know. But I still can't afford it.

34
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,149
Why don't we share it?
We'll each put in 200 bucks...

35
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,986
- ...and take turns having it in our house.
- A time-share time machine.

36
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,407
- I'm in. Sheldon?
- Wha...? Need you ask?

37
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,868
But I still don't understand
why no one else bid.

38
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,922
I understand why no one else bid.

39
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,578
Did the listing actually say "miniature"?

40
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,582
I just assumed.

41
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,587
Well, who sells a full-sized time machine
for $800?

42
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,423
In a Venn diagram,
that would be an individual located...

43
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,426
...within the intersection of
"no longer want time machine"...

44
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,262
...and "need $800."

45
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,598
It's actually a tremendous bargain.

46
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:07,019
Even with shipping,
it works out to less than $4 a pound.

47
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,730
Cocktail shrimp are 12.50.

48
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,484
How are we gonna get it upstairs?

49
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,821
If we take the dish off,
it might fit in the elevator.

50
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,490
Yes, but the elevator's been broken
for two years.

51
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,369
I've been meaning to ask you, do you think
we should make a call about that?

52
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,790
Not necessary.
I have a Master's in engineering.

53
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,835
I remotely repair satellites
on a regular basis.

54
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,464
I troubleshoot space-shuttle payloads.

55
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,883
When the Mars rover
started pulling to the left...

56
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:43,764
...I performed a front-end alignment
from 62 million miles away.

57
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,983
No, that baby's broken.

Take a break, guys.

67
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,515
- What are you doing?
- Just moving something upstairs.

68
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,186
- What is it?
- Just, you know, a time machine.

69
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,730
Okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

70
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,858
- Just give us a few minutes.
- I'm running really late.

71
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,402
Then I have a simple solution.

72
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,571
Go up to the roof, hop over
to the next building... There's a gap.

73
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,534
Don't look down if you're subject
to vertigo... and use their stairwell.

74
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,997
- You're joking, right?
- Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

75
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,001
Damn. Okay, I'll just take the roof.

76
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,378
If you wait for us
to set up the time machine...

77
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,714
...I can drop you off at work yesterday.

78
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,968
Time-travel joke. It's not... Never mind.

79
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,723
For what it's worth,
I thought it was humorous.

<font color="#808080">RAJESH</font>: In a minute.

83
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,400
Howard stepped outside to throw up.

84
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,743
I don't know what you were worried about.
I think it really works in the room.

85
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:32,122
Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing
I have ever owned.

86
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,250
The exact time machine
that carried actor Rod Taylor...

87
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,253
...from Victorian England
into the post-apocalyptic future...

88
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,672
...where society had splintered
into two factions:

89
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,215
the subterranean Morlocks...

90
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:46,428
...who survived by feasting on the flesh
of the gentle surface-dwelling Eloi.

91
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,600
Talk about your chick magnets.

92
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,687
Oh, yeah. The guy who lives next to me
is always like:

93
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,316
"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony.
I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony."

94
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,445
But wait until I tell him
I've got a time machine on my balcony.

95
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,908
Stuff that in your Speedos, Jacuzzi Bob.

96
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,285
Gentlemen, we said we'd take turns...

97
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,997
...but I think you'll agree
that practicality dictates it remain here.

98
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,458
You can't keep it.
What if I meet a girl and say:

99
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,336
"You wanna see my time machine?
It's at my friend's house."

100
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,630
How lame is that?

101
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,340
- He's got a point.
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: All right.

102
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:27,135
We're going to need some ground rules.
"No shoes in the time machine."

103
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,805
"No eating in the time machine."
I propose that we add:

104
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,725
"Pants must be worn at all times
in the time machine."

105
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,811
Seconded.

106
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,647
I was gonna put down a towel.

107
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,737
I still want it on my balcony.
I say we move it on a bimonthly basis.

108
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,865
- That sounds fair.
- Hold on. Bimonthly is an ambiguous term.

109
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,660
- Every other month or twice a month?
- Twice a month.

110
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,829
- Then no.
- Okay, every other month.

111
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,539
No.

112
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,749
Sheldon, you can't be selfish.

113

We all paid for it,
so it belongs to all of us.

invents the telephone and calls for Watson.

- So when it's your turn, you can.

119
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,196
If we all go back to the same time,
Bell's lab's going to get very crowded.

120
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,365
He'll know something's up.

121
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,701
Since the time machine
doesn't move in space...

122
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,037
- ...you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.
- Even if you make it to Boston...

123
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,708
...what are you gonna do? Knock and say
to Mrs. Bell, "Fan of your husband.

124
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,711
Can I come in and watch him
invent the telephone?"

125
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,714
Mrs. Bell was deaf.
She's not even gonna hear you knock.

126
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,217
I have a solution.
First, go into the future...

127
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,304
- ...and obtain a cloaking device.
- Ooh. How far into the future?

128
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,891
If I remember, Kirk will steal
a cloaking device from the Romulans...

129
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,185
...on stardate 5027.3...

130
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:02,564
...which would be January 10th, 2328,
by pre-Federation reckoning.

131
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:08,403
Okay, I am setting the dials

141

And they tried to fix me up with their son.

- That...
- Again, time machine.

155
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,576
Oh, please, it's not a time machine.
If anything, it looks like...

156
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,662
...something Elton John would drive
through the Everglades.

157
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,336
It only moves in time.

- So it's my turn.

Why'd you set it
for the day before yesterday?

164
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,929
Because I wanna go back and keep myself
from getting a time machine.

165
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,433
You can't. If you were to prevent yourself
from buying it in the past...

166
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,686
...you would not have it available
to stop yourself from buying it.

167
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:51,066
Ergo, you would still have it.
This is a classic rookie time-travel mistake.

168
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,155
Can I go back and prevent you
from explaining that to me?

169
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,698
Same paradox.

170
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,743
If you were to travel back in time
and knock me unconscious...

171
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,204
...you wouldn't have the conversation
that irritated you...

172
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,998
...motivating you to go back
and knock me unconscious.

173
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,669
What if I knocked you unconscious
right now?

174
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,255
It won't change the past.

175
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,176
But it'd make the present so much nicer.

176
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,638
Are you upset about something?

177
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,765
What was your first clue?

178
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,310
Well, it was a number of things.
First, the late hour.

179
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,354
Then your demeanor
seems very low-energy.

180
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,356
- Plus your irritability...
- Yes, I'm upset.

181
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,565
Oh.

182
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,527
I don't usually pick up on those things.

183
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,320
Good for me.

184
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,949
Yeah, good for you.

185
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,201
Oh, wait.

186
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,414
Did you wanna talk about
what's bothering you?

187
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,459
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Wow, I'm on fire tonight.

188
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,550
Well, here's the thing.

189
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,804
Girls like Penny never end up with guys
who own time machines.

190
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,389
I disagree.

191
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,850
Your inability
to successfully woo Penny...

192
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,228
...long predates your acquisition
of the time machine.

193
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,983
That failure clearly stands on its own.

194
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,112
- Thanks for pointing it out.
- In addition, your premise is flawed.

195
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,157
In the original film,
Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux...

196
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,742
...with that time machine.

197
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,619
In Back to the Future,
Marty McFly got to hook up...

198
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,581
...with his extremely attractive
young mother.

199
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,711
- Those are movies.
- Of course they're movies.

200
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,382
Are you expecting an example
involving a real-life time machine?

201
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,178
That's absurd.

202

208
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,199
Oh, you know,
just moving a time machine.

209
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,327
Yeah, okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

210
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,245
No problem.

211
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,753
Hang on.

212
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,631
But what about your time machine?

213
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,884
Some things are more important
than toys.

214
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,560
I'm scared.

215
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,896
Don't worry, baby, I've got you.

216
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,398
Oh, Leonard.

217
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,545
It's still my turn.

218
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,760
What are you doing?

219
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,971
I'm packing up all my collectibles...

220
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,598
...and taking them down
to the comic-book store to sell.

221
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,934
Is that really necessary?

222
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,187
If you need money,
you can always sell blood.

223
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,315
And semen.

224
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,192
It's not about money.

225
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,444
We brought food.

226
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,656
Lox and bagels,
the breakfast of time travelers.

227
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,492
Terrific. Anyone wanna buy
my share of the time machine?

228
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,619
- Why?
- Because I don't want it anymore.

229
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,205
- Why?
- Just personal reasons.

230
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,417
My Spidey sense tells me
this has something to do with Penny.

231
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,128
Look, do you wanna buy me out or not?

232
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:44,132
I'll give you $100, which will make me
half-owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.

233
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,135
Screw his balcony.
I'll give you 120 and put it in my garage.

234
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,763
- I paid $200 for my share.
- Everybody knows a time machine loses...

235
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,017
...half its value the minute
you drive it off the lot.

236
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,103
I'll go for 200.
That time machine stays right where it is.

237
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,857
Three hundred. And I'll throw in my original
1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon...

238
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,901
...with real light-speed sound effects.

239
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,780
No. No more toys or action figures
or props or replicas...

240
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,326
...or costumes or robots
or Darth Vader voice changers.

241
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,411
I'm getting rid of all of it.

242
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,622
You can't do that.
Look what you've created.

243
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,207
It's like Nerdvana.

244
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,088
More importantly,
you have a Darth Vader voice changer?

245
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,551
- Not for long.
- I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.

246
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,721
I need that to complete
my Justice Society of America collection.

247
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,181
- I called dibs.
- You can't.

248
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,225
I can and I did.
Look up "dibs" in Wikipedia.

249
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,937
Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.

250
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,857
It's not a bidding war. I'm selling it all
to Larry down at the comic-book store.

251
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,985
- Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
- Will you forget dibs?

252
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,529
He offered me a fair price
for the whole collection.

253
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,992
- What's the number? I'll match it.
- I'll match it, plus 1000 rupees.

254
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,829
- What's the exchange rate?
- None of your business. Take it or leave it.

255
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,540
Mom, my bar mitzvah bonds,
how much do I got?

256
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,670
Thanks. I can go $2600
and two trees in Israel.

257
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,258
Forget it. Guys, if I sell to one of you,
the other two are gonna be mad at me.

258
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,387
Who cares? As long as you pick me.

259
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,639
Okay, Leonard, put down the box.
Let's talk.

260
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,975
Sorry, Raj, my mind is made up.

261
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,395
No. I can't let you do this.

262
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,690

263
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,695
None shall pass.

264
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,241
Okay.

265
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,951
I did not wanna do this...

266
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,204
...but I have here the rare,
mint-condition, production-era...

267

...in the original packaging.

269

If you do not get out of my way...

270
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,464
...I will open it.

271
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,300
Okay, man, be cool.

272
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,678
We're all friends here.

273
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,556
What the hell's going on?

274
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,350
- You hypocrite.
- What?

Don't-Play-With-Toys.

276
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,732
If I went into that apartment right now,
would I not find Beanie Babies?

277
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,776
Are you not an accumulator
of Care Bears and My Little Ponies?

278
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,863
And who is that Japanese feline
I see frolicking on your shorts?

279
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,574
Hello, Hello Kitty.

280
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,621
Okay, okay, look,
if this is about yesterday, Leonard...

281
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,541
...I am really sorry about what I said.
I was just upset.

282
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,461
- No, I needed to hear it.
- You didn't. You are a great guy.

283
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,797
And it is the things you love
that make you who you are.

284
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,384
I guess that makes me large breasts.

285
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,807
Still, I think it's time for me
to get rid of this stuff...

286
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,810
...and, you know, move on with my life.

00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,646

00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,665
She's my twin sister.

37
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,168
She thinks she's funny, but frankly,
I've never been able to see it.

38
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,130
That's because you have
no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.

39
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,799
How exactly would one measure
a sense of humor?

40
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,093
A humormometer?

41
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,266
Well, I think you're delightfully droll.
Or as the French say:

42

<font color="#E86CE4">(SPEAKS IN FRENCH)</font>

43
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,772
Okay, so let me see if I got this.
Leonard, Howard and...

44
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,233
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

45
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,678
Rajesh.

46
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,663
So, Missy, what brings you
all the way from Texas?

47
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,625
Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.

48
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,877
My friend's getting married at Disneyland.

49
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,339
Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.

50
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,177
And I had to drop off some papers
for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.

51
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,847
The papers could've been mailed. Mom
sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?

52
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,308
I guess that's why
they call you a genius.

53
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,144
They call me a genius
because I'm a genius.

54
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,648
Tell Mom
that I currently weigh 165 pounds...

55
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,984
...and that I'm having
regular bowel movements.

56
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,861
Enjoy the wedding. Goodbye.

57
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,988
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.

58
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:04,076
If the wedding's not till tomorrow,
why don't you stay with us tonight?

59
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,204
Oh, I don't think so.
Shelly doesn't like company.

60
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,166
Even as a little boy, he'd send his imaginary
friends home at the end of the day.

61
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,753
They were not friends.
They were imaginary colleagues.

62
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,048
Look, you're here,
and we have plenty of room.

63
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,969
- No, we don't.
- Come on, Shelly, she's family.

64
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,555
So what?
I don't issue invitations to your mother.

65
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,892
It would be nice not to have to drive
to Anaheim in rush hour.

66
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,103
And don't ever call me Shelly.

67
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,522
So it's settled. You'll stay with us.

68
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,150
I'll walk you to your car.
You're in Structure 3, Level C, right?

69
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,240
What just happened?

70
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,368
So anyway, we're 8 years old...

71
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,914
...and Sheldon converts my Easy-Bake Oven
to some kind of high-powered furnace.

72
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,917
That's just classic.

73
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,129
I needed a place to fire
ceramic semiconductor substrates...

74
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,339
...for homemade integrated circuits.

75
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:03,218
He was trying to build some sort of
armed robot to keep me out of his room.

76
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:07,055
Made necessary by her insistence
on going into my room.

77
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,517
Anyway, I make those little muffins
they give you. There's a big flash.

78
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,353
Next thing you know,
my eyebrows are gone.

79
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,024
Not your eyebrows?

80
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,526
Yep, I had to go through
the entire second grade...

81
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,279
...with crooked eyebrows
my mom drew on.

82
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,448
Is that what that was? I just assumed...

83
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,117
...that the second-grade curriculum
had rendered you quizzical.

00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,750
Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear
in the drier downstairs.

86
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,670
Pfft.

87
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,798
Those are not mine.

88
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,762
Really? They have
your little name label in them.

89
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,098
Oh, yeah, no, I use those...

90
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:54,603
...just to polish up
my spearfishing equipment.

91
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,439
I spearfish.

92
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,820
When I'm not crossbow hunting,
I spearfish.

93
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,951
Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister.
Missy, this is our neighbor Penny.

94
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,162
- Hi.
- Wow, you don't look that much alike.

95
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,873
Can I get a hallelujah?

96
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,584
Fraternal twins
come from two separate eggs.

97
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,961
They are no more alike
than any other siblings.

98
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,005
Hallelujah.

99
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,757
Hey, guess what.

100
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,176
I've been accepted as a test subject
for a drug...

101
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,512
...to overcome pathological shyness.

102
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,807
- Oh, good for you, Raj.
- Yes, I'm very hopeful.

103
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,600
Hello, Missy.

104
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,695
They mentioned
there may be side effects.

105
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,324
So, Missy...

106
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,912
...have you ever met a man
from the exotic subcontinent of India?

107
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:58,875
- Well, there's Dr. Patel at our church.
- Yes, Patel. Good man.

108
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,129
Do you like motorcycles?
Because I ride a hog.

109
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,174
A hog? You have a two-cylinder scooter
with a basket in the front.

110
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,304
You still have to wear a helmet.

111
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,808
- Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
- The sex book.

112
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,935
The Indian sex book.

113
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,814
In other words, if you wonder, wonder
who wrote the book of love...

114
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,732
...it was us.

115
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,696
- So Sheldon's sister is pretty cute, huh?
- I wasn't staring.

116
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,325
I didn't say you were.
I just said she was cute.

117
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,952
Oh. Eh...

118
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,415
Maybe. If you like women who are tall.

119
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,209
And perfect.

120
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,505
Sheldon,
why are you ignoring your sister?

121
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,676
I'm not ignoring my sister.
I'm ignoring all of you.

122
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,344
I brought snacks.

123
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,015
Oh, my. Gherkins and...

124
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,684
Onion dip. It's onion dip.

125
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,731
We don't entertain much.

126
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,277
Missy. Do you enjoy pajamas?

127
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,655
- I guess.
- Yeah, we Indians invented them.

128
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,033
You're welcome.

129
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,995
Yeah, well,
my people invented circumcision.

130
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,001
You're welcome.

131
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,255
Missy, I'm gonna go get my nails done.
Do you wanna come?

132
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,716
God, yes. Thanks.

133
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,718
You're welcome.

134
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,887
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Missy.

135
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,222
Bye, Missy, see you.

136
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,600
- Goodbye, Leonard.
- Yeah, no, bye, Penny.

137
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,104
- You two have to back off.
- Why should I back off? You back off.

138
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,441
Excuse me, this is my apartment,
and she's my roommate's sister.

139
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,069
- So what? You've got Penny.
- How do I have Penny?

140
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,279
In what universe do I have Penny?

141
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,950
- So I can have Penny?
- Hell, no.

142
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,079
Excuse me, can I interject something?

143
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,166
I'm ordering pizza online.
Is everyone okay with pepperoni?

144
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,505
- Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
- I guess.

145
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,341
Don't worry,
I was going to order you cheese-less.

146
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,842

151
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,326
Are you aware that your sister
is an incredibly attractive woman?

152
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,954
Hm.

153
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:45,500
She has the symmetry and low body fat
that Western culture deems desirable.

154
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,961
It's noteworthy that at other points
in history...

155
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:53,049
...heavier women were the standard for
beauty because girth suggested affluence.

156
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,552
- That's fascinating...
- I didn't say fascinating.

157
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,178
I said it was noteworthy.

158
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,724
All right. Noted.

159
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,519
But my point
is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz...

160
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,565
They're hitting on your sister.
Ugh. It's...

161
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:13,987
Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want
to criticize your rhetorical style...

162
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,531
...but we'd be further along
in this conversation...

163
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,700
...if you'd begun with that thought.

164
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,452
That's great, but...

165
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,705
We took quite a detour
from what I understand to be your thesis.

166
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,457
Whatever.

167
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,294
- You have to do something about it.
- Why?

168
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,212
Because she's your sister.

169
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,132
I don't understand.

170
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,718
Yes, we shared a uterus
for nine months.

171
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,096
But since then, we've pretty much gone
our own separate ways.

172
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,266
Okay, consider this.

173
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,020
With your father gone,
it is your responsibility...

174
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,482
...to make sure
that Missy chooses a suitable mate.

175
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,569
I hadn't considered that.

176
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,571
We do share DNA.

177
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,865
So there is the possibility,
however remote...

178
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,410
...that resting in her loins
is the potential for another individual...

179
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,372
...as remarkable as myself.

180
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:10,543
Exactly. And you owe it to yourself
and to posterity...

181
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:14,589
...to protect the genetic integrity
of your sister's future offspring.

182
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,261
You're right. If someone wants
to get at Missy's fallopian tubes...

183
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,764

You have to respect his wishes.

- You're out too, by the way.
- Say what?

194
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,636
Nothing personal.
I'd prefer my niece or nephew...

195
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,432
...didn't become flatulent
every time they ate an Eskimo Pie.

196
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,566

- I'm not happy.

It's the medication. I can't stop smiling.

of how high the genetic stakes are...

199
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,666
...we have to face the fact
that none of you are suitable for my sister.

200
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,420
Wait a minute,

00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,968
Excuse me, but I think you're missing
a big opportunity here.

203
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,304
- How so?
- Everybody knows genetic diversity...

204
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,306
...produces the strongest offspring.

205
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,059
Why not put a little mocha
in the family latte?

206
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,230
In principle, you have a point.

207
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:58,359
But as a practical matter, need I remind you
it takes experimental pharmaceuticals...

208
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:02,113
...to simply enable you
to speak to the opposite sex?

209
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,034
I think you're focusing
entirely too much on the drugs.

210
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,540
Is it because I'm Jewish?

211
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,211
Because I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop
to be with your sister.

212
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,511
This has nothing to do with religion.

213
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,138
This has to do with the fact
that you're a tiny man...

214
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,349
...who still lives with his mother.

215
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,561
- Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.
- Am I?

216
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,816
Here. Eat this cheese without farting,
and you can sleep with my sister.

217
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,985
<font color="#808080">MISSY</font>:
Oh, really?

218
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,574
Oops.

219
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,578
Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?
Alone.

220
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,082
Why does everyone
suddenly wanna talk to me alone?

221
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,252
Usually nobody wants
to be alone with me.

222
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,468
We all make mistakes. Let's move on.

223
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,555
Okay.

224
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,308
I'm not even gonna ask
why you're pimping me out for cheese...

225
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,396
...but since when do you care at all
about who I sleep with?

226
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,731
Truthfully,
I've never given it any thought...

227
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,443
...but it has been pointed out to me
that you carry DNA of great potential.

228
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,363
- What on earth are you talking about?
- Let me explain.

229
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,950
You see,
I'm a superior genetic mutation...

230
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,953
...an improvement
on the existing mediocre stock.

231
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,416
And what do you mean,
"mediocre stock"?

232
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,667
That would be you.

233
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,505
But residing within you
is the potential for another me.

234
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,884
Perhaps even taller, smarter
and less prone to freckling.

235
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,554
A Sheldon 2.0, if you will.

236
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,891
- Sheldon 2.0?
- Exactly.

237
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,811
Now, I am not saying that I should be
the sole decider of who you mate with.

238
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,523
If you're not attracted, then the likelihood
of conception will be reduced.

239
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,151
- You have got to be kidding me.
- Not at all.

240
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,613
Frequent coitus dramatically increases
the odds of fertilization.

241
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,700
Okay, Shelly, sit down.

242
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,831
Now, I've lived my whole life dealing
with the fact that my twin brother is...

243
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,960
...as Mom puts it,
one of God's special little people.

244
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,172
I always thought
I was more like a cuckoo bird.

245
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,384
A superior creature whose egg is placed
in the nest of ordinary birds.

246
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,637
The newly hatched cuckoo
eats all the food...

247
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,848
...leaving the ordinary siblings
to starve to death.

248
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,226
Luckily for you,
that's where the metaphor ended.

249
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,064
I thought it ended at cuckoo.

250
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,734
Now, you listen to me.

251
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,154
If you wanna start acting like a brother
who cares about me, terrific.

252
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,989
Bring it on.

253
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,076
But you try one time to tell me
who I should be sleeping with...

254
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:58,039
...and you and I are gonna go round the way
we did when we were little. Remember?

255
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,836
- I have an alternate proposal.
- Go on.

256
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,548
You donate eggs.
We will place them in cryogenic storage.

257
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,635
I will find an appropriate sperm donor
for your eggs...

258
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,304
...have them fertilized
and implanted in you.

259
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,764
That way, everybody wins.

260
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,069
Correction.
Missy can date whoever she wants.

261
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,365
- Look, we have to settle this.
- I agree.

262
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,160
Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's
because we've all been hitting on her.

263
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,623
She's not hiding. She needed to call her
grandmother, who's apparently very sick.

264
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,543
Oh, and then I believe
she has to wash her hair.

265
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,796
Oh, you poor deluded bastard.

266
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,173
- Don't start with me, dude.
- You wanna go again?

267
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,300
- Sit down.
- Okay.

268
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,846
If we're gonna fight over Missy,
let's do it the right way.

Hi, Leonard, what's up?

Well, since you're leaving, I was wondering
if you'd like to go to dinner with me.

That's so sweet. But no, thanks.

- No.

00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,467
My parents focused
on celebrating achievements...

33
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,387
...and being expelled from a birth canal
was not considered one of them.

34
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,058
- That's so silly.
- It's actually based on very sound theories.

35
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,144
- His mother published a paper on it.
- Well, what was it called?

36
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,688
"I Hate My Son
and That's Why He Can't Have Cake"?

37
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,441
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
It was obviously effective.

38
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,819
Leonard grew up to be
an experimental physicist.

39
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:55,697
Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas,
he'd be a little better at it.

40
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,367
Thank you.

41
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,371
Well, I love birthdays. Waking up
to Mom's special French-toast breakfast...

42
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,333
...wearing the birthday king crown,
playing laser tag with all my friends.

43
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,544
Yeah, see? That's what kids should have.

44
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,088
Actually, that was last year.

45
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,386
So you've really never had
a birthday party?

46
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,054
No, but it was okay.

47
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:23,475
When I was little, I'd think my parents
would change their mind and surprise me.

48
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,145
This one birthday,
I came home from my cello lesson...

49
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,272
...and I saw strange cars
parked out front.

50
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,440
When I got to the door,
I hear whispering...

51
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:34,027
...and I could smell German chocolate cake,
which is my favorite.

52
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,740
- And?
- It turns out my grandfather had died.

53
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,660
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

54
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,037
Well, it was kind of like a birthday party.

55
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,375
I got to see all my cousins,
and there was cake, so...

56
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,212
- That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
- You think?

57
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,423
Go ahead,
tell her about your senior prom.

58
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,619
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>:
Make sure they remember, no peanuts.

59
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,915
Howard, every Thai restaurant in town
knows you can't eat peanuts.

60
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,877
When they see me coming,
they go, "Ah, no-peanut boy."

61
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,391
- Hello, Penny, Leonard just left.
- I know, I wanna talk to you.

62
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,227
What would we talk about?

63
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,979
We have no overlapping
areas of interest I'm aware of.

64
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,399
- As you know, I don't care for chitchat.
- Can you just let me in?

65
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,778
Well, all right, but I don't see this
as a promising endeavor.

66
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,072
Okay, here's the deal.

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,158
We'll throw Leonard a kickass
surprise party for his birthday.

68
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,326
I hardly think so.

69
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,745
Leonard made it clear
he doesn't want a party.

70
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,206
Did someone say party?

71
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,627
He just doesn't know he wants one,
because he's never had one.

72
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,003
I suppose that's possible.

73
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,840
But for the record, I've never had
a threesome and yet I still know I want one.

74
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,219
Here's the difference.

75
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,180
The possibility exists
Leonard could have a birthday party...

76
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,474
...before hell freezes over.

77
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,020
Fine. If I do have a threesome,
you can't be part of it.

78
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,524
I'm just kidding. Yes, you can.

79
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,652
Can you bring a friend?

80
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,739
I think a birthday party is a terrible idea.

81
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,659
I envy Leonard for growing up
without that anguish.

82
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,868
Anguish?

83
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,122
Year after year,
I had to endure wearing conical hats...

84
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,625
...while being forced into the crowded,
sweaty hell of bouncy castles.

85
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,419
Not to mention being blindfolded...

86
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,879
...and spun toward
a grotesque tailless donkey...

87
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,091
...as the other children mocked
my disorientation.

88
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:06,179
Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars
that no non-professional can heal...

89
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,224
...but nevertheless, we're gonna
throw Leonard a birthday party.

90
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,435
I'm extremely uncomfortable
with dancing...

91
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,855
...loud music and most other forms
of alcohol-induced frivolity.

92
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,025
- Nevertheless...
- In addition...

93
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,652
You either help me
throw Leonard a birthday party...

94
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,487
...or I will go into your bedroom...

95
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,198
...and unbag all
your mint-condition comic books.

96
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:29,995
And on one of them... You won't know
which... I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.

97
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,876
You can't do that. If you make a mark
in a mint comic book, it's no longer mint.

98
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,253
Do you understand
the concept of blackmail?

99
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,255
Well, of course, I... Oh.

100
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,886
Yeah, I have an idea. Let's throw Leonard
a kickass birthday party.

101
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,366
That's not the secret knock.

102
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,036
This is the secret knock:

103
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,957
What difference does it make?

104
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,127
The point of a secret knock
is to establish a nonverbal signal...

105
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,005
...to verify the identity
of one's coconspirators.

106
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,509
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Is that Raj and Howard?
- Possibly, but unverified.

107
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,219
Would you just let us in?

108
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,472
Luckily for you,
this is not a nuclear reactor.

109
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,307
So, what'd you get the birthday boy?

110
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,435
Raj got him an awesome
limited-edition Dark Knight sculpture...

111
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,479
...based on Alex Ross'
definitive Batman.

112
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,566
And I got him this amazing autographed
copy of The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

113
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,112
Nice. I got him a sweater.

114
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,449
Okay, well, he might like that.
I've seen him get chilly.

115
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,620
- Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
- That's because I didn't bring one.

116
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,913
- Why not?
- Don't ask.

117
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,125
The entire institution of gift-giving
makes no sense.

118
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,461
- Too late.
- Let's say I go out and I spend $50 on you.

119
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,756
It's a laborious activity
because I have to imagine what you need...

120
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,508
...where you know what you need.

121
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,803
I could simplify things,
just give you the $50 directly...

122
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,806
...and then you could give me $50
on my birthday and so on...

123
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:17,102
...until one of us dies,
leaving the other one old and $50 richer.

124
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,398
And I ask you, is it worth it?

125
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,859
Told you not to ask.

126
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,696
Well, Sheldon, you're his friend.
Friends give each other presents.

127
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,323
I accept your premise,
I reject your conclusion.

128
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:36,037
Try telling him
it's a non-optional social convention.

129
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,832
- What?
- Just do it.

130

<font color="#E86CE4">(PENNY GROANS)</font>

131
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,296
It's a non-optional social convention.

132
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,382
Ah, fair enough.

133
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,554
He came with a manual.

134
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,391
Question, how am I going to get Leonard
a present before the party?

135
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,394
I don't drive and the things available
in walking distance...

136
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,396
...are a Thai restaurant
and a gas station.

137
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,734
I could wrap up an order of mee krob
and a couple of lottery scratchers.

138
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,404
Okay, let's do this.
I will drive Sheldon to get a present.

139
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,407
- Howard, get rid of Leonard for two hours.
- No problem.

140
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,911
And then, Raj, you bring the stuff
across the hall and start setting up.

141
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,331
- What if guests show up?
- Entertain them.

142
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,459
What if they're women?

143
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,004
Stare at them
and make them feel uncomfortable.

- Seen it.
- No.

150
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,738
You've seen
the 25th Anniversary Final Cut.

151
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,200
This one has eight seconds
of previously-unseen footage.

152
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,036
They say it completely changes
the tone of the film.

153
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,205
Pass.

154
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:04,918
Come on. Afterwards, there's a Q&A
with Harrison Ford's body double.

155
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,462
Look, I am in the "Halo" battle
of my life here.

156
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,215
There's this kid in Copenhagen,
he has no immune system.

157
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,468
So all he does is sit in his bubble
and play "Halo" 24/7.

158
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,887
Can't you play him some other time?

159
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,723
Not if you believe his doctors.

160
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,354
Oh, my God, do you smell gas?

161
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,315
- No.
- Yeah, no.

162
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,738
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
You know, they have DVDs over there.

163
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,409
Yes, but they have DVD burners
over here.

164
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,495
Leonard needs a DVD burner.

165
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,081
Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be
something someone needs.

166
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,499
It should be something fun.

167
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:49,379
- Something they wouldn't buy for themself.
- You mean, like a sweater?

168
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,594
Well, it's a fun sweater.
It's got a bold geometric print.

169
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,930
- Is it the geometry that makes it fun?
- Okay.

170
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,891
The point is, one of the ways
we show we care about people...

171
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,687
...is by putting thought and imagination
into the gifts we give them.

172
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,899
- Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.
- Exactly.

173
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:14,029
Something he wouldn't buy for himself,
something fun, something like... Ah!

174
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,157
An 802. 11n wireless router.

175
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,287
Here you go, Copenhagen boy.

176

00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,675
The laundry is out of the hamper.

194
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,098
Okay, Sheldon,
what was it supposed to be?

195
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,309
Fine, it's out of the washer.

196
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,937
I'll call you when it's in the dryer.

197
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,438

200
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,370
- What do you think?
- Um, that one.

201
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,373
- Because of the additional Ethernet ports?
- Sure.

202
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,209
He doesn't need them.
He's got a six-port Ethernet switch.

203

- Oh, okay, then this one.
- Why?

204

I don't know.
The man on the box looks so happy.

205
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,884
Penny, if I'm going to buy Leonard a gift,
I'm going to do it right.

206

the same childhood trauma I did.

I know I'm gonna regret this,
but what trauma?

208
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,730
On my 12th birthday,
I really wanted a titanium centrifuge...

209
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,733
...so, you know,
I could separate radioactive isotopes.

210
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,025
Of course, yeah.

211
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:20,196
Instead of a titanium centrifuge,
my parents bought me...

212
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,823
Wow, this is hard.

213
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,619
They got me a motorized dirt bike.

214
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,414
No.

215
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,585
What 12-year-old boy
wants a motorized dirt bike?

216
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,754
All of them.

217
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,422

- Yeah.

218
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,258

- Yeah, I suppose.

220
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,846
All right, let's go.

221
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,766
Excuse me,
do you know anything about this stuff?

222
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,143
I know everything about this stuff.

223
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,937
Okay, I have my own
wholesale flower business.

224
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,106
I wanna hook up my computer
in the front...

225
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,275
...with the one
in my refrigerated warehouse.

Buy this one, it's the one we're getting.
Happy guy.

No, she doesn't want that.

228
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:05,617
She needs a point-to-point peer network
with a range extender.

229
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,328
- Thank you.
- Which hard drive do I want?

230
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:12,791
- FireWire or USB?
- It depends on what bus you have available.

231
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,547
I drive a Chevy Cavalier.

232
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,008
Oh, dear Lord.

233
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,677
- We have to go.
- Not now, this poor man needs me.

What computer do you have,
and please don't say a white one.

236
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,900
- Excuse me.
- Fill this out and have a seat.

237
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,361
We're throwing
my friend a surprise party...

238
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,863
...and I'm supposed to keep him out
for two hours.

239
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,157
Uh-huh. Fill this out and have a seat.

240
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,118
The way I could get him
to leave was tell him I ate a peanut.

241
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,995
I'm allergic to peanuts.

242
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,415
Well, in that case,
fill this out and have a seat.

243
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,710
All I need from you
is to give me a BAND-AID.

244
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,379
I can pretend I had epinephrine.

245
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,549
Tell my friend you need to keep me
under observation for an hour.

246
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,008
- Is that all you need?
- Yes.

247
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,760
Get out of my ER.

248
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,429
- No, you don't understand.
- I understand.

249
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,350
But unfortunately, this hospital
is not equipped to treat stupid.

250

Okay, I get it.
I know how the world works.

How about if I were to introduce you
to the man who freed your people?

252
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,533
Unless my people were freed
by Benjamin Franklin...

253
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,452
...and his five twin brothers,

like you're swelling up.

257

We should pick up Benadryl
at the drugstore and go home.

258
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,924
- We can't go home.
- Why not?

264
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,112

- I don't think I can.

265
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,740
You have to.
We all have to be there to yell "surprise."

266

You have to understand something.
We're in a hospital right now.

267
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,244
Why? Is Leonard okay?

268
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,956
Leonard's fine. I'm fine,
thanks for asking, by the way.

269
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,335
Okay, I don't need your attitude.
Just hold him there a little longer.

270

I've done my best, but he wants to go home
and I don't know how to stop him.

00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,506
Okay, how about this?

272
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,884

00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,305
Okay, where were we?

27
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:42,059
Not now. I have a blog to find.

28
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,507
Penny, are you okay?

29
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,885
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
I'm fine, Leonard. Just go away.

30
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,472
I understand that breaking up
with someone can be very painful...

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,559
- Go away!
- Okay, feel better, bye.

32
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,274
She doesn't wanna talk.

33
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,776
Not surprising.

34
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:37,406
Penny's emotional responses originate in the
primitive portion of brain, the amygdala.

35
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,367
While speech is centered
in the recently developed neocortex.

36
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,328
Former can overpower the latter
giving scientific credence...

37
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,331
...to the notion
of being rendered speechless.

38
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,964
Or maybe she just doesn't wanna talk.

39
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,510
Hey, look, I found an iPod.

40
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,309
It's smashed beyond repair.
What are you gonna do with it?

41
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,188
What else?
Sell it on eBay as slightly used.

42
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,982
It was Penny's boyfriend's.
They broke up.

43
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,028
Apparently, he posted intimate details
of their physical relationship on his blog...

44
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,239
...which I cannot find anywhere.

45
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,910
You know what? I'm gonna go back
and try talking to her again.

46
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,121
Good idea.
Sit with her, hold her, comfort her.

47
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,500
And if the moment feels right,
see if you can cop a feel.

48
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,921
I'm not going to do that, Howard.

49
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,883
I'm not aware of any social convention
that requires you to intervene at all.

50
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,843
What about damsel in distress?

51
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,639
Twelfth-century code of chivalry?
Not exactly current.

52
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,767
You'd also have to be knighted
for that to apply.

53
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,853
I don't care.
She's upset, I'm going over there.

54
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,398
Remember to sit on your hands a bit
so they're warm.

55
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,819
I'm her friend. I'm not going
to take advantage of her vulnerability.

56
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:02,241
So you're saying, if in the depths of despair
she throws herself at you...

57
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,036
...and demands you take her right there,
right now, you'll just walk away?

58
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,665
I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.

<font color="#E86CE4">(KNOCKING ON DOOR)</font>

60
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,505
Hey, I know you said
you didn't wanna talk...

61
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,215
- I don't.
- Okay, sorry.

62
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,301
- Wait.
- Wait. Did you say wait?

63
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,805
Tell me the truth.

64
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,058
Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?

65
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,685
No, no.

66
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,397
Okay, so I pick good guys,
but turn them into losers?

67
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,606
Of course not.

68
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,734
Well, it's gotta be one or the other.
Which is it?

69
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,993
I'm sorry. What were the choices again?

70
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,287
I really thought Mike was different.

71
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,540
I thought he was sensitive and smart.

72
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,708
I mean, not you smart.

73
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,044
- Normal non-freaky smart.
- Yeah, no, sure.

74
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,880
You know, and then he just goes
and has to humiliate me...

75
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,676
...by writing about me on his blog
so the entire world can read it.

76
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,928
Actually, it's not all that easy to find.

77
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,557
Yeah, really? Well, my friends at work
found it, my sister found it.

78
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:13,770
Judging by my e-mail, a number of prisoners
at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.

79
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,897
What exactly did this guy write?

80
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,650
Not that I need to know
the details of your sex life.

81
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,027
I just thought...

82
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,112
Never mind.

83
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,072
No, you know what?

84
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,451
Might as well read it,
everybody else has. Go ahead.

85
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:31,038
Oh, God, I just feel so betrayed
and embarrassed.

86
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,499
I just wanna crawl into a hole and die.

87
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,172
Okay, well, you know, this isn't that bad.

88
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,800
It just paints the picture
of a very affectionate woman...

89
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:49,306
...who's open to expressing her affection
in nontraditional locales.

90
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,308
Oh, God.

91
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:56,605
Elevators, parks, movie theaters.

92
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,899
Out of curiosity...

93
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,236
...is this subway, the transportation system,
or Subway, the sandwich shop?

94
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,239
Sandwich shop.

95
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,659
Doesn't that violate
the health code or...?

96
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,204
No, at the sub shop,
we were only making out.

97
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,289
Ah, okay.

98
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,919
But my point is that you have absolutely
no reason to be embarrassed.

99
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,297
Really? Do you think I overreacted?

100
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,467
- Maybe a little.
- Because I do that, I do overreact.

101
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,011
- Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.
- No, no.

102
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,722
No, that would be under-reacting.

103
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,476
He did break the implied confidentiality
of the bedroom...

104
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,855
...and in your case, the elevator,
parks and fast-food franchise.

105
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,565
Yes, you're right.

106
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,859
I should just say I am done with him.

107
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,820
Yes you should. Go ahead, say it.

108
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,073
But I never gave the man a chance
to explain.

109
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,243
What is there to explain?
It's all right here.

110
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,370
It's betrayal.

111
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,789
No, you were right the first time.

112
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,791
This is a man who loves me...

113
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,504
...but in his own stupid way was just trying
to show people how he feels.

114
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,091
I'm pretty sure I never said that.

115
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,761
No, you did better than that.
You helped me see it on my own.

116
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,304
Oh, good for me.

117
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,642
- Where are you going?
- I'm going over to Mike's.

118
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,603
- Leonard, thank you so much.
- Oh, sure.

119
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,193
Huh.

120
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,696
Maybe I am her gay friend.

121
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,538
Howard, I'm going
to need another Mandarin lesson.

122
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,125
I obviously didn't make my point
with those people.

123
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,211
For God's sake,
if you don't like tangerine chicken...

124
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,921
...don't order tangerine chicken.

125
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,300
I like tangerine chicken.
I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.

126
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,471
- Can we please change the subject?
- Sure.

127
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,892
Tell us again how you screwed up and got
Penny back together with her old boyfriend.

128
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,103
Just roll the dice.

129
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,902
"Enslaved by warlocks.
Stay here till you roll two, four or..."

130
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,778
She was mad at him.

131
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,282
She was done with him,
the relationship was broken...

132
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,660
...and I walked over there and I fixed it.

133
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,623
Boy, that story gets better
every time you hear it.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,752
I thought the first two renditions
were far more compelling.

135
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,421
Previously, I felt sympathy
for the Leonard character.

136
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,591
Now I just find him
to be whiny and annoying.

137
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,969
Just eat your tangerine chicken.

138
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:36,014
I'd love to,
but I don't have tangerine chicken.

139
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,437
Thank you so much
for your stupid advice.

140
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,860

Well, I went over to Mike's
to make up with him...

00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,632
Yeah, no, I know that part.

148
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,093
But he had already moved on.

149
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,011
Already? That was quick.

150
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:20,058
That's what I said to the woman
who had her legs wrapped around his neck.

Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.

How could he do that?

153
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,318
Oh, you know,
you did throw an 80-gig iPod...

154
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,362
Yeah, no, how could he do that?

155

is you know Leonard the best.

195
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,446
Not necessarily. I'm often surprised
by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.

196
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:43,618
Just the other day, I discovered
he not only has a loofah, he hides it.

197
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,579
Why do you suppose a man
would be ashamed of having a loofah?

198
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,166
I myself prefer to have my excess
epithelial cells slough off naturally...

199
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,628
...but I don't condemn those
who seek to accelerate the process.

200
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,466
And until recently, I had no idea
that despite his lactose intolerance...

201
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,136
...he can tolerate small amounts
of nonfat ice cream...

202
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,221
...without producing a noxious gas...

203
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,766
...that, I maintain, in the right concentration
could be weaponized.

204
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,270
Leonard might come home.
Can we talk in my apartment?

205
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,689
We're not done?

206
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,317
- No.
- Eh, why not?

207
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,320
We're already through
the looking glass anyway.

208
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,285
Okay, so here's the thing.

209
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,413
I guess you're aware
that Leonard asked me out.

210
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,331
Well, he didn't actually say anything.

211
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,418
But when he came back to the apartment,
he was doing a dance...

212
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,504
...that brought to mind
the happy hippos in Fantasia.

213
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,090
Oh, that's nice.

214
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,509
Anyhow,
the thing I wanted to talk to about is...

215
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,054
...you know, since Leonard
and I have become friends, I was just...

216
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,264
Wanna sit down?

217
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,267
Oh, I wish it were that simple.

218
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,689
You see, I don't spend much time here,
and so I've never chosen a place to sit.

219
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,775
Well, choose.

220
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,944
There are a number of options and...

221
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,906
I'm really not familiar enough
with the cushion densities...

222
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:07,118
...air-flow patterns and dispersion
of sunlight to make an informed choice.

223
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,039
Why don't you pick at random, if you
don't like it, sit somewhere else next time?

224
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,208
No, no, that's crazy.

225
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,046
You go ahead and talk
while I figure it out.

226
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,964
Okay.

227
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,467
Here's the thing.

228
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,971
So I've known for a while now
that Leonard has had a little crush on me...

229
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,890
A little crush?

230
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,475
Well, I suppose so.

231
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,479
In the same way Menelaus
had a little crush on Helen of Troy.

232
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,357
I don't really know who they are...

233
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,902
- Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon...
- Yeah, I don't care. Listen.

234
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,737
The point is...

235
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,657
...Leonard isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

236
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,285
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

237
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,081
Would you be open
to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

238
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,710
No. What I'm saying is,
Leonard might be different in a good way.

239
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,256
And obviously, my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

240
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:05,593
Your last one worked out well
for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod.

241
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,222
Oh, glare.

242
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,765
But on the other hand...

243
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,435
...if things don't go well with Leonard,
I risk losing a really good friend.

244
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,354
I mean, he's not looking for a fling.

245
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,483
He's the kind that gets into a relationship
for, like you would say, light-years.

246
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,776
I would not say that.

247
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,573
No one would say that.
A light-year is a unit of distance, not time.

248
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,783
Thank you for the clarification.

249
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,584
Draft.

250
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,337
You see, people hear the word "year"
and they think duration.

251
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:45,049
Foot-pound has the same problem.
That's a unit of work, not of weight.

252
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,384
Right. Thanks.

253
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,013
- It's a common mistake.
- Not the first one I've made today.

254
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,723
Okay.

255
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,018
I think this will be my seat.

256
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,854
Do you have anything to say
that has anything to do...

257
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,064
...with, you know,
what I'm talking about?

258
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,650
Well, let's see.

259
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,153
We might consider Schrödinger's cat.

260
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,406
Schrödinger. Is that the woman in 2A?

261
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,824
No, that's Mrs. Grossinger.

262
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,494
She doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican
hairless. Annoying little animal. Yip-yip-yip.

263
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,163
Sheldon.

264
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,665
Sorry, you diverted me.

265
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:22,253
Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrödinger,
in an attempt to explain...

266
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,090
...the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
physics, he proposed an experiment.

267
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,886
A cat is placed in a box
with a sealed vial of poison...

268
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,971
...that will break open at a random time.

269
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,934
Now, since no one knows
when or if the poison has been released...

270
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:41,606
...until the box is opened, the cat
can be thought of as both alive and dead.

271
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,196
I'm sorry, I don't get the point.

272
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,407
Well, of course you don't get it.
I haven't made it yet.

273
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,161
You have to be psychic,
there's no such thing...

274
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,871
Sheldon, what's the point?

275
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,708
Just like Schrödinger's cat,
your potential relationship with Leonard...

276
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,544
...right now
can be thought of as both good and bad.

277
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,674
It is only by opening the box
that you'll find out which it is.

278
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,386
Okay, so you're saying
I should go out with Leonard?

279
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,554
No, no, no.

280
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,142
Let me start again.
In 1935, Erwin Schrödinger...

281
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,355
Two seats right there.

282
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,693
<font color="#E86CE4">(SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)</font>

283
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,077
Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.

284
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,621
I can see that.
Unless you're running a marathon...

285
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,917
...choosing both stuffing and mashed
potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy.

286
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,836
No, it's about Penny.

287
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,797
A mistake involving Penny.

288
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,008
Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.

289
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,219
I don't think
I can go out with her tonight.

290
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,721
Then don't.

291
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,223
Other people would say, "Why not?"

292
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,600
Other people might be interested.

293
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,980
- I'm gonna talk anyway.
- I assumed you would.

294
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,569
Now that I'm actually about to go out
with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.

295
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,529
Then your meal choice is appropriate.

296
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,780
Starch absorbs fluid...

297
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,576
...which reduces the amount
of vomit available for violent expulsion.

298
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,620
- Right.
- You also made a grammatical mistake.

299
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,206
You said "nauseous"
when you meant "nauseated."

300
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,876
But go on.

301
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,129
Sheldon, this date
is probably my one chance with Penny.

302
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,630
What happens if I blow it?

303
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,677
Well, if we accept your premise and also
accept the highly improbable assumption...

304
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,430
...that Penny is the only woman
in the world for you...

305
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,391
...we can logically conclude
that the result of blowing it...

306
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,811
...would be that you end up a lonely,
bitter old man with no progeny.

307
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,397
The image of any number
of evil lighthouse keepers...

308
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,900
...from Scooby-Doo cartoons
comes to mind.

309
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,985
You're not helping.

310
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,945
All right, what response on my part...

311
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,406
...would bring this conversation
to a conclusion?

312
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,159
Tell me whether or not
to go through with the date.

313
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,744
Schrödinger's cat.

314
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,955
Wow, that's brilliant.

315
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,750
You sound surprised.

316
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,212

Oh.

Okay.

328
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:56,050
But before you say anything,
have you ever heard of Schrödinger's cat?

329
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,140
Actually, I've heard
far too much about Schrödinger's cat.

330
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,433
Good.
