Problem?

This is the worst cobbler
I've ever eaten.

It tastes like it's made of
actual ground-up shoemaker.

Amusing. A play on the
two meanings of "cobbler."

Hey, guys. Guess who
I found at LAX?

My baby sister Priya.

Excuse me, I object.

You propose a guessing game,

yet you don't give me
enough time to guess.

For the record,
I was going to say:

"Your sister Priya."

Oh, Sheldon. You haven't
changed a bit, have you?

Why would I change?

The hope has been that

you'd eventually bend
to public opinion.

So, Priya, what brings
you back to L.A.?

I have a one-day layover
on my way to Toronto.

Corporate merger.

Can you believe it?

Little Priya's one
of the lead attorneys

for the biggest
car company in India.

Given that when we met her,
she was finishing law school

and planning an internship
at a large Indian car company,

it's actually
extremely plausible.

And your poll numbers
just keep dropping.

I want to catch up
with all of you,

but first I really
must visit the loo.

I'm going, too; I'll
show you where it is.

All right, this goes
without saying,

but I'm just going
to say it anyway.

Hands off my sister.

Why would I touch her? She's
covered with airplane germs.

I'm so not talking to you.
I'm talking to him.

Hey. I've got a girlfriend now.
Oh, please.

My sister's much hotter

than your girlfriend,
and you know it.

Let's just agree
they're both hot.

But dude, that's my sister
you're talking about!

Okay, forget who's hotter.

The first time Priya came to
L.A., Leonard and I made a pact

out of respect to our
friendship and to you

that neither of us
would hit on her.

Did you pinky-swear?

Yes.

Okay, then.

Cobbler. I'm still laughing.

It's really nice
to see you again, Leonard.

Yeah. It's good
to see you, too.

Here you go.

Thanks.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Okay.

 


So you got any special plans
with your sister?

Oh, not really. Just hang out.

I always tell people,
"If you have only one day

in Los Angeles,
make it a train day."

Train day?

The fun starts with brunch
at Carney's in Studio City,

a hotdog stand in a
converted railroad dining car.

Next stop, Travel Town,

an outdoor museum featuring
43 railroad engines,

cars, and other rolling stock
from the 1880s to the 1930s.

And, finally, we're off to the
glitz and glamour of Hollywood,

for dinner at--that's right--
the Hollywood Carney's,

a hotdog stand in a different
converted railroad dining car.

I don't think
we're going to do that.

Well, then apparently
you hate fun.

Priya's not back yet?

Well, I guess
that's not unusual.

Women, men, the whole
sitting-standing deal.

So what are we talking about?

Uh, my plans
with Priya.

He rejected Train Day.

Did you make it clear that
it's two different train cars

turned into hotdog stands?

Abundantly.

I guess he just hates fun.

That's what I said!

Okay, so... what's
new with you guys?

I have a girlfriend now.

Hey, good for you!

Yeah, I just want
to put it out there

in case I inadvertently

squirt any pheromones
in your direction.

Happy?

So, Priya, what are your
plans while you're here?

I don't know. I just
have the one day.

Do you like trains?

Not particularly.

You might as well just wait
at the airport for your flight.

"You are in a forest.

"There is quicksand to the west,

a path leads to the east."

Go east.

"An iron gate blocks your way."

Open gate.

"It's locked."

Hmm.

Well, so much for that.

It's getting pretty late.
How come you're still up?

I found an emulator online that
lets you play classic text-based

computer games from the 1980s.

That's pretty cool.

Oh, yes. It runs on the world's
most powerful graphics chip:

imagination.

You've really got
to get out more.

Go north.

"You can't go that way."

Go west.

"A troll blocks your passage."

Okay. Fasten your seatbelts.

Kill troll.

"With what?"

With sword.

"You don't have the sword."

Good golly, it's as if
it's actually happening to me.

Raj finally went to bed.

Sheldon's still up.

You said he goes
to bed at 9:00.

Yeah, he does, but he got caught
up in a computer game and...

Hit troll with axe!

Hit troll with axe!

Hit troll with axe!

My, this is one tough troll.

Can't you get rid of him?

If the past is any
indication, no.

Leonard, I'm trapped
in quicksand!

The axe is dragging me down!

Drop axe!

Drop axe, brilliant!

Give me a minute.

Sheldon.

Hold on.

Trying to figure out

how to get the bucket,

so I can carry the mud
past the dragon.

Sheldon, you need to
work in the morning.

I know!

Well, then bed, mister!

Five more minutes!

Really?

You're going to risk getting
sleepy in the middle of your

thermodynamic
fluctuations seminar?

You know what happens
when you yawn in public.

Everyone will see
my oddly shaped uvula.

You don't want that, do you?

No.

But it's a shame our society
mocks the differently uvulated.

Who was at the door?

Uh, building manager.

They have to fix a pipe,

so the water'll be off
tomorrow from noon to 2:00.

That's unacceptable.

We're supposed to be
given written notice.

Well, no, it doesn't matter--
we'll be at work.

What if I spill tomato
soup on my shirt,

and have to come home to change,

only to find there's no water
for an enzyme soak?

Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!

I'll have the chicken noodle.
Good night!

We're going
to have to be very quiet.

I know how to
get the bucket!

I can turn the axe around

and use the handle to reach it.

Let's see.

Go north.

"You are in a forest."

Go north.

"You are in a forest."

Go north.

"You are in a forest."
Oh dear, I believe I'm lost.

Well, I'll just have to get
a fresh start tomorrow.

No, no, no! You just
took a wrong turn.

You just need to map it out.

Come on, I'll help you.

So you stopped at the stream,

and you turned
north three times?

Yes.

You're right.
You're lost. Good luck.

Oh!

Leonard. Wake up.

Huh? Wh-- Sorry.

For what?

I don't know. When I'm in bed
with a girl, it's just--

it's my go-to response.

It's 6:00. I have
to get back to Raj's

before he wakes up
and realizes I'm gone.

Oh. Right. Sure.

I wish you could stay
in L.A. a while longer.

Mmm, me, too.

You know, I was thinking:

There are some great
research facilities in India.

Where are you going
with this, Leonard?

Well, I'm just saying, you know,
I don't have any real ties here,

so if I were to move to New
Delhi, we could, you know--

go out.

Leonard, didn't we have this
conversation five years ago?

Well, yes, but...

things have changed.

You know, you're older,
I'm older--

Look, no more
superhero bed sheets.

Sweetheart,

just because we have fun when
I come to town doesn't mean

I want to have a
serious relationship.

It doesn't?

Mm-mm.

And besides, I could never bring
a white boy home to my parents.

They'd have a cow.

Which is a much
bigger deal in India.

I'm not that white.

My great-great-grandmother
was half Cherokee.

I know that's not the right kind
of Indian, but it is something.

You're funny.

Leonard?

Leonard?

Leonard?

What?

I heard a woman laughing.

Oh, uh, yeah. I was trying to
see if I could laugh as a woman.

Oh! Well, good job.
Quite convincing.

I smell perfume.

Air freshener.

And is that lipstick
on your cheek and neck?

Rash. That's a bad rash.

My sympathies.

I'm no stranger to the crimson
scourge that is dermatitis.

Can I interest you
in a topical steroid

from my lotion and
unguent collection?

Uh, yeah, yeah,
that sounds great.

Very well. I'm sure
I can find something

that will help
you ditch that itch.

Okay, he's in the
bathroom. Let's go.

Do you prefer
ointment or cream?

Cream.

With or without a numbing agent?

Without.

Really, Leonard?

There are no heroes when
it comes to dermatitis.

Fine. With.

Prescription or
non-prescription strength?

Use your best judgment.

Well, I think I have a
nice 2009 AnaMantle HC.

It's usually indicated for
acutely inflamed hemorrhoids,

but it also goes nicely
with non-mucosal body parts.

Sounds great.

Excellent choice.

Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry.

Come on, come on, come on.

Priya?

Good morning, Sheldon.

For shame, Leonard, for shame.

And to think,

I was ready to waste

the last of my good
hemorrhoid cream on you.

Making pretty
good time, huh?

Is that really what you want
to talk about, Leonard?

No.

What do you want to talk about?

Please don't tell anyone

I spent the night
with Raj's sister.

There it is.

What if someone asks?

No one's going to ask if I spent
the night with Raj's sister.

Perhaps, but they might ask me
something else.

Like what?
Like

"Has Leonard betrayed any
of his friends recently?"

Priya and I are both adults.

I didn't betray Raj.

In fact, you did,
but I was referring to Howard.

What are you talking about?

April 12, 2005.

Bob's Big Boy,
Toluca Lake.

Raj had just introduced us
to Priya for the first time.

She was enjoying the sweet taste
of Hindu rebellion

in the form of a Bob's
Super Big Boy hamburger.

In order
to preserve

your friendship, you and Howard
made a pinky swear

that neither of you
would attempt to woo her.

I had a patty melt.

Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.

And Raj.
All right, and Raj.

And me.

You?

Violation of the
Roommate Agreement's

overnight guest
notification clause.

Okay, fine,
I-I'm a horrible human being.

I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.

You're far too short
to be Darth Vader.

At best you might be
a turncoat Ewok.

My point is: Priya's gone
and it would be much better

if no one else found out
about us.

You mean you want me
to keep a secret?

Yes.

You know I can't
keep a secret.

You can if you try.

Think about
it this way:

um, if I were Batman
and you were Alfred,

you'd keep that
secret, right?

Why do you get
to be Batman?

Because Batman has the secret.

Alfred has secrets, too.

Like what?
Alfred knows

that Barbara Gordon
is Batgirl.

Which I've now just
told to Batman.

See, I cannot
keep a secret.

Ta-dah!

What?

Ta-dah.

It's short for...

 Da-da-da-da! 

Kind of busy here, Sheldon.

I know,
that's why I shortened it.

What do you want?

I came to go over your alibi
for last night.

What alibi?

You've asked me

to lie on your behalf,
and as you know,

I am deeply uncomfortable
with impromptu dishonesty,

so I've provided you

with an ironclad alibi.

You couldn't have spent
last night with Priya

because you were
with another woman.

Oh, I'm so sure
I'm gonna regret this,

but who was I with?

The fun-loving and morally loose
Miss Maggie McGarry.

Oh, God.

You met her at Pasadena's most
popular Irish watering hole,

Lucky Baldwin's, where Maggie
spends her nights tending bar

with a head full of curls
and a heart full of dreams.

"Leonard, call me if you
are interested in coitus.

Sincerely,
Maggie McGarry."

And if anyone were

to actually call that number,
they will hear this.

FEMALE TEXT-TO-SPEECH VOICE:
Top of the morning to you.

You've reached Maggie McGarry.

Leave a message
after the wee little beep.

It's pretty convincing, huh?

That wasn't even
a real person.

And here is
the clincher:

a lock of Maggie's
flaming auburn hair.

Where'd you get that?

From an orangutan
in the primate lab.

An orangutan?

Well, no one's going

to run a DNA test
on it, Leonard.

Honestly, you overthink
everything.

Sheldon, I don't need an alibi.

Nobody's going to ask
about last night

as long as you just
zip your lip.

Thank you.

Now, don't worry,
everything is going to be fine.

Hey.

Hey, Leonard, will you
please tell Howard

my sister has never
been attracted to him?

Come on, Raj,

how am I supposed to know

who she is attracted to
or was attracted to

or who she might be
attracted to in the future?

And I have nothing
to contribute

to this conversation.

Because I, too,
know absolutely nothing

about Priya's preferences
in male companionship.

And with that,
I will re-zip my lip.

Hey, so what did
you guys think

of the new episode
of Caprica last night?

I didn't see it.

Didn't see it?

What were you doing?

Uh, I was out.

What, on Caprica night?

Yeah, I, uh, went
for a drink.

Really, you?

Where, w-where'd
you go?

To, uh...

Lucky Baldwin's.

Oh, I've heard
of that place.

Isn't that Pasadena's
favorite Irish watering hole?

Yes.

Did you meet

anyone interesting there,

perhaps a promiscuous,
redheaded barmaid?

As a matter of fact...
I-I-I-I-I can't, I can't,

I can't do it.

Sure you can, you're doing
fine, it's very believable.

I'm sorry, Raj,
but the truth is,

I was with Priya
last night.

Don't listen to him.

He's still light-headed
from all the Irish whiskey

and pickled eggs
in his system.

What were you doing
with Priya?

I believe they engaged
in coitus,

but more
importantly,

if Leonard had not abandoned
his story,

would you have found it
plausible?

You slept with my sister?!

Yeah.

How could you?
We had a pact.

Excuse me, I think
"How could you? She's my sister"

takes precedence over
a five-year-old pinky swear.

May I point out,

in a parallel universe,
your friends are saying

"Maggie McGarry--
she sounds lovely."

Look, I-I admit it, I may
have crossed a line here,

but come on, Raj, your
sister is a grown woman,

and to her, I'm a forbidden
piece of white chocolate.

I don't believe it.

This is a terrible
betrayal of my trust.

No, w-w-would it
help if I told you

that I offered her my heart,
and she kind of stomped on it?

How hard did she stomp?

Very hard.

Okay, I'm good.

Well, Raj,

I just want to say that I'd
never betray your trust.

Unlike Leonard,
I respect you.

Really?

Mm-hmm.

Was it out of respect
that you didn't tell Raj

about the time you dropped
his iPhone in a urinal?

Dude, I put that thing
on my face!

I think a more amusing
violation of Raj's trust

is when Howard convinced him
that foreigners give presents

to Americans
on Thanksgiving.

Hey, I didn't see
you giving back

your Snoopy
snow cone maker.

That was all a lie?

This year's gifts
are already wrapped.

And as long as we're talking
about betraying our friends,

how about the month Sheldon
spent grinding up insects

and mixing them
into Leonard's food?

Well, excuse me.

That was not a betrayal.

That was an experiment
to determine

at what concentration
food starts tasting "mothy."

You put moths in my food?!

For science.

I can't believe you kissed
my sister with moth mouth.

Well, I can't believe you
used Sheldon's toothbrush.

You used my toothbrush?

Not the brush part,
just the little rubber thing

to pick food from my teeth
and massage my gums.

Okay, I-I think
it's safe to say

that we've all done
some things

we're not
particularly proud of.

But come on,
we're friends.

Friends overlook
each other's minor lapses.

For the record, Howard, I'm
sorry that I broke our pact.

Thank you.

And I'm sorry
about your phone

and Thanksgiving.

And while we're at it,

you don't have to wash our
clothes on the Fourth of July.

As long as we're apologizing,

Sheldon, I'm, I'm sorry
I used your toothbrush.

And I'm sorry...

but that behavior
is beyond the pale

and cannot be tolerated.

We are no longer friends.

I got you a talking Thomas the
Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.

With real puffing smoke?

Yes.

All right.

But I'm watching you.

Hey, you've got Snoopy out.

Can I have a snow cone?

Well, sure.

This is pretty good.

What flavor is this?

Guess.

Papaya?
No.

Guava?
You're so close.

I give up.

Mango caterpillar.

What are
you doing?!

You said you
liked it.




 Hey.
 Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?

Yeah. Got 8 pounds of salmon
that's about to go bad.

 Do you know how to cook it?
 Not really.

Should've liberated the iffy chicken.

So, what are you
and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?

Star Wars on Blu-ray.

Haven't you seen that movie
a thousand times?

Not on Blu-ray.

Only twice on Blu-ray.

Oh, Leonard. Ugh.

I know. It's high-resolution sadness.

Well, I was gonna take myself out
to a movie tonight.

You wanna go?

 Really? Do we do that?
 What do you mean?

You know, we haven't spent time alone
together since we broke up.

It's not a date, Leonard.
It's a man and a woman hanging out...

not having sex
at the end of the night.

Sounds like most of my dates.

Get away from me, you monster.

What is that about?

He's smart and crazy enough.
He may have actually created a monster.

Shoo, shoo.

Be gone.

What the hell is going on?

There's a bird outside the window
and he won't go away.

That is the hell that is going on.

We have no worms or seeds here.
Shoo, shoo.

Really? On top of everything else,
you're afraid of birds?

It's called ornithophobia, and someday it
will be recognized as a true disability...

and the landlord will be required by
law to put a giant net over the building.

Which is unfortunate,
because I have a fear of nets.

So movies, yes or no?

 Oh, movies, yes.

Great. I'll see you later.
And remember, he's more afraid of you...

 ...than you are of him.
 That doesn't help.

Oh.

I was talking to the bird.


Go away, bird. Go away, bird.
Go away, bird.

Sheldon, just ignore him.

Good idea.
Attention is what birds want.

Oh.

Much better. All right.

Now I'll just get along with my life.


Make a pot of tea, Leonard,
it's gonna be a long night.



Bird still there?

 Quick, what does a hawk sound like?
 I don't know, uh...

Scree, scree.

Please, that's a seagull.
If you're not going to help, don't help.

Sorry. Hey, do you think
I'm over-dressed?

Uh, it depends on the activity.
For a prostate exam, yes.

If you're playing Vegas,
I'd add sequins.

I'm going to the movies with Penny.

I don't want her to think
I think it's a date.

 Do you think it's a date?
 No.

But she might think I think it's a date,
even though I don't.

Or you think she thinks
you think it's a date.

 Are we over-thinking this?
 Not at all.

 You're right. I'm fine. I'm wearing this.
 Really? A blazer? All right.

Yes, hello.
Uh, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

I'm at 2311
North Los Robles Avenue.

I'd like to report
a dangerous wild animal.

A blue jay.

I'm sorry, this is Animal Control.
I don't understand the laughter.

No, the bird is not in my home.

If he was in my home,
I obviously would've called 911.

I have no doubt that there are things
that you're frightened of.

Uh, being stuck in a dead-end
public service job.

Or your wife stepping out on you...

because you're stuck
in a dead-end public service job.

Or spiders.

Don't you think
I tried making cat noises?

Too casual?

For an audience with the Queen, yes.

For an evening of passing a bottle
of fortified wine around a trash can...

you look great.


What am I thinking? Whiskers.

Oh, hey, if we hurry we can make
the Jennifer Aniston movie.

Oh, yeah, sure.

Yeah, uh,
there's also an amazing documentary...

about building a dam on a river
in South America.

Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie
has Jennifer Aniston.

And she's not building a dam.

 Can't argue with that. I'll get the tickets.
 Okay.

Actually, you know what?

I think it's about time
I pick a movie we see.

Wha...? You picked plenty of movies.

No, you always picked
and it was always the same.

An hour and a half of beach houses...

until the woman turns around
and realizes love was here all along.

Come on, that is a great movie.
And it starts in ten minutes.

But I hate those movies.

 No, you don't.
 Yes, I do.

The only reason I went is because you
wanted to see them and I wanted sex.

To this day I can't see
a Sandra Bullock poster...

without getting both bored
and aroused.

So while we were going out,
how often would you pretend...

to like things
just to have sex with me?

All the time.

You're kidding.

Does this sound familiar?

"I'd love to go
shoe shopping with you."

"Hiking, it's great."

"it's 2 a.m., of course,
I wanna go to Koreatown...

and sing karaoke with your friends.
Who wouldn't?"

Okay. We were going out.
You were gonna get sex anyway.

Really? You would've slept with me after
a three hour documentary on dams?

No. No woman would.

See, now, that's the great thing.
We're out as friends.

This is not a date. Sex is off the table.

So let's go learn
why hydroelectric power...

might not be the environmental
bargain you think it is.

Sorry, spoiler alert.

 Ugh. All right. Fine.
 Thanks.

Uh, tickets are 11 bucks.

Not a date.

Come on, Sheldon. Star Wars.

I'm pushing play. I mean it.

Yeah, if we don't start soon,
George Lucas is gonna change it again.

This would go a lot faster
if you put your diploma to work...

and help me set up this high-frequency
tone generator.

I have a master's degree from MIT.

Yeah, but you've got a can-do attitude,
and that's what's important.

I really don't get your problem
with birds.

The question you should be asking is,
what is their problem with me?

My first memory, a hummingbird
dive-bombing my stroller...

to get at the apple juice
in my sippy cup.

Hummingbirds are pretty.

Hummingbirds are the vampires
of the flower world.

Still my first choice
for an ankle tattoo.

Or a dolphin. I go back and forth.

Age 7, a blood-thirsty chicken
chases me up a tree.

Age 12, a magpie tries to steal
the retainer out of my mouth.

Age 16, a parrot in a pet store
calls me fat ass.

Need I go on?

Yes, please.
This is way better than the movie, heh.

All right, Sheldon.
Your bird death ray is ready.

It's not a death ray. It's just a little
ultrasonic blast to scare him off.

Trust me, if I had a death ray,
I wouldn't be living here.

I'd be in my lair enjoying the money
the people of Earth gave me...

for not using my death ray.

All right. And in three, two, one.


That is one tough birdie.

Come on, you enjoyed the movie.

I saw you tearing up when the village
flooded and everyone had to relocate.

No, I was thinking how come
they get to leave and I can't.


I'm gonna get some fries.
You want anything?

 Uh, no, thanks.
 Are you sure?

Because you always say no,
and then you eat half my fries.

I just eat the little crispy ones
you don't like.

No, I love them. I save them for the end,
but they're gone because you ate them.

And why did I let you eat them?

 To get sex.
 Exactly.

But this is not a date.

So I ask again.
Would you like anything?

 All right. I'd like an order of fries.
 Great. That'll be 5 dollars.

I am having the best time.

I'm so glad you suggested we do this.

 Oh. Sorry.
 No problem.

 What you writing there?
 Uh, a screenplay.

It's about a guy whose roommate is
having sex and tells him to go...

and work on his screenplay.


 It's a working title.
 Oh. Ha, ha.

 I'm Kevin.
 Oh, Penny.

Nice to meet you.

 I'll let you get back to your date.
 Oh, no, no. This isn't a date. No.

Right?

Uh, right.

So have you written anything
I might have seen?

That depends.
How much time do you spend on Yelp?



This is ridiculous.

I'm a grown man from Texas.

This isn't a terrifying bird
like a swan or a goose.

It's just a blue jay.

That's a pretty big blue jay.

One, two, three.

Go. Shoo.


Bird in the apartment.
Bird in the apartment.

No!

So it is an amazing documentary.

They need electricity from the dam...

but at the same time,
they wanna preserve the environment.

You're kidding me.

 Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?
 Oh, sure. Just one sec?

No problem.

 What's up?
 I know what you're doing.

 What?
 You're going to talk to that guy...

 ...because I said we weren't on a date.
 I'm talking to him because he's cute.

 Uh, come on. He's not that cute.
 Yes, he is...

with his dorky T-shirt
and his little hipster glasses.

I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.

Yes, but when you're tall and have great
cheekbones, you're doing it ironically.

 So, what if I start talking to a girl?
 You should.

 Yeah, heh. I'm serious, I'll do it.
 Good, go.

There's some girls right over there.

 What are you waiting for?
 They're in a group. I'm scared.

Sheldon,
what do you expect us to do?

You're biologists.
Biology is the study of living things.

That's a living thing. Get cracking.

I specialize in microorganisms
and Amy studies brains.

Yeah, neither of us minored
in bird shooing.

Oh, come, now.
Your undergraduate work...

must've included
a varmints and critters class.

Come back in, Sheldon.
He's not gonna hurt you.

He looks friendly.
I think he might be someone's pet.

What? No, Bernadette.
Don't be a hero.

 Aw, he's a sweetie.
 Yes. He's very sweet.

Now slowly and carefully
flush him down the toilet.

Sheldon, the only way to get past
this fear is to interact with it.

Just like you did with the mailman.

Every year, tens of people
around the world are killed by birds.

I'm not going to be another statistic.

Look how sweet he is.
Come over and say hi.

Come on, you can do it.

Don't be scared.


Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby.


I did it, heh.

I actually did it.

Okay, now flush him.

So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?

Um, let's see.

Hiking.

Karaoke in Koreatown.

Any Jennifer Anniston movie.

 Hey, sorry I ditched you.
 No, it's fine. Ditch away.

Oh, no.
We were gonna hang out. Let's hang out.

 It's cool. Go back to Kevin.
 No, he had to leave.

Interesting.

So now that he's gone,
you wanna hang out with me.

 This must be Penny.
 Yep.

I totally get it.

 Uh, I'm sorry. Get what?
 Don't worry about it.

There's guys over there.
Go talk to them.

 No, no. I wanna know what you told her.
 That's kind of between me and...

 Laura.
 Laura.

Oh, okay, I see.
So while he was telling you things...

did he mention he owns not one,
but two Star Trek uniforms?

 Really?
 Yeah. Wears them.

Not just for Halloween.

Hey, pal.

You didn't see me telling Kevin
that you thought cold wars...

were only fought in winter.

Okay, then I'll return the favor...

 ...and I won't tell...
 Laura.

Laura that half the dirty movies
you own are animated.

When you were telling Kevin
about your acting career...

did you mention your long-running
role as waitress...

in a local production
of The Cheesecake Factory?

Did you tell her
about your lucky asthma inhaler?

Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.

A-S...

Take me home.

Maybe I'm not done hanging out...

You're right, it's getting late.

It's remarkable.

All that time spent in fear. For what?

He's magnificent.

Ah! Oh, dear. I just realized
I haven't offered you a beverage.

Aw, it's just like my grandma
with her parrot.

And after she lost her marbles,
with her remote control.

My phone's on the desk over there.
Take a picture of us together.

Make it good enough to go on a mug,
a mouse pad and a calendar.

If you were a dove,
I'd call you Lovey Dovey.

Oh, who am I kidding? This isn't a moment
for strict adherence to the literal.

You're just my little Lovey Dovey,
aren't you?

I guess you gotta have hollow bones
to get some sugar around here.

I still think
he looks like someone's pet.

Maybe we should put up posters.

Yes, it should have a big picture of him
and the words:

"Is this your bird? Not anymore."

We're gonna have
so much fun together.

You can carry messages
to all my enemies.

And, um...

I can tie a string to your leg
and fly you like a kite.

If you're keeping him,
I've got a cage you can borrow.

One of the test monkeys slipped
on a banana peel and broke his neck.

It was both tragic and hysterical.

Nonsense. No, Lovey Dovey
doesn't sleep in a cage.

No, Lovey Dovey sleeps
in his very own nest...

which I'm going to get off
the window sill and put in my room.

Isn't that right, L.D.?

No.

Where are you going?

Come back, Lovey Dovey.
This is your home now.

I already ordered 20 pounds
of bird feed off of Amazon.

 He's gone.
 I'm sorry, Sheldon.

How could he do this to me?

Get back here you stupid bird
so I can love you!



Okay, so we went out, saw a movie...

met some nice people, said horrible
things about each other in public.

All in all, a pretty magical night.

but you basically called me stupid...

you asthmatic dumb-ass.

I know, uh, I crossed the line.
And I'm sorry.

And no, no, uh, I really mean it.
It's not like when we were going out...

I'd just apologize for everything
so we could end up in bed.

This is a 100 percent
"sex is off the table" I'm sorry.

All right. Thank you. I'm sorry too.

Just to be clear,
sex is off the table, right?

Way off.

Maybe we're not ready to hang out
as friends.

I don't know. Up until the last part...

I was enjoying take-charge Leonard
with a little backbone.

Picking the movie,
knowing what he wants, a little cocky.

 Really?
 Yeah.

Well, then, I'm putting sex
back on the table.


What do you think about that?

Hmm, maybe I like it.

If that's what you like, I can be that guy.
I'll be anything you want me to be.

Good night, Leonard.



I am such an asthmatic dumb-ass.

I had a weird night.

Mine was great.

I'm going to be a mommy.




Hi. Did Sheldon
change the Wi-Fi password again?

Uh, yeah, it's "Penny already eats
our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi."

No spaces.

Okay. What makes you think you
can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?

I believe that you're capable
of great change.

Like, when I finally got you
to stop saying "Valentime's Day."

 Wanna hear something weird?
 Sure.

In the year 2000...

Pope John Paul II was named
an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.

What are you talking about?

You asked Penny if she wanted
to hear something weird.

Well, yeah, because I have
something weird to tell her.

Oh. I thought it was a game.

 What's yours?
 There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman.

He used to torment me
in high school.

He sent me a message
through Facebook.

 He's in town and wants to have drinks.
 Okay, Penny.

If it were a game,
here are your choices.

An e-mail from an old acquaintance...

or the head of one of the largest
religious institutions in the world...

slam-dunking
to "Sweet Georgia Brown." Pick.

Just do it,
because he's not gonna let it go.

 Basketball Pope.
 And that's how it's done.

What are you gonna do?

 Are you gonna see him?
 I don't know.

Is this the fellow who peed
in your Hawaiian Punch?

No, that was a different guy.

Was he the one who wedgied you
so hard your testicle reascended...

and you spent your whole Christmas
break waiting for it to come back down?

No, that was a different different guy.

Was he the one who used your head
to open a nut?

 No.
 Oh, oh, oh.

Was he the one
who made you eat your arm hair?

No, but actually,
that was this guy's sister.

 Well, what do you think he wants?
 I don't know.

The holidays
are just around the corner.

Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge
the other testicle up there.

I told you. That was a different guy.

Mm, that's too bad. Could've spent New
Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.


It's 2 a.m. What are you doing up?

Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony
streaming live from Stockholm.

Sure. Wanna see what all the scientists
are wearing this year.

Look at these men.

They've managed to win
the top science prize in the world...

with no more understanding
of the quantum underpinnings...

of the expansion of the early universe
than God gave a goose.

You should pay attention, Leonard.
Someday it's gonna be you up there.

 Thanks.
 So, what's got you up?

Did you have a bad clam?

 I didn't have clams.
 I don't watch you 24 hours a day.

I don't know what you do.

It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing.
I can't decide if I should agree...

to see him or not. That might be
because the last time I ran into him...

he made me floss
with my own shoelaces.

Wear loafers.

Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there
clutching that Nobel Prize.

What's the matter, Saul?
Afraid someone's gonna steal it?

Like you stole Einstein's
cosmological constant?

You know what?
I am tired of living in fear of this guy.

I'm gonna go see him...

and say the things
I should have said in high school.

"Pick on someone your own size."

"No, you did not have sex
with my mother."

And, "Yes, I do know
why I'm hitting myself."

Oh. Now Perlmutter shaking
the king's hand.

Yeah. Check for your watch,
Gustaf, he might've lifted it.

I love this dress.

 How come I never see you wear it?
 Because when I wear it, it's a shirt.

So, what's Howard doing tonight?

Oh, they all went with Leonard
to confront his childhood bully.

Oh. Terrific. High-school quarterback
against four mathletes.

When Leonard gets back,
I'd love to check serotonin levels.

Do you think he'd let me
draw a syringe full of his blood?

Hmm. He's not crazy about needles.

But if you get him to go jogging,
it'll just pour out of his nose.

I don't think I can meet the girl
who was always mean to me.

Tammy Bodnick.
One time while I was in gym class...

she stole all my clothes
and left an elf costume in my locker.

 Oh, that's awful.
 Worst part was it was too big.

That's nothing. In ninth grade,
the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion.

Within six months,
the nicknames began to fly.

I think the one that hurt the most
was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.

Oh. Wow, you poor thing.

What about you?

Oh, I don't know. My school
was a nice place. We didn't have bullies.

Come on, no one ever gave anyone
mean nicknames, or picked on them...

or put gum in their hairy knuckles
so the nurse had get it out?

No, we weren't really like that.

We played pranks on each other,
but it was never mean.

This girl, Kathy Geiger, got good grades
so we blindfolded her...

tied her up
and left her in a cornfield overnight.

 God. That's awful.
 No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.

Did Kathy Geiger laugh?

Uh, probably. It's hard to say. She kind
of had an ear of corn in her mouth.

Who would've thought?

Fuzzy Fingers Fowler
is best friends with a bully.

 What...? I was not a bully.
 Kind of sounds like you were.

And maybe a felon.

Shh. That's how you
wind up in a cornfield.

Is that him over there?

No.

How about that guy?
He looks like he'd hate you.

 I can really do this by myself.
 We're here to support you.

No, you're not. You're here to see if I
get my underwear pulled over my head.

You wore underwear?
Ha, ha. You fool.

 You figured out what you're gonna say?
 You bet.

I am going to make him apologize for
all the crap he pulled on me in school.

That's quite a list.
I can't read your handwriting.

What's that word?

Scrotum.

What's that one?

Uh, stapled.

Leonard?


 Oh, hi.
 Holy crap, man, it's good to see you.

Yeah, you too.

Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon, and Raj,
and Howard.

 Hi.
 Fellows. Can I get a beer?

Wow, look at you.
Little Leonard Hofstadter.

I hear you're a big-time scientist now.

And there's the first zinger. Ouch.

 I'm doing okay, I guess.

Come on, I read online you're a physicist
at a university. You won some medal.

 The Newcomb medal.
 Yeah. Congratulations.

Congratulations?
For the Newcomb med...?

Oh, please.
That's the scientific equivalent...

of a smiley-face sticker
on your homework.

 It sounded like a big deal.
 Oh, good Lord.

Are we gonna stand here and listen
to him tear Leonard apart like this?

 Hey, I won a Newcomb medal too.
 My point.

You should've seen this guy
back in the day. Huh?

He was so little,
he could fit anywhere.

Lockers, trash cans.

Oh, man,
how did you get inside that backpack?

Oh, I can't take all the credit.
You helped a lot.

 We were practically a comedy team.
 Like the Black Death in Europe.

Jimmy, I'm kind of curious
why you wanted to see me.

Okay, here it is.
I have this great money-making idea.

I need a gear-head
to get it to the finish line.

Mm, technically, Howard's the gear-head.
Leonard's just a dime-store laser jockey.

What's the idea?

 This is just between us, right?
 Right.

Okay. What do you think about a pair of
glasses that makes any movie into 3D?

That sounds amazing.
First movie I'm watching, Annie.

How exactly
would these glasses work?

How the hell should I know?
That's why I need a nerd.

I don't think something
like that's even possible.

Aw, come on. You could figure it out.
You're, like, the smartest guy.

The smartest...? All right.

I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm,
but, uh, even I know that was a doozy.

You can't live
in fear of this man forever.

 Sheldon, I got this.
 You clearly don't.

What my spineless friend
lacks the courage to say...

is you're a terrible person
who took advantage of his tiny size...

his uncoordinated nature,
and his congenital lack of masculinity.

 Sheldon.
 Leonard, I platonically love you, man.

But face it, you're a mess.

I don't understand.

I think what he's trying to say
is that maybe...

in high school,
you picked on me a little bit.

A little bit? The man super-glued
Hershey's kisses to your nipples.

That's funny because those aren't the
kind of kisses you want on your nipples.

 What is that?
 This is a list...

of your heinous acts
against Leonard...

one of which is certainly the cause of
him wetting his bed well into his teens.

Fourteen is not...
Uh, yeah, never mind.

What's this word?

Nancy.

You called me Nancy
for three years.

You really need to work
on your penmanship.

Man, I...

I don't know what to say.

I thought
we were just having some fun.

Well, it wasn't fun for me.

You're being too kind, Leonard.
You ruined him.

Come on, guys.

 That was pretty bad-ass, dude.
 I help the weak.

It's yet another way
I'm exactly like Batman.

And for the record,
Jimmy wasn't the reason I wet the bed.

That one has my mother
written all over it.

Anyway, I'm really sorry I made fun
of your stutter in high school.

You're doing great.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.
Oh, God, just finish the sentence.

Ah. Okay, well,
I'm sorry you feel that way.

Bye.

 No one wants to hear my apologies.
 Your mistake is doing it over the phone.

I mean, if they could look into your eyes,
they'd melt.

It doesn't matter what you did
in the past. You're a good person.

Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
You weren't just called a "b-b-bitch."

Perhaps you could assuage your guilt
through altruism.

Which word's tripping you up?

Assuage or altruism?

Both.

You'll feel better
by doing something nice for someone.

 Oh, I actually knew that.
 I never doubted you.

Every other week,
I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.

Ooh. I can't do that.

If I stand over a steaming pot,
my hair just goes: "Boing!"

 Ah. What else can I do?
 There's Habitat for Humanity.

Building houses for the poor.

I don't have my own house,
I'm gonna build one for someone else?

How about donating
some of your clothes?

Oh, my God, that's perfect, because
I have so many clothes I don't wear.

They're taking up space
I go shopping to buy more.

I have no place to put it.
This would fix that.

 What about helping people?
 And helping people.

 Here's your cocoa.
 Oh.

 Half and half instead of whole milk?
 Yes.

 Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
 Yes.

Seven little marshmallows,
no more, no less?

You got one for good luck.


I'll get it.

One for good luck.

Must be the kind of math
they do at Princeton.

 Hey.
 What are you doing here?

I wanna apologize
for stapling your balls...

throwing you naked
into the girls' locker room...

stuffing that parrot
down your pants.

What's this word?

 Laxative.
 Oh.

Right. Junior prom. Ha, ha.

That was not cool, man.

I am so, so sorry.

 Really?
 Yeah.

I just hope you can forgive me.

Uh... Yeah. Sure, I guess.

 You're a beautiful guy.
 Oh, well, yeah. Thanks, Jimmy.

Okay, I gotta go.

 Are you okay to drive?
 Yeah, yeah.

I drive better drunk, you know?

It makes you pay attention.

No. Come on in.
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

 I wouldn't be imposing?
 No.

Yes.

 Sheldon, we can't let him drive.
 Then take away his keys...

and make him wander the streets
with the other drunks.

You remember Sheldon, and Raj,
and Howard.

Not really, no.

It's funny, huh? Back in school,
I was the winner, and you were the loser.

And now we're reversed.

You're the winner.

You'd think a winner
could make a decent cup of cocoa.

 Mind if I use your bathroom?
 Yeah. It's just back there.

How about that?
After all these years...

your big, bad high-school bully
finally apologizes.

Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith
in the basic goodness in people.

 You know what would be nice?
 What's that?

As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies
who've tormented us for years...

we open our home to Jimmy,
and once he's asleep, we kill him.

I said it would be nice.
I didn't say we should do it.

Oh. I feel just like Mother Teresa.

Except for the virgin part.
That ship sailed a long time ago.

I think Mother Teresa
would've washed the clothes first.

Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room
wasn't down five flights of stairs.

You know, giving really
is better than receiving.

Oh. I used to think it was such a cliché,
but it seems to be the...

Ah! Look at these cute jeans
someone just threw away.

Donated.

Yes, to a poor waitress
who loves a boot-cut.

 Penny.
 Come on. They would be so cute on me.

Ah! They'd go great with this sweater.

I don't think Mother Teresa would...
Oh, that is adorable.

 Leonard?
 Yeah?

In case it comes up again,
this right here is an imposition.

What was I supposed to do?
He needed a place to sleep.

You're soft. This world's
gonna chew you up and spit you out.


When did I have tacos?

Morning, Jimmy.

Oh, there it is. Tacos.

 Man, I tied one on.
 Yeah, you did.

So, uh, listen,
it was great to see you again.

And thanks for the apology.

What apology?

For all the crappy stuff you did to me
in high school.

Oh, jeez, you're still harping on that?
What a puss.

 That's my French toast.
 It's good.

You really know your way
around a kitchen, Nancy.

I'm not going to say I told you so,
but we could've killed him.

I might kill him right now.

The Dark Knight has your back.

He's scared, but he has your back.

Hey, Jimmy, it's time for you to go.

 Yeah, let me just finish this.
 No. You're done.

 I want you out of my apartment now.
 Well said, Boy Wonder.

Or what?

Don't answer. That's a trick question.
I speak from experience.

I'm not afraid of you anymore, Jimmy.

Now, get out.

Uh-oh.

You did it.
You stood up to your bully.

Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself.

Do you think we can outrun him?

I don't need to outrun him.
I just need to outrun you.

I don't feel good about this.

Well, then, sit in the car
and keep it running.

You were right. A whole new load.

Come on, yoga top.
Momma needs a new yoga top.

Check it out, Bernadette.
Suede boots. Your size.

God, they're cute.
Oh, why did they have to be cute?

Wait, wait, wait, guys. Just hang on.

What is it? The fuzz?

Oh, look at us. What are we doing?

I was following you
to a life of crime...

looking forward
to the day we might be cell mates.

I don't know about Bernadette.

No, this is wrong.

Let's put everything back. Come on.

Here.


It's okay, I serve soup to poor people.



Oh, damn. They cancelled my Visa.

Oh, yay, a new MasterCard.

Uh-oh.

 What?
 I was going to get my mail.

Okay.

Are you hoping to get it telepathically?

I think you mean telekinetically.

And no.

Wasn't sure of the protocol now you
and Leonard are no longer having coitus.

Ugh.

God, can we please just say
"no longer seeing each other"

Well, we could if it were true.

You live in the same building.
You see each other all the time.

The variable which has changed
is the coitus.

Okay, here's the protocol.

You and I are still friends,
and you stop saying coitus.

Good. I'm glad we're still friends.

 Really?
 Oh, yes.

It was a lot of work
to accommodate you in my life.

I'd hate for that effort
to have been in vain.

Right.

Just to be clear, do I have to stop
saying "coitus" with everyone or just you?

Everyone.

Harsh terms, but all right.

 I'll just substitute "intercourse."
 Great.

Or "fornication." Yeah...

But that has judgmental overtones,
so I'll hold that in reserve.

So how you been?

Well, my existence is a continuum...

so I've been what I am at each point
in the implied time period.

You're just coitusing with me,
aren't you?

 Buzzinga.
 Mm.

 How's Leonard doing?
 He seems all right...

although he does spend
a disturbing amount of time...

looking at photographs of you
and smelling the pillow you slept on.

Although now that I think of it,
he asked me not to tell you that.

I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it.

I see you bought Mama Italia
marinara spaghetti sauce.

 Yep.
 That's the sauce my mother uses.

She likes cooking Italian...

because, according to her,
that's what the Romans made Jesus eat.

Interesting. I'll have to have you over
for spaghetti some night.

I'm hungry now.

Oh, um, okay. Why don't you give me
an hour and come over?

Will you cut up hot dogs into little
chunks and mix them in with the sauce?

 I don't have hot dogs.
 It's all right. I do.

Oh. You're in for what my mother calls
a real Italian treat.

 Hey, where you been?
 I was talking with Penny.

What's wrong with you? You can't
hang out with your roommate's ex.

That's totally uncool.

No, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it.

Yeah. That's why he's been whining...

about trying to invent that
memory-wiper gizmo from Men In Black.

Is he making any progress?

Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck
as Daredevil.

So would Ben Affleck.

The point is, in a situation like this,
you gotta pick sides.

You're either on team Leonard
or team Penny.

 Which one picks last?
 What?

Usually, I'm on the team
that picks last.

Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair.

Sheldon, I got you
your tangerine chicken.

I hope you're hungry.

Well, of course I'm hungry.

And as I have no plans
to eat with any other team...

I will consume my tangerine chicken
with the appropriate gusto.

Mm, mm, mm.

Okay.

Just out of curiosity,
do we still have hot dogs?

I don't know. Why?

Just making dinner conversation.

Go team Leonard.

 Oh, God, this is good.
 Let me ask you a question.

Do you believe you're going to go to hell
for eating sweet-and-sour pork?

Jews don't have hell.
We have acid reflux.

Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?

Certainly. It's not like I have
to moderate my food intake...

because I'm planning on eating again
very shortly.

Mm, mm, mm.

So you wanna do something tonight?

No, I can't. I gotta pick up my mom
from her water-aerobics class.

Eighteen overweight women
flapping their arm fat...

in a swimming pool.

It's like the manatee tank
at SeaWorld.

 What about you, Raj?
 Oh, there it is.

Now you don't have a girlfriend
you wanna hang out with me again.

I never stopped hanging out with you.

I'm the friend you call
when you have no other options.

If we were the Justice League,
I'd be Aquaman.

I wish you were Aquaman.

Then I could send you to scoop my mom
out of the old-lady tank.

Excuse me, I'm thirsty...

so I'm going to go to the refrigerator
and get myself a refreshing beverage.

You know what?
I'll just spend the evening alone.

What? Suddenly, I'm not good enough
for you?

I do so love beverages.

Now I think
I'll take my after-dinner walk.

Since when do you take
after-dinner walks?

Since when do you take walks?

I read a study online that walking
after a meal not only aids in digestion...

but increases serotonin.

If there's one thing I like more than a
refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye.

 Hold on. I'll walk down with you.
 Oh, that's not necessary.

You can go first.

Or we could go together.

I can't think of a reason why not.

 Let's go.
 Hold on.

Nope. No reason.

I've missed you.

All right,
say hello to your mother for me.

Okay.

What?

You said you were going for a walk.

I didn't say outside.

So what, you're gonna walk
up and down the stairs?

No, of course not.

That would be odd
and suspicious behavior.

 Here, Rumples. Here, boy.
 Which way are you going?

 Which way are you going?
 I parked my scooter down the block.

I'm going the other way. Bye.

Bye.

Oh, actually, I'm this way.

Do I smell hot dogs?

No. I mean,
I have no idea what you smell.

Well, I definitely smell raw hot dog.

Perhaps you're getting a brain tumor.

All right, have a nice walk.

I shall. Have a nice scoot.

You might wanna stand back.
I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.

Oh, hello, doggie. Nice doggie.

I bet you think you smell hot dogs.

Look, a cat.

Penny.

Penny.

Penny.

Here.

I had to trade the others for my life.

 Hey, Leonard?
 Yeah?

I haven't had sex in a year.

Where are you going with this, Raj?

Don't flatter yourself, dude.

 I wanna go out and meet a woman.
 So go.

I need a wingman. I don't wanna
come off like a lonely loser.

And you think my presence
will help with that?

Well, I do.
Next to you, I look like a catch.

 I'm not going out tonight, Raj.
 All right.

Would you mind if I went to your room
and downloaded Asian pornography?

Very much.

Doesn't have to be Asian.

 Don't worry. You'll meet a girl.
 No, I won't.

Yes, you will.
And she'll be beautiful...

and kind and sexy and funny and
everything you ever wanted in a woman.

 You really think so?
 I do.

You'll fall hopelessly in love
and give her your heart.

She'll take it and grind it
into pathetic little pieces.

We will have sex first, right?

Mm, mm, mm.

That's Italian.

So was Leonard okay
with you coming over?

Oh. Yes.

In fact, he said, "I'm fine. I don't care."

In no manner
which would lead one to believe...

that he was covering up feelings
of anguish and betrayal.

 Well, good.
 I'm also pleased to report...

that he's all cried out over you.

He's been crying?

Oh, I believe that was something else
I wasn't supposed to mention.

Oh, God. I feel terrible.

Do you have a stomachache too?

No. Why, do you?

No.

Why did you ask if I had one too?

Just making polite
dinner conversation.

Your turn.

All right.

So, what's new in your life?

Well, my new shoes
are not made for running.

Have you been running?

No.

It's just a suspicion I have.

Mm, mm, mm.

 I'm so glad you like it.
 I do.

Leonard never cooks for me.

Well, maybe that's because
Leonard can't cook.

You can't cook and you made me this.

Whatever. Oh, let me get the cheesecake
out of the fridge.

Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.

Look at this. Do you think she's
really doing that or is it Photoshop?

I'm sure
Martha Stewart never got naked...

with a room full
of big fat Japanese guys.

You don't know that.

Prison changes people.

Hey, where you been?

I told you. Walking.

For an hour and a half?

I got lost.

How could you get lost?
Your phone has GPS.

Satellites are down. Solar flares.

 There are no solar flares now.
 Yes, there are.

Dude, I'm an astrophysicist. If there
were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.

I'm sorry, I misspoke.

What I meant to say
was my battery died.

 What the hell was that about?
 I don't know.

Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton
doing it with Oprah?

Aw, we really need to get you a girl.

Leonard.

Leonard.

 Leonard.
 Oh, just come in!

Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

What do you want, Sheldon?

Maybe this isn't a good time.

Tell me why you woke me up
or I swear to God I will kill you.

Do you really think death threats are an
appropriate way to begin conversation?

Sometimes your lack of social skills
astonishes me.

What do you want?

You may wanna sit down.

I'm in bed.

Point taken. You may wanna sit up.

Sheldon!

I've been seeing Penny
behind your back.

Okay.

When you say "seeing Penny,"
what exactly does that mean?

We had dinner last night.

She made me spaghetti
with little hot dogs cut up in it.

Well, little hot dog.

I gave up the other five hot dogs
to a real dog.

A real big dog.

A hell hound.

It's tangential to the primary story.
How about I circle back to it?

Fine. Why did you
have dinner with Penny?

She made spaghetti
with little hot dogs.

I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.

Well, then why did you
have Chinese food with us?

I didn't wanna upset you.

Howard made it very clear that my
allegiance should be to male comrades...

before women who sell their bodies
for money.

Is it possible he said,
"Bros before ho's"?

Yes, but I rephrased it
to avoid offending the ho's.

Sheldon, I don't care
if you wanna be friends with Penny.

Oh.

So the turmoil
that has been keeping me...

from achieving REM sleep
was entirely unjustified?

Yes.

Well, then as my meemaw would say...

looks like we butchered a pig,
but nobody wanted bacon.

I guess not.

And now, as promised, the tangent.

Sheldon and the Hell Hound.

Or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.

Oh, um, ahem.

 I can come back.
 Don't be silly.

We're neighbors. We're gonna run into
each other. May as well get used to it.

Yeah. I guess you're right.

 Used to it yet?
 Nope.

Me neither.

Oh. Sheldon seemed to think
I'd be upset about you hanging out.

But I want you to know it's fine.

Oh, good.
Because his mother called me.

 His mother?
 Yeah, she wants me...

to take him shopping
for sheets and towels.

I was gonna do that.

Oh, well, then you do it.

I don't wanna do it. You can do it.

Okay, then you can take him
for shoes.

I just took him for shoes.

Well, all I know is he says
they hurt his feet.

Fine. I'll take him for shoes
next Saturday.

No. A bunch of us from work
are going to Disneyland next Saturday...

and Sheldon wants to come.

You're taking him to Disneyland?

Well, he heard me making plans
on the phone. Was I gonna say no?

All right, but let me know if you're
gonna stuff him with junk food.

I don't wanna bring home a nice dinner
for him and see it go to waste.

We're going to Disneyland.
He's gonna eat junk food.

All I'm saying is give me a heads-up.

Okay, whatever.

And don't let him go on Space Mountain
after he eats.

He'll say he can handle it, but you'll
end up with churro puke on your shoes.

All right. Got it. Anything else?

Don't let Goofy near him.

He'll have nightmares,
and I'll have to deal with it.

 What's the problem with Goofy?
 Wish I knew. He's fine with Pluto.

Do you think the elastic woman
in The Incredibles...

needs to use birth control
or can she just be a diaphragm?

Well, that's it. We're officially
out of things to talk about.

We're home.

It's 10:00. Where have you been?

We stayed
for the California Adventure water show.

It was pure Disney magic.

 I was gonna see that with him.
 How was I to know that?

It's all right. I'll see it again with you.

I have food here. You were gonna call.

 I know, I know.
 I can still eat.

No. You already threw up once.
Go put on your p.j.'s and brush your teeth.

Okay, but just don't fight.

 We're not fighting.
 Just go.

Aren't you gonna thank Penny
for taking you?

Thank you, Penny.

You're welcome, sweetie.

Want a cup of coffee?

Oh, I should probably get going.

 Come on, it's just a cup of coffee.
 Yeah. Okay.

Yeah, the whole thing
seems a little twisted to me too.

What am I smelling?

Sheldon's churro on my shoes.

Such an angel when he's asleep.

Yeah, shame he has to wake up.

I think we can do it.

Smother Sheldon in his sleep?
Wouldn't that be wrong?

No, be friends. You and me.

Oh, sure.

Absolutely.

Good. I'm glad.

Here's an idea. I'm just throwing it
out there. Friends who have sex.

Good night, Leonard.

Kidding. Just a couple of friends
goofing around.

No, Goofy, no.



Will you please turn your shirt off?

What? I'm giving myself
dramatic entrance music.

People will know I'm awesome
and to be feared.

Right. There's nothing more awesome
and frightening...

than a man who's got music blasting
from between his nipples.

 Hey, Stuart. What's going on?
 Well, you might wanna mark...

your Google calendars. Stan Lee
is coming to do a signing on Thursday.

Did he finally write a sequel
to his autobiography?

I'm sure ages 79 through 87
were just action-packed.

No, just a regular comic signing.

My uncle is his dermatologist,
and Stan's doing him a favor.

Oh, I don't wanna know that.

How can I possibly discuss with
Stan Lee the scientific foundations...

for interstellar flight on a surfboard
when part of my brain...

will be scanning his face
for signs of contagious skin disease?

Stan Lee does not have
a contagious skin disease.

Well, look who thinks
he's Stuart's uncle now.

Can't believe it.
We're gonna meet Stan Lee.

I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it

I'm about to lose control
And I think I like it

I'm sad to say
I taught him those moves.

I can't decide whether I want Stan Lee
to autograph...

my Journey Into Mystery 83,
first appearance of Thor...

or my Fantastic FourNumber 5,
first appearance of Dr. Doom.

Alex, I'm gonna go with:
"What is you're a dumb-ass?"

I've decided I'm going to have Mr. Lee
sign my copy of this month's Batman.

That's crazy. Stan Lee
had nothing to do with Batman.

Which is why no one else
will ask him to sign one.

I'll be the possessor of a unique,
albeit confusing artifact...

which will set me apart from
the hoi polloi of comic-book fandom.

That's a great idea. I'm gonna get him
to sign a Batman as well.

What is it about the word "unique"
you don't understand?

Ow! Damn. Paper cut.
Nothing worse than a paper cut.

Well, obviously,
you don't remember your circumcision.

There's Neosporin and Band-Aids
in my top desk drawer.

Why don't you keep that stuff
in the bathroom?

He does. And in the kitchen,
and in the car, and in his pocket.

Yeah, but the ones in my pocket
are mine.

 Hi.
 Hey.

Guess who's gonna be
at the comic store on Thursday.

 Um, can you give me a hint?
 Stan Lee.

Um, Stanley. Stanley. Stanley Tucci?

No, ha, ha. No. Stan Lee.

Oh. Oh, Stan Lee. Cool.

You have no idea who he is, do you?

Of course I do.
You're an important part of my life...

and I pay attention to the things
you are interested in.

 Good. Good.
 Heh, heh.

So who's Stan Lee?

Um, he was on Star Trek.

 No.
 Star Wars?

No.

Um, Stan Lee. Oh, he was in those goofy
kung fu movies you love so much?

That's Bruce Lee.

Oh.

So is this Bruce Lee's
nerdy brother, Stan?

Sheldon, why do you have all these
unopened paychecks in your desk?

Because most of the things I'm planning
to buy haven't been invented yet.

There must be thousands
of dollars here.

 Why don't you put it in the bank?
 I don't trust banks.

I believe that when the robots rise up,
ATMs will lead the charge.

You've also got something
from the Pasadena Municipal Court.

Undoubtedly yet another snide response
to my repeated letters...

complaining that the flags in front of
the courthouse are in the wrong order.

It's supposed to be federal, state,
and then city of Pasadena.

I'm sorry, you sent more than one letter
about that?

It bothers me.

 Sheldon, this is a summons.
 A summons? For what?

Looks like you ran a red light...

on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m.
on November 16th.

They got you on a traffic camera.
Nice picture.

November 16th? Penny, that's
the evening you fell in your bathtub.

I had to drive you
to the emergency room.

No, it isn't.

 Yes, it is.
 No, it isn't.

I have an eidetic memory. That's
a picture of you in the passenger seat...

holding your dislocated shoulder.

Hmm. No, it isn't.

Okay, then why is a summons
for a traffic violation...

committed in your car, bearing
your license plates, coming to me?

Okay, look, they sent me the ticket.

I told them I wasn't driving,
and they were all, "Who was it?"

 So you betrayed me.
 No.

It wasn't a betrayal.

It was more of a, I can't afford
any more points on my license.

I already have to buy my insurance
from this place in the Cayman Islands.

But the only reason
I was driving your car...

was because you were in distress,
and I was rescuing you.

Yes. And look, now you have a photo
to remember that heroic day.

It's not that big a deal.

You just go down to the court on Thursday,
and you pay the fine.

I'm not going to pay a fine.
That would imply I'm guilty.

You are guilty.

 That one I liked.
 Yeah.

I am not guilty.
I only have a learner's permit.

Penny was the teacher.
When the light turned yellow...

she said, "Go, go, go,"
so I went, went, went.

Sheldon, I'm sorry. I'll be happy
to reimburse you for the fine.

You know, as soon as I get a part
in a movie or my own TV series.

You don't need to reimburse me.
I'm not paying.

On Thursday, I will have my day in court,
and justice will be done.

In fact, I'm going to begin
preparing my defense right now.

Okay, he's going to jail.

Oh, that's right.
Thursday's Stan Lee day.

Now you see what you've done?

Because of you,
we're all going to miss Stan Lee.

Whoa!

 What do you mean "all"?
 Well, you're my friends.

You'll be standing by my side,
supporting me...

feeding me legal precedents,
and, if you have the strength...

carrying me out on your shoulders
when I'm victorious.

Yeah, okay, no.

Are you saying that you will not stand
beside me as I plead my case?

That's what I'm saying.

 Howard?
 Wow. Ahem.

Uh, Stan Lee or you in court.

Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice,
it would've been a much shorter movie. No.

Raj, you'll be there, won't you?

All right, then,
my so-called friends have forsaken me.

So I guess it'll just be me
and my eyewitness.

Oh, balls.

Try to wear something appropriate.
It won't help my case if the judge...

is busy trying to read the word "Juicy"
scrawled across your buttocks.

Penny. Penny.

Penny.

 That's just wrong.
 All right, let's go.

Wait. Hold on.
Before we get to the courthouse...

I'd like to call on your skills
as an actress.

What is this?

I've taken the liberty of scripting
your appearance on the witness stand.

You're somewhat of a loose cannon.

Don't worry, it's written
in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?

 Do I have a choice?
 Of course you have a choice.

Although we live in a deterministic
universe, each individual has free will.

Now, sit down.

"I call your attention
to the events of November 16th.

Do you remember that date?"

"Darn tooting, I do.

If the court will excuse my homespun,
corn-fed, Nebraskan turn of phrase."

 Excellent. Go on.
 "The reason that date is, like...

so totally fixed in my memory is that
I had the privilege to be witness...

to one of the most heroic acts
I've ever seen in, like, ever."

"And who performed that heroic act?"

"Why, you did, sir.
You, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

And may I add,
it is a privilege to know you."

"T here's no need for compliments.
This court is only interested in the facts."

"But it is a fact
that it's a privilege to know you.

Totally."

"A teardrop rolls down my cheek"?

Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat
would work just as well.

"But it is a fact
that it's a privilege to know you.

Totally."

Maybe you should put on
your Juicy pants again.

Pay the cashier.

Sheldon Cooper.

Good morning, Your Honor.

Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se.
That is to say, representing himself.

I know what it means.
I went to law school.

And yet you wound up in traffic court.

If it would please the court,
I'd like to begin with an opening statement.

The court would advise you
to make it quick.

The court had a dicey-looking
breakfast burrito and just took an Imodium.

Very well. A quick opening statement.

Like a milking stool,
my case rests on three legs.

I will demonstrate that
I was improperly instructed in driving...

by a woman whose lack of respect
for society borders on the sociopathic.

I will argue that the emergency
met the legal doctrine...

of quod est necessarium est licitum,
that which is necessary is legal.

But first,
I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue.

I am unable to confront my accuser,
a non-human entity, to wit, a camera.

So to sum up, improper instruction...

quod est necessarium est licitum,
Sixth Amendment.

My milk stool is complete.

 Impressive.
 Thank you.

Guilty. Pay the cashier.

I object.
You're completely ignoring the law.

No, I'm following the law.
I'm ignoring you.

Really? I would point out that I am
at the top of my profession...

while you preside
over the kiddie table of yours.

Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt
and throw you in jail...

I'm gonna give you a chance
to apologize for that last remark.

I'm a scientist.
I never apologize for the truth.

That's my spot.

I can't wait to ask Stan Lee
why he insists on giving his characters...

first and last names
that start with the same letter.

Oh, come on. Why would you do that?

Bruce Banner, Reed Richards,
Sue Storm, Stephen Strange...

Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer,
Peter Parker.

Oh, and worst of all,
J. Jonah Jameson Jr.

Okay, I'm cutting.

I'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee
after you cheese him off.

 Hey.
 Sheldon's in jail.

 Sheldon's in jail?
 You called it.

 For what?
 What do you think?

For doing the same crap he always does,
except to a judge.

 He has to stay there until he apologizes.
 So tell him to apologize.

Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard.
That didn't occur to me.

If he doesn't apologize by 5:00,
he's gonna spend the night in jail.

Oh, no, that's terrible.
The line's moving. Gotta go. Bye.

Excuse me. Excuse me, jailor?

 What?
 I need to use the restroom.

Knock yourself out.

 That's the toilet?
 Well, it ain't a wishing well.

Please tell the judge
I'm ready to apologize.

Look at that.

"To my friend Leonard.
From Stan Lee. Excelsior!"

Awesome. Mine says:

"To my friend Howard.
From Stan Lee. Excelsior!"

Mine says, "To Raj. From Stan Lee."

That's because you pissed him off
about his character names.

I didn't even mention
Dum Dum Dugan...

or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock,
Pepper Potts, Victor von Doom.

Oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.

We're home.

 Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?
 You know very well how it went.

Yeah. But we all wanna
hear it from you.

 I was found guilty and fined $533.
 I'm gonna write you a check for that.

As long as you promise to put it in your
drawer and never cash it like the others.

I also now have three points on
a driver's license I do not yet possess...

and I was forced to issue
an undeserved apology...

because I refused to urinate in
a stainless-steel bowl in front of criminals.

Plus, you didn't get to meet Stan Lee.

Okay, that's enough, Howard.
The poor guy's had a tough time.

He had to spend the entire afternoon
in jail wearing that suit.

It would be cruel to mention that,
after he finished signing autographs...

Stan Lee took Stuart and us out
for gelato.

You had gelato with Stan Lee?

He said we could call him Stan.

Except for Raj.

Well, I hope you're satisfied, Penny.

You are responsible for all the evil
that has befallen me today.

 I realize...
 Not finished.

It is because of you
that I now have a criminal record.

And it is because of you that I missed out
on having gelato with Stan Lee.

 Maybe you'll have another chance...
 No.

I will never have another chance
to have gelato with Stan Lee...

because opportunities
to have gelato with Stan Lee...

come but once in a lifetime.

The moving finger writes
and, having writ, moves on.

Did he just somehow
give me the finger?

Not just the finger, the moving finger.

Hey, Stuart.

Oh, hey, Penny. Wow.

Hi.

 What's going on?
 Nothing.

I'm just getting ready to close up
and head out.

 Cool. Got any fun plans?
 Oh, yeah. Big night tonight.

Gonna share a can of tuna
with the cat.

Oh, nice.

Not even my cat. I just feed it.
Some nights, it doesn't even show up.

Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um,
you could do me a favor.

Sure, yeah. Name it.

I'm kind of responsible
for Sheldon missing Stan Lee.

I really wanna make it up to him.
I was hoping...

you could give me his number
so I can arrange for them to meet.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't have his phone number.

Damn. All right. Thank you.

Mm-hm.

Wait.

I have his address.

Really? Great.

But I can't give it to you.

 Then why did you tell me you had it?
 I don't know. Just chatting.

You're looking at a guy who could very well
get stood up by a stray cat tonight.

I'm sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.

Mm-hm.

Wait.

 Yeah?
 Maybe we can make a deal.

What kind of deal?

I will give you the address if you go
to my cousin's wedding with me.

 You're extorting a date out of me?
 I kind of have to.

The cousin who's getting married is
the cousin I usually go to weddings with.

 Can I bring Leonard?
 Sure. What the hell?

 Deal.
 We'll tell people he's your cousin.

This is Stan Lee's front door.

We were on Stan Lee's curb,
then we were on Stan Lee's walk...

 ...and now we're at Stan Lee's front door.
 Yep.

Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee's
doorbell at Stan Lee's house.

We're about to go in and
have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.

Sweetie, I don't know if we're gonna
have cookies or what's gonna happen...

so just let me talk and...

Yeah?

 Are you Stan Lee?
 Oh, damn.

Hi. I'm Penny.
This is my friend Sheldon.

We're not friends at the moment.
Depends on how this goes.

Right, right. Anyway,
Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours.

He was supposed to meet you the other
day, but he kind of ended up in jail.

I see. And you thought you'd just
come over to my house uninvited?

You said we were invited.

Oh, no, no. I said I'm inviting you
to come with me to Stan Lee's house.

You know, you fanboys are unbelievable.

Do you think you can just ring
my doorbell anytime you want?

I mean, why don't you just come on in
and watch the Lakers game with me?

Well, I'm not much of a sports fan,
but thank you.

I'm sorry.
He doesn't really understand sarcasm.

Well, I'll give him something
he'll understand.

 Joanie, call the police.
 Nice to meet you.

Fantastic Four, Daredevil...

Invincible Iron Man,
Happy Hogan, Curt Connors...

Would you just let it go?

And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom.

 Hey. Where you been?
 I'll tell you where I've been.

You boys may have had gelato
with Stan Lee...

and gotten autographed comics,
but I saw the inside of his house...

and got an autographed application
for a restraining order.

Sweet.

Plus, I get to hang out with him again,
at the hearing.

This is going to look great...

hanging next to my restraining order
from Leonard Nimoy.



So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt
for bridesmaid dresses?

Well, if you don't mind looking
like an orange traffic cone, great.

Girlfriends, I have the answer
to our dress problems.


my cousin Irene
and her entire family died...

in a horrific carbon-monoxide accident
the night before her wedding.

 That's horrible.
 Yes and no.

All those bridesmaids dresses
remain unused...

and available to us for free.

So it seems that cloud
of odorless, deadly gas...

had a silver lining after all.

Check it out, still in the bags.
The gowns, not the bridesmaids.

I don't know. Dead people's dresses?

Yeah, and cap sleeves? Ehh...

Hmm. I was hoping
you wouldn't notice.

Irene was a slave to a good bargain
when it came to clothes...

and, sadly, as it turned out,
space heaters.

Ladies, please.

These four walls
once housed an intellectual salon...

where the mind received
nourishment as well as the stomach.

But through no one's fault, Penny...

the quality of dinner conversation
in this apartment has declined.

And again, I'm looking at no one
in particular, Penny.

Fine. What would you like
to talk about, Sheldon?

Ugh. "What would you like to talk about,
Sheldon?"

Why do you hate us?

I've prepared a number of topics
that should appeal...

to both the advanced
and novice conversationalists.

Okay, that time, you looked at me.

Who didn't? Your skin is like alabaster.
Do you even have pores?

Topic one:
"Faster-than-light particles at CERN:

Paradigm-shifting discovery...

or another Swiss export
as full of holes as their cheese?"

And converse.

 Who wants to look at bridal magazines?
 Oh, me.

Through no one's fault, Sheldon,
we're leaving.

 Wait for moi.
 What? You're leaving?

Sheldon, sometimes you forget,
I'm a lady.

And with that
comes an estrogen-fueled need...

to page through glossy magazines
that make me hate my body.

 Well.
 New topic:

"Women: Delightfully mysterious
or bat-crap crazy?"

Totally.
What's wrong with cap sleeves?

If you have the right figure for it,
they're adorable.

Hey, Amy, what brings you
to our neck of the woods?

Your Neurology Department
loaned me a culture of prions...

for my research
on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

She popped by
to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.


It's hard to make degenerative brain
maladies hilarious, yet somehow you do.

That's fun to have in a lunchroom.

The real fun starts
when you pick the rat to feed it to...

and maybe you choose the beady-eyed
mother who's been biting you all week.

Please, we're eating. Can we get that
off the table and change the subject?

Can we? Stand back...

while I turn this conversation
into a "conver-sensation."

This time, it's your fault.

I have 100 alphabetized topics...

from "Artichoke: Come on, people,
it's just a giant thistle"...

to "Zzz:
The onomatopoetry of sleep."

Amy, how long would it take
for that mad cow disease to kill me?

I don't know, four or five years.

No, that's not gonna do it.

Oi. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures
of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.

 They're out shopping right now?
 Yeah.

 Just the two of them?
 I guess.

That's cool, that's cool.

Why are they asking me about this?

What guy knows
what a sweetheart neckline is?


Leonard's coming down
the home stretch.

Come on, horsey, you can do this.

Damn. Come on, thigh muscles,
you can do this.

Yes! First place.


I would have been a great jockey
if I weren't too tall.

And scared of horses.

Sheldon, you're up.

 What?
 Come on, it's your turn.

We said we'd get more fresh air.

Sorry. I'm a little distracted.
I can't seem to get in touch with Amy.

I tried e-mail, video chat,
tweeting her...

posting on her Facebook Wall,
texting her, nothing.

Did you try calling her
on the telephone?

The telephone.

You know, Leonard,
in your own simple way...

you may be the wisest of us all.

Voicemail.

Tsk. Curiouser and curiouser.

If you're worried,
we can go and see if she's all right.

Okay.
You know, I heard in the news...

a bobcat has been spotted
in her neighborhood.

I don't think Amy was eaten
by a bobcat.

Who thinks Amy was eaten
by a bobcat?

 You do?
 Leonard...

I was just mentioning
an interesting local news item.

Now, thanks to you, I'm worried
Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.

Forget about the bobcat.

You won't stop talking about it.


Everybody hurts

Sometimes

Everybody cries


Everybody hurts

Sometimes.

She sounds weepy.
I don't like weepy. Let's go.

Hey. She's your friend. Step up.

Amy, Amy, Amy. Bye.

 Where are you going?
 I'm single. I don't need this crap.

Sheldon, what are you doing here?

You didn't respond
to any of my electronic communications.

I wanted to be alone.

Would you like to talk about it?

And keep in mind that "no"
is a perfectly viable answer.

Sheldon,
my world is crumbling around me.

Point of order.

As you're in distress...

it would be customary
for me to offer you a hot beverage.

But I'm a guest in your home...

so it would be customary
for you to offer me a beverage.

How do you wanna proceed
vis-á-vis beverages?

It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

If you'd like to take your mind off
what's troubling you...

uh, word on the street is
a bobcat has been spotted.

Penny and Bernadette went shopping
for bridesmaids dresses without me.

And that made you feel sad?

 Yes.
 I knew it.

Just keep going.
I guess I'm good at this.

It's just, I thought they liked
hanging out with me...

but I guess I was fooling myself.

When they were over here...

did you fail to offer them
a beverage?

Because I can see how that could stick
in someone's craw.

Sheldon, I'm gonna ask you something,
and I'd like you to keep an open mind.

Always.

At this moment,
I find myself craving human intimacy...

and physical contact.

Oh, boy.

You know ours is a relationship
of the mind.

Proposal:
One wild night of torrid lovemaking...

that soothes my soul
and inflames my loins.

Counterproposal:

I will gently stroke your head...

and repeat, "Aw, who's a good Amy?"

How about this?

French-kissing...

Seven Minutes in Heaven,
culminating in second base.

Neck massage...

then you get me that beverage.

We cuddle. Final offer.

Very well.

Oh, boy.

I'm just saying,
second base is right there.

Mm. I'm thinking about adopting
some quirky affectation...

like a pipe or a monocle
or a handlebar mustache.

For all those girls out there
looking for the Indian Monopoly man?

This is not a safe place.
You can't share anything here.

The two of you
need to get your women in line.

 What?
 Last night I was strong-armed...

into an evening of harp music
and spooning with an emotional Amy.

This on a night
that I had originally designated...

for solving space-time geometry
in higher-spin gravity...

and building my Lego Death Star.

And why?

Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette...

went out shopping for
some wedding nonsense without Amy...

an action they took with no thought
as to how it would affect me...

the future of string theory
or my Lego fun time.

What do you want us to do about it?

You weren't listening
to my topic sentence.

Get your women in line.

Make them apologize to Amy
and set things right.

I am a man of science,
not someone's snuggle bunny.

Why do I have to talk to Penny?
She's not my girlfriend.

You invited her to lunch
four years ago.

Everything about her is on you.
You make it so.

 Moo Shu is Penny.
 Thank you.

 Where's Sheldon?
 Oh, he was up late last night...

so I gave him an early dinner
and put him to bed.

That's so sweet.

Yeah, but now he's gonna be up
at dawn and wanna play.

So listen, guys,
the reason he was up late...

is because he was taking care
of Amy.

 She's kind of upset.
 Why?

Her feelings got hurt because
you went dress shopping without her.

I told you that would happen.

This is her first time being a bridesmaid,
and she's getting a little crazy with it.

She keeps on telling us stories about
bridesmaid traditions in other cultures...

and they're all about getting naked
and washing each other.

She keeps trying to figure out
if our cycles have synced up...

so we can call ourselves
"The Three Menstra-teers."

We thought it would be easier
to look at dresses one time without her.

 I feel terrible.
 I know, me too. We'll talk to her.

Hey, wait, how did she find out?

Raj did it. Ugh.

And he says he would do it again.

Okay, I'm sorry.

You sent me the picture.
I wasn't thinking.

 Oh, Howie.
 I'm usually pretty good at not blabbing.

You tell me tons of stuff
about these guys, and I never repeat it.

 What do you tell him?
 Oh, you know, just pillow talk.

You guys have nothing to worry about.

Did you talk about us
when we were dating?

No. All your little secrets are fine.

Yes, absolutely fine.

Ha-ha-ha. I'll tell you later.

Come on, tumor.

Come on, tumor.

Mama needs
an aggressive little glioblastoma.

Yay, brain tumor.

Probably not the same reaction you had
when you got the news.


 Hi.
 Hello.

What are you doing here?

Well, uh, we just wanted to apologize...

for not bringing you with us
the other day.

That's not necessary.
It's like Sesame Street says:

"One of these things
is not like the others.

One of these things should die alone."

No, come on, Amy,
let us make it up to you.

We'll have a girls' night.
We'll do whatever you want.

We can go down to the Korean baths
and do that thing...

where we wash each other.

With loofah mitts, no hands.

It's okay. I'm glad this happened.

I can stop pretending
that some beautiful girl...

and her cute-in-the-right-light friend
wanna hang out with me.

 Amy, we're really sorry.
 Yeah, we feel awful.

Don't. I'll be okay.

You're not the first girls I thought
were friends who ended up shunning me.

It's like elementary school, junior high,
high school, undergrad, grad school...

and that semester abroad in Norway
all over again.

Oh, come on, Amy.

You don't get it.

Look at this brain.

I don't really want to.

This is us.

Bernadette, you are the analytical,
scientific left hemisphere.

Penny, you're the creative,
spontaneous right hemisphere.

And where's Amy?

She's right here.

The sad little tumor
no one wants to go dress shopping with.

Amy, you're not a tumor.
Penny, tell her she's not a tumor.



Did you know
that when Alexander Graham Bell...

invented the telephone,
he proposed answering it with "ahoy"?

Ahoy.

I like it.

Amy? Is that you?

Have you been drinking?

I'm sorry, I bet my sweet what?

Well, all right. We're on our way.

What's going on?

Well, it would seem Amy is drunk
in a liquor-store parking lot.

Really? Amy?

Leonard, be glad you can't keep a woman.
They are a handful.

Oh, look. It's Sheldon and little Leonard.
Hi, little Leonard.

 Hi, Amy.
 Hey, Cuddles.

Cuddles?

Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled.
Grow up, Leonard.

Amy, what are you doing here?

Well, I came here
to get a bottle of wine...

like Penny taught me to do
when you're sad.

Yeah, but why didn't you go back
to your apartment?

Didn't you go to high school?
Parking lots are where cool kids hang out.

Not that the rat bastards
ever invited me.

 Maybe we should get you home.
 Hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon...

what would it take
for you to go into that liquor store...

buy a bottle of hooch, take me
across the street to that motel...

and have your way with me?

Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?

I'm begging both of you,
please, let's go.

Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.

Whee. Ooh!
Finally, someone found second base.

I know how you feel.

I got a knife
slicing through my frontal lobe too.


Hi.

What do you want?

Do you want me
to give the friendship bracelet back?

I never gave you a friendship bracelet.

When we met, I made one
and pretended you gave it to me.

You can have it back if you want.

No, you made that for you.
I want you to have it.

We know you're upset,
and you have every right to be...

but we'd like a second chance
to make things right.

We are really sorry.

We were trying to think of some way to
show you how much we care about you.

Which is why
it would mean so much...

if you would agree
to be the maid of honor at my wedding.

What?

Wait, is this some kind
of practical joke?

Like in Norway when my "friends"
trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?

No. I... l want you
to be the maid of honor.

Oh, my gosh.

No one's ever asked me
to be the maid of honor.

Well, that's not true.
Once, but then they all died.

 So is that a yes?
 Yes, heh. Yes.

Oh, my gosh, I...
I have so much to do.

There's the bridal shower
and the bachelorette party.

What should we do for the bachelorette?
Oh, I know.

Go to a Native American sweat lodge,
take peyote, roll in mud...

and paint symbols
on Bernadette's naked body.

So that's happening.

Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun too. Heh.

I feel like crying.
Of course, I could be hormonal.

Oh, wait.
Maybe our menses are finally syncing up.

 Bernadette? No? Penny?
 Sorry.

 Really?
 Okay, yeah.

Yay!

Maid of honor Amy Farrah Fowler's...

amazing behind-the-scenes
wedding video...

take one.

We're just trying on dresses.
Do we really need to record this?

I'm sorry, are you the maid of honor?

I am the bride.

So no. And action.

 What do you think?
 I love it.


What are you, a nun?

Come on, bestie,
let's see some skin.

Oh, Amy, looking sexy.

You think they don't have mirrors
in there? I know how I look.

Oh.

Bernadette, you look beautiful.

 Thank you.

Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful.

Come on, bestie, you're up.

Give me a minute.

What is taking you so long?

Oh, Amy, get the hell out of here.

Sorry, sorry. Oh, God.

 Amy!



Hey, do me a favor
and take table seven.

You mean the one
with my 118-pound

rock-hard stud of a fiancé

who's prone to canker
sores and pinkeye?

Nah, I prefer to look at it as
the one with my ex-boyfriend

and his gorgeous, successful
and sophisticated girlfriend,

who makes me feel like
a toothless Okie.

Do you want me to spill
hot soup on her?

Oh, please-- you're not
that kind of person.

I know.

But if she orders
something low-fat

I'll totally give her
the full-fat version.

Uh, that's my water.

What?

My water.
You're drinking it.

D-Dear Lord!

Have you been drinking it?

Yes. It's my water.

Well, that's it then.

I'm dead.

Here we go...

I'm sorry, do I really need
to connect the dots for you?

The backwash into this glass

is every pathogen that calls
your mouth home, sweet home.

Not to mention the visitors who
arrive on the dancing tongue

of your subtropical girlfriend.

Hey! That's my sister

and my country
you're talking about.

Leonard may have
defiled one,

but I won't have you
talking smack about the other.

You guys ready to order?

Yes, I'd like a seven-day
course of penicillin,

some, uh, syrup of ipecac--
to induce vomiting-- and a mint.

I don't understand.

He drank from
Leonard's glass.

"He drank from
Leonard's glass"--

the words they'll be
carving into my tombstone.

That's actually my napkin.

Oh, this is a nightmare!

Where are you going?
To the bar,

to sterilize my mouth
with alcohol.

Gang way! Dead man walking!

 


All right. Here you go.

Two lemonades,

one iced tea

and a root beer for Priya.

 Is it diet?
 That's what you ordered.

Thank you.

Hey, have you and Howard

started planning
your wedding yet?

Yeah. We're thinking
of having it on a cliff

overlooking the ocean.

Nothing soothes
those pre-wedding jitters

like the thought
of falling and drowning.

What did your mother say

when you told her you were
getting married?

He hasn't told her yet.

He's waiting for
the right time.

I was thinking of weaving
it into her eulogy.

Howard, you've got
to tell your mother.

Hey, have you told your parents
you're dating

this short glass
of skim milk here?

Uh... that's different.

First of all,
we're not engaged;

and second,
Indian parents

are very protective
of their children.

Right, right,
whereas Jewish mothers

take a casual, la-di-da
approach to their sons.

I gargled with tequila and may
have swallowed a teeny bit.

 You all right?
 Fine.

Thank you for asking.

I love you so much.

Fire demon.

Ooh, fire demon.

Sheldon's turning up the heat...

Troll master.

Check it! Howard pulls one out

from under the bridge. Nice!

Water nymph.

Oh, yeah, she's got puddles

in all the right places.

Could you please
play the game

without commenting
on every card?

Sorry.

Walking tree.

Last one.

I'm taking a stroll
and I'm sporting wood.

Okay, the Eagle has landed.

What's going on?

Bernadette
and my mother are having

a get-to-know-you lunch
at the Old Town Deli.

Oh, that sounds lovely.

Hope so.

Of course, if history
is any indication,

my mother will swallow her whole

and spit out her bones
like an owl.

Have you met
Bernadette's parents?

You mean Adolf and Eva?

Not yet.

One goose step at a time.

Sheldon,
that's my water.

Oh, dear Lord!

That's not your water.

I know.

Where's the mouthwash?!

"Where" indeed.

Ma, I'm home!

Where are you?

I'm in the toilet!

So, how'd it go?!

Too soon to say!

I'm not done yet!

No, I mean lunch, today,
with Bernadette!

Oh!

I had a pastrami
sandwich.

She had eggplant lasagna.

Like that's what a person
orders in a Jewish deli.

Besides food, did you get along?
Did you talk?

Oh, sure! Did you know
she's going to school

to become a
microbiologist?!

No, she never mentioned it.

I bet she did and
you didn't listen!

Yeah, that's probably it.
So, what do you think?

Do you like her?
She's great, huh?

She's a lovely girl!

Cute as a button!

That's good to hear,
'cause I've got some news.

I hope it's
good news,

because I've got nothing but
disappointment in here!

Bernadette and I
are getting married.

Ma?

You too busy bearing down?

Ma?

Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma?

Stand back,
I'm gonna break the door down!

Son of a bitch!
Ma, help!

Hey.

Hello.

Haven't
seen you in a while.

How's it going?

Oh, other than waiting out
the exponential growth period

of the virulent organisms

trooping through
my microvilli

into my circulatory system--
hunky-dory.

Did I say something
amusing?

I don't know, maybe,
I have no idea what you said.

So your mirth is merely
a discharge of nervous energy

with no semantic content at all?

My mirth. Classic.

Is there a station
coming up

where I can board your
giggling train of thought?

It's not a big deal, Sheldon.

It's just,
ever since Leonard's been

dating Raj's sister,
I've had to keep my distance.

I don't get to hear
all your jibber-jabber.

Jibber-jabber?!

I don't jibber-jabber.

What are you doing
at work these days?

Oh, I'm working on
time-dependent backgrounds

in string theory,

specifically quantum
field theory

in "d-dimensional"
de Sitter space.

Okay, come on, even you have
to admit that's jibber-jabber.

Interesting, do you know

where the phrase
"jibber-jabber" comes from?

Oh, my God,
you're about to jibber-jabber

about jibber-jabber.

Howard and his mother
are at the hospital.

 Come on, we gotta go.
 Oh, my God! What happened?

I don't know, I just got a text.
Come on, hurry.

Okay.

Sheldon, let's go!

To a hospital?!

Full of sick people?!

Oh, I don't think so.

Okay, well, your friend and his
mother are there, we're going.

I can't.

Oh, don't tell me you're
afraid of germs.

Not all germs.

Just the ones that will kill me.

It's the same way I'm not
afraid of all steak knives--

just the ones that might be
plunged in my thorax.

Fine, I'll tell Howard
you didn't come

because you're more concerned

about your own well-being
than his.

I would think
he would know that.

Okay, you know what?
You are unbelievable.

You buy all these
superhero T-shirts,

but when it's time for you

to step up
and do the right thing,

you just hide
in the laundry room.

Fine, I'll go.

Just for the record,
my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital.

She went in to
visit my Uncle Roger,

caught something and bit
the dust a week later.

The two of them
now share a coffee can

on my mother's mantel.

So I knocked down
the bathroom door,

picked up my poor
unconscious mother,

carried her to the car,

and drove like a madman
to the emergency room.

You're a real
hero, Howard.

No, I did what
any son would do.

Hang on a second--
you picked up your mother?

Her own legs
are barely able to do that.

I was filled
with adrenaline.

It happens to be how women
lift cars off babies.

Yeah, I'm saying,
it'd be easier to lift a car.

What can I tell you?
After I found the courage

to put her pants back on,
I was unstoppable.

So, how is she?

They're running tests--
I don't know.

It may have been a heart attack
or heart-attack-like event.

What's the difference?

A heart-attack-like event

is an event
that's like a heart attack.

Thanks for clearing that up.

Regardless, coronary problems
are eminently treatable.

What's more likely going
to kill Howard's mother

are the
antibiotic-resistant

super-bugs festering
in every nook and cranny

of this hospital.

Okay, you're not helping.

Disagree.

Go sit over there.

I'll sit over there--
it looks cleaner.

Is there a history of
heart disease in your family?

My family is the history
of heart disease.

There's a cave painting
in France

of one of my ancestors
doing this:

So it's probably genetic.

Well, maybe.

Mom also had just gotten some
news that might have upset her.

What?

It's not important.

Come on, Howard,
I'm going to be your wife.

You can share
anything with me.

You'd think that.
But no.

You told her we were
going to get married

and she had
a heart attack?

You can't take
that personally.

How else is she supposed
to take it?

What you've got to

keep in mind is that
ever since my dad left,

I've been the whole world
to my mother.

I mean, she'd be
threatened by any woman

who can give me
what she can't.

You mean sexual
intercourse?

Well, when you say it like
that you make it sound creepy.

What happened?

Howard's mother had
a heart attack

because I have
sex with him

and she can't.

Bernie, wait!

I'll give you $1,000
if you'll drive me home.

Nice of you to
come for Howard.

Well, he's my friend.
It's what you do.

I'm sorry, did
I miss something?

It's just so weird.

Howard Wolowitz
is my friend.

You know, once he tried to
stick his tongue down my throat

and I broke his nose.

That's a little easier
to believe

than he's your friend.

Yeah, tell me about it.

You know, my brother had a group
of friends like this in India.

They dressed up in leotards and
goggles and called themselves

the New Delhi
Power Rangers.

You mean when
he was little.

Not as little as
you'd want him to be.

You know,
this stuff is horrible.

You want to see if we
can find the cafeteria

and get real coffee?
Sure.

We're going to the cafeteria
to get some coffee.

You want anything?

I'm fine.

That's nice that
they're getting along.

Your girlfriend and your
ex-girlfriend are hanging out together?

Oh, yeah, that can
only be good for you.

What are you talking about?

One of them
broke up with you.

Do you really want her
telling the other one why?

I don't care.

I don't have
anything to hide.

Good, good.

Then you have nothing
to worry about.

No, I do not.

You are a mean little man.

You'd think it'd be because
my parents didn't love me,

but actually they
loved me a great deal.

Bernie, it's not you.

She's just set
in her ways.

How can we be together
if the thought of us

getting married
might kill your mother?

It's the circle
of life, sweetie.

One day our son will marry
someone and it will kill you.

Howard, I have to go
to the bathroom

and no one
will take me home.

What's wrong with
the bathroom here?

Pneumococcus, streptococcus,
staphylococcus

and other assorted
coccuses.

Sheldon, my mother is
on her deathbed

and my fiancée is grief-stricken
over putting her there.

I'm not taking you home.

Will you at least

go with me to the restroom here,

so you can open the door
and flush the urinal?

No!

This might be a good time
to point out, Howard,

that friendship requires
a certain give and take.

Hold the door.

Mr. Wolowitz?

 Is she okay?
 It wasn't a heart attack.

She's awake, she's
resting comfortably--

we're still
running tests.

Can I see her?

Actually, she said,
and I quote,

she'd "like to see the
little Catholic girl first."

Me? Why me?

Jews have been asking
that for centuries.

There's no real good answer.

Okay, well,
wish me luck.

Don't worry,
you'll be fine.

Let's just hide Mr. Cross.

If it touches her, it burns.

You brought a Catholic girl
home to your mother?

Yeah.

Why don't I write you a
prescription for Xanax.

Finally.

Oh, what fresh hell is this?

Wait, you can't leave here,
you've been exposed.

No, I haven't.

It's all good.

You want to talk
about crazy mothers,

Leonard's mom wouldn't give him
any sort of approval growing up.

Oh, the poor thing.

It makes him desperate
to please women.

That's why the foreplay
goes on and on.

It does, doesn't it?

It's like he's
trying to win a prize.

A word of advice--
don't doze off.

You will never hear
the end of it.

Help me!

Come back!

Penny!

There are a couple of
things I did with Penny

that might be a
little silly, but...

Like what?

Every once in a while,
before we'd go to bed,

I'd put on a little show
for her.

What do you mean
"a show"?

Well, you know,
the way I took my clothes off.

Like, to music?

I'd look pretty stupid
if there was no music.

So you'd do
a striptease?

I wasn't swinging
around a pole.

Good, good.

There was one time
I put body glitter on.

Well, I don't think
you have to worry

about Penny telling
my sister that.

No, she wouldn't.

Your big problem
is me telling her.

You really are
a mean little man.

Oh, God, that's so true.

I know, right?

Hey, what took
you guys so long?

Oh, we were
just chatting.

That's nice.
What about?

We were just
comparing notes

about how you are
in the sack.

That's funny.
Yeah.

What if she
wasn't kidding?

It doesn't matter.

I'm the king of foreplay.

Hey, how'd it go?

You're a putz.

You know what that means?

Yeah. Do you?

Your mother just
taught it to me.

She thinks she got food
poisoning from that deli

and she just wanted
to make sure I was okay.

And are you?

No, because I'm
engaged to a putz.

You let me believe I was the
reason she had a heart attack.

Well, based on the
available evid--

Shut up!

She said I'm
a wonderful girl

and that you're
lucky to have me.

Where are you going?

To the toilet!

Is that okay with you?!

Is it just me, or does she
sound sexy when she's angry?

Mountain Elf.

He takes the elf
from off the shelf.

Hell Hounds.

Hell Hounds-- who let
the Satanic dogs out?

Who? Who-who?

Colossal Serpent.

I got a colossal
serpent right here.

Must you?

Sorry, I'm just trying
to cheer my buddy up.

Rotting Zombie.

Sheldon's new
Facebook photo.

Zandor, Wizard of the North.

Ha! I win.

If you skip the part about being

under a two-week quarantine
because you were exposed

to a deadly disease--
absolutely.



 Hold.
 What?

Explain your sneeze.

 I'm sorry?
 Do you have allergies?

 No.
 Too much pepper on your salad?

 I don't put pepper on salads.
 I've heard enough. Sit over there.

Come on, I don't wanna sit by myself.

That's what Typhoid Mary said.
Clearly, her friends buckled.

Guys, help me.

 Sheldon, come on.
 Yeah, it's just one sneeze.

 You're on your own.
 See you, buddy.

Oh, Leonard, I have something for you.

Per our roommate agreement,
this is your 24-hour notice...

that I will be having
a non-related female...

spending two nights
in our apartment.

When you say non-related female,
you still mean human, right?

Well, of course.

Pets are banned by the agreement,
with the exception of service animals...

such as Seeing Eye dogs
and, one day...

cybernetically enhanced
helper monkeys.

Are you planning
on kidnapping a woman?

 Sarcasm?
 Yes.

But mixed with genuine concern.

For your information...

I'll be playing host
to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.

 Cosmological physicist from Princeton?
 Yes.

And until you acquire
a surgical mask...

please address your comments to me
through a napkin.

We've been corresponding for years
about our mutual interest...

in gravitational wave signatures
of inflatons in the early universe.

Now she's under consideration
for a position at our university.

Why didn't you tell me
you knew Elizabeth Plimpton?

I am a huge fan of hers.

I didn't realize I had to share
my connection...

with things you're a fan of,
but, very well.

You enjoy Canadian bacon.
I've been to Toronto.

 Okay, fine. Where is she gonna sleep?
 My room, of course.

Holy crap.

Holy crap.

 Yeah, I have a two-part question.
 Go ahead.

A, are you kidding me?

And B, seriously,
are you freaking kidding me?

A, I rarely kid.

And B, when I do kid, you will know it
by my use of the word "buzzinga."

So you're saying the two of you are
going to be sleeping in the same bed?

Yes.

Buzzinga.

Leonard?

Thank you.

Why is a renowned scientist staying
in our apartment instead of a hotel?

She doesn't care for hotels.
And who can blame her?

Windows that don't open,
multi-user linens...

keys shaped like credit cards.

As if one walks around
with unassigned slots in one's wallet.

All right, I believe I have time
for one more question.

Yes, Raj?

When can I sit with you again?

When I've seen two negative
throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart.

You know the drill.

All right, if you'll excuse me...

I am off to start
a prophylactic course of antibiotics.

I can't believe he's friends
with Elizabeth Plimpton.

I can't believe
they let him into Canada.

Whoa. You heard the man.
Where's your throat cultures?

 Kidding. Sit down.
 Ha.

 Hey, Sheldon.
 Oh, Penny, excellent.

I have a question
about these maxi pads.

Are the wings truly functional
or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?

What? What are you
doing with...? What?

The stock boy at Walgreens was
frustratingly uninformed on the subject.

Sheldon, what are you doing
with maxi pads?

I have a lady friend who will
be staying with me for a few days.

Oh.

What?

I want her to feel at home.

I also bought scented soaps,
pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews...

and what is apparently a yogurt
specifically designed...

to regulate the female bowel.

Wait. Wait, hold on. Back up.

You're having a woman stay with you?

Yes. Why does that seem
to flabbergast everybody?

No, no, no, I'm not flabbergasted.

I'm puzzled.

Yeah, let's go with puzzled.

A word of warning:

My guest is a noted physicist...

and the leading expert
on quantum cosmology...

so please try to avoid wasting her time
with female gibber-gabber.

Female gibber-gabber?

Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks...

gossip about your friends,
Brad and Angelina.

No, they're not my friends.

Not surprised, considering how
you talk about them behind their backs.

She's here. She's here.
How do I look? Do I look smart?

Oh, good grief. This isn't about you.

Coming.

Now, listen, one of the great minds
of the 21st century...

is about to play host to one of the
other great minds of the 21st century.

So pay attention.

Years from now, my biographer
might ask you about this event.

Well, I have so many things
to tell your biographer.

Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness.

I completely forgot your address.

But then, I remembered
that I'd written it on my hand.

Lucky I didn't confuse it with
what I'd written on my other hand...

which are the coordinates
for a neutron star.

Because if I tried to go there,
I'd be crushed by hyper gravity.

 Anyway, hello.
 Hello.

 Nice to finally meet you in person.
 I would imagine it is.

This is my friend and roommate,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

Hi-lo.

Oops. I started to say hi, and then
I switched to hello in the middle.

It came out "hi-lo."

Duh.

It's nice to meet you.

I've read both your books
and your papers.

I'm Leonard.
I live here. You're brilliant.

I apologize.
He's only an experimental physicist.

No need to apologize. Some of my
best friends are experimental physicists.

Well, not my best friends.
But I know them.

My best friend
is a molecular chemist named Wendy.

I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

 Hi-lo.
 Heh, heh.

Hungry? Can I offer you anything?

If anyone should offer her anything,
it should be me.

Elizabeth, can I get you something?

Perhaps a feminine-hygiene product
or a bowel-regulating yogurt?

Interesting choices.

Based on my current needs,
I guess I'd pick the yogurt.

Excellent.

If the yogurt works, I bought
some delightful scented candles.

Look, it's you.

Thank you so much
for opening up your home to me.

Well, who wants to stay in a hotel?

Windows that don't open,
those crazy card-shaped keys.

I'm so glad you understand.

No, he doesn't understand.

 I understand.
 I understand too.

You're just misappropriating
my understanding.

I think any university would want you.

Except any university
that already had you...

because they would've
already wanted you...

before they, you know, got you.

From the mind that brought you hi-lo.

Let me show you to your room.

All right, I guess I am tired.

 Good night, Leonard.
 Sleep night.

I mean, obviously, good night.

I started to say sleep tight.
Then I changed my mind in the middle.

I swear to God, I'm smart.

Get it together, man.

All right, let me show you
some of the features of the room.

First, windows. Conventional.

Open, closed. Open, closed.

Halfway open, or halfway closed...

depending on
your philosophical bent.

Over here is my comic-book collection.
Feel free to browse.

There's a box of disposable
reading gloves on the nightstand.

Good to know.

In here,
you'll find emergency provisions.

An eight-day supply
of food and water, a crossbow...

season two of
Star Trek: The Original Series...

on a high-density flash drive.

What if there's a disaster
that destroys all the USB ports?

Then there's really
no reason to live, is there?

Can I ask you a question
about your roommate?

He's an odd duck, isn't he?

What's his relationship status?

Well, there was
a misbegotten adventure...

with a waitress
who lives across the hall.

It ended as inexplicably as it began.

They had very little in common
except for carnal activity.

That's why I acquired
these noise-canceling headphones.

If you decide to use them,
please clean the earpieces afterwards...

with the Wet Wipes
you'll find in the bathroom.

They're in the drawer
labeled "Wet Wipes."

 Okay.
 Good.

I'll leave you
to your nighttime ablutions.

I've e-mailed you
the morning bathroom schedule.

You'll also find a laminated copy
in your welcome packet.

On the back of
the emergency-escape-route diagram.

How thoughtful.

 Sleep well, my friend.
 You too.

Let me just get one thing.

It's my backup emergency supply kit.

The living-room escape route
doesn't pass through here.

Now, good night.

And if there's an apocalypse,
good luck.

Yes?

 I saw your light on.
 Is everything all right?

Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.

Me neither.

Look what I'm reading.

It's you.

 I thought you already read it.
 I did.

But it's been a while, and I wanted
to sound smart over breakfast.

Aw, you're smart.

Oh, good. I wasn't sure
it was coming across.

What chapter are you on?

Uh, six.

Ah. The extragalactic distance ladder.

 Want to know a little secret?
 Sure.

I wrote the section on the
Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.

Really?

Sure doesn't read that way.

Here, let me show you.

When we consider the brightness
of pulsating variable stars...

we start to see
a possible explanation...

for some of the discrepancies
found in Hubble's constant.

Wow.

You really make science come alive.

Vocal test.

Morning vocal test.

Second vocal test.
Second morning vocal test.

 Morning, Sheldon.
 Morning.

 Morning, Sheldon.
 Morning.

 I trust you had a pleasant night?
 More than pleasant.

Excuse me.
I'm going to relieve myself.

 How do you take your coffee?
 Black.

Okeydoke.

Pee for Houston. Pee for Austin.

Pee for the state my heart got lost in.

And shake twice for Texas.

Something his mother taught him.

All right.
Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours.

The seat is down and has been
sanitized for your protection.

That's very thoughtful,
but I think I'll finish my coffee first.

Ah, so the yogurt didn't work.

I'll fire off a critical e-mail
to the manufacturer.

Oh, good, you're up.
My car won't start.

I need a ride to work.

Did you ignore
your check-engine light?

No, Mr. Smarty-pants.

I ignored the fill-gas-tank light.

Leonard, Penny wants to exploit
any feelings you have for her...

in order to get a ride to work.

Oh, uh, sure, let me just put this
in a travel mug.

 Hello?
 Hi.

Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton,
a leading expert on quantum cosmology.

Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress
who doesn't understand...

the role gasoline plays
in the internal combustion engine.

 Nice to meet you.
 Nice to meet you too.

 Are you enjoying your stay?
 Yes, very much.

Good.

Wonderful. Meaningless
pleasantries accomplished.

Elizabeth, Leonard's bathroom time
is coming up...

and, believe me,
you do not want to follow him.

Excuse me.

Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed
so I can take everyone to work.

You and Sheldon and Sheldon's friend,
Dr. Plimpton, who you just met.

It'll be fun.

Like a clown car. Heh, heh.

 Hang on.
 Hm, yeah? What? Huh?

We just broke up.

You and me? Yeah, we did.

Not too long ago.
How are you doing with it?

Not as good as you, apparently.

I don't follow.

You know, it's none of my business.

You wanna sleep with Sheldon's buddy
right after we broke up, go for it.

 Well, now...
 Excuse me.

I'm uncomfortable
with you recommending...

Leonard pursue intercourse
with Dr. Plimpton.

Who, I assure you,
has better things to do.

I'm not recommending it.

I'm saying it already happened.

Oh, that's preposterous.

Tell her, Leonard.

Well...

No.

Oh, come on. It wasn't my fault.

The implication being that you somehow
tripped and fell into her lady parts?

I'm just gonna take the bus to work.

 Penny, I can still drive you.
 No, no, it's okay.

You might slip on a banana peel
and get me pregnant.

I must say,
I'm shocked by this betrayal.

I didn't betray Penny.

Not Penny, me.

How am I betraying you?

Elizabeth's my friend,
and you're playing with her.

Yeah, I guess I did.

What the hell are you doing?

Relax, it's Nyquil.

 You still have a cold?
 Maybe, but I don't care.

That's the great thing about Nyquil,
it's like 10 percent booze.

I call it the nighttime
sniffling, sneezing, coughing...

so-you-can-talk-to-girls medicine.

Are you having trouble sleeping?

Because, boy, I was up all night.

Did you get a cold too?

No, I was awake all night.

If you want, I can give you
some of my mom's sleeping pills.

 She won't notice they're missing?
 She doesn't know she takes them.

No, that's okay. It was something else
keeping me up last night.

And again this morning.

And I didn't mind.

I was up last night.
I was up this morning. I didn't mind.

Those are your clues.

Ooh, ooh, did the pigeon
on your window sill have more babies?

 No.
 Were you making another Lego movie?

 No.
 Because let me tell you:

It's not enough to make the Legos move.
They also have to capture your heart.

Okay, I'll give you one more clue.

It involved another person.

Did you get a Japanese love pillow?

How is a Japanese love pillow
another person?

It is if you love her
and give her a name.

Dr. Plimpton,
I'd like you to meet my colleagues.

Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

 And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
 Hi.

 I'm a big fan of your work.
 Thank you.

And, of course, you've already
introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.

 Hey, you.
 Hey, you.

Boy, I'm kind of tuckered out.

How are you feeling, Elizabeth?

You know what? I am a little tired.

Would you be a dear
and get me a cup of coffee?

Sure. Black, right?

Actually, now I think I want it
hot, brown and sweet.

Coming right up.

What?

What do you mean, "what?"
It's "Halo" night.

I can't. I'm too sick.

Go away.

That's why we moved
"Halo" night here.

I brought my mom's chicken soup.

I'm not hungry.

Don't send him away. Let him in.

 Who is that?
 I bought a parrot.

Yeah, right.

 Dr. Plimpton?
 Hi.

 Howard, right?
 Uh, yeah.

Can I ask you a question, Howard?

Do you like role-playing games?

Yeah, sure. Heh.

In fact, I'm a dungeon master.

Not tonight.

Tonight, you are a deliveryman.

You've brought soup but, uh-oh, Raj and I
don't have enough money to pay you.

So we'll have to come
to some other kind of arrangement.

Beg pardon?

You figure out the details.
I'm gonna change into something...

I don't mind getting ripped off
my milky flesh.

What the frak?

Go away.

She wants New Delhi, not kosher deli.

Besides, you have a girlfriend.

We broke up weeks ago.

 Why didn't you say anything?
 I was waiting for the right time.

This is the right time.

Hey, who's ready for "Halo"?

Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost.

The numbers
are shaky enough as it is.

I don't understand.

Oh, good. Leonard's here.

Good?

Elizabeth? What's going on?

What's going on is you and Howard
are my moving men.

And Raj is my new landlord.

And I don't have enough money
to pay any of you.

Is she suggesting
what I think she's suggesting?

Yup. Welcome to
the Renthouse Forum.

Okay, show of hands.
Who's up for this?

We'll all be naked
in front of each other.

I'm out.

Everybody ready?

Follow my lead. Almost.

We're going to go out into the hallway
and make a dramatic entrance.

Oh, good. It's so much better
when everyone commits.

Run, run, run. Don't look back.

I thought we had something special.

So you say you can't pay your rent?

 Oh, Leonard?
 Hey.

I found these in the dryer.

I'm assuming they belong to Sheldon.

Thanks. It's really hard
to find these in his size.

So listen.

I've been meaning to talk to you
about the other morning.

You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?

Yeah, I wanted to explain.

No. You don't owe me an explanation.

 I don't?
 No, you don't.

So you're not judging me?

Oh, I'm judging you
nine ways to Sunday...

but you don't owe me
an explanation.

Nevertheless, I'd like to get one
on the record...

so you can understand
why I did what I did.

I'm listening.

She let me.



It's from Game of Thrones.

 What do you think?
 I don't know.

If we're going to start
a fantasy sword collection...

And I've long thought we should.

Is this really the sword to start with?

What did you have in mind?

Well, off the top of my head,
I'd have to go with Excalibur.

It gives you the right to rule England.

It would be a replica of a movie prop.

Fair enough.

It would give you the right
to rule a replica of England.

Well, they don't have an Excalibur here,
so, what do you want to do?

Ugh, tough decision.

There's no weaponry
from Lord of the Rings...

forged in a Chinese sweatshop?

Mm-hm, just Bilbo Baggins'
sword over there.

Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger,
wouldn't we look silly?

 Okay, let's go for it.

Oh, I see you guys have found
my little treasure.

Yeah, pfft, it's okay, I guess.

Okay? It's magnificent.

Buh-buh-buh-buh.

What do you want for it?

Oh, it's hard to
put a price on something...

that's a copy of something
that was on pay cable.

But for my friends, let's say 250.

 Ooh, that's pretty steep.
 It's a limited edition.

They only made 8000 of these
bad boys.

Only 8000.
We're wasting precious time. Buy it.

Hang on. Can you do any better?

I'm already giving
you the friends and family discount.

Oh, did you hear that?
The friends and family discount.

We are honored and we will take it.

Slow down. Two hundred.

What are you doing?
250 is already a discounted price.

 Will you shut up?
 Tell you what, I'll go 235.

Nope. Maybe another time.

 Okay, 225, my final offer.
 Take it, take it.

 Two hundred.
 Man, you're killing me.

Killing you? I can't breathe.

Two ten and I'm losing money.

Oh, no, we can't let him lose money,
Leonard. I'm so sorry.

Two ten and you throw in
the Iron Man helmet.

Are you crazy? That helmet's
signed by Robert Downey, Jr.

So?

If you're gonna question
the importance of a signature...

on a plastic helmet from a movie
based on a comic book...

then all of our lives
have no meaning.

 Okay, fine. Just the sword, 210.
 Thank you. I can eat meat this week.

See that? I just saved us 40 bucks.

I've long said that what you lack
in academic knowledge...

you make up for in street smarts.

 You want me to wrap it?
 No, it's okay.

I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.

 Hey, Stuart.
 Ah, hey, Wil.

Hello, Wil Wheaton.

 Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
 It's part of my sword collection.

 Do you have a sword collection?
 No.

Heh, I'm not surprised.

Here's the Batman six twelve...

with the Jim Lee alternate cover
that you wanted.

 Oh, awesome. What do I owe you?
 Forty bucks.

 Good deal.
 Sucker.

He didn't even ask
for the friends and family discount.

I'm having a party on Friday
and I was hoping you would stop by.

 Will there be girls there?
 Of course.

Because there wasn't last time.

There will be girls.

You guys are invited
if you want to come by.

 Thank you.
 All right, great. Later.

I see what you're doing.

You accept an invitation to a party
at the home of my sworn enemy.

He tells everyone
we're going to be there.

And when we don't show,
he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.

I was actually thinking about going.

And then declaring the party
a fiasco and storming out...

leaving him humiliated
in front of his guests. Love it.

No, I was gonna grab Raj
and Howard and have a good time.

Ah, great, more guys.

It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton
sausage-fest.

 Sheldon, can you grab me a water?
 Possibly.

 Can you or can't you?
 It's not that simple, Leonard.

It never is, is it?

At this moment,
our relationship exists...

in two mutually contradictory states.

Until you either do not go
or go to Wil Wheaton's party...

you are simultaneously
my friend and not my friend.

I'm characterizing this phenomenon
as Schrödinger's friendship.

 Got it. Can I have my water?
 Yeah, of course.

Now get it yourself, you traitor.

 Wait, what is going on?
 In case you have forgotten...

 ...Schrödinger's cat is a thought...
 No, I didn't forget.

Um, there's this cat in a box
and until you open it...

it's either dead or alive or both.

Although our cat got stuck
in my brother's camp trunk...

and we did not need to open it to know
there was all kinds of dead cat in there.

Homespun stories, knowledge
of physics and a bosom that defies it.

You're the whole package,
aren't you?

Sorry I'm late. Ugh, I got great news.

NASA picked my team's design
for the deep field space telescope...

that's going on the
International Space Station this spring.


 Howie, that's wonderful! Congratulations!

It gets better. Someone has
to go up with the telescope...

as a payload specialist,
and guess who that someone is, heh.

Muhammad Li.

Who's Muhammad Li?

Muhammad is the most
common first name in the world...

Li, the most common surname.

As I didn't know the answer, I thought
that gave me a mathematical edge.

It's me, Sheldon. It's me.
I'm going up in space!

Technically, I'm an astronaut.


 Heh.
 Hang on a second.

NASA doesn't have a shuttle anymore.

 How are you gonna get up there?
 Oh, uh, it's cool.

You fly to Moscow,
they take you to Kazakhstan.

Then you get in a Russian Soyuz rocket
which shoots you into a low earth orbit.

Or it just sits on the launch pad because
the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel...

on the black market, heh.

Are those Russian rockets safe?

Safe as it can be...

when it was built by the folks
who brought you Chernobyl. Ha, ha.

I'd like to propose a toast.

The dream to go up into space
is one we all share...

and Howard's making that a reality.
We're all very proud of you.

Cheers.


 That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
 Thank you.

Simultaneously, a festival
of cloying clichés. You sicken me.

You're really quiet. Is everything okay?

Fine.

Just a little tired.

I hope not too tired because I'm feeling
particularly masculine right now.

All systems go,
if you catch my drift. Heh.

I always catch your drift.

Well, something's obviously
bugging you.

What is it?

I can't believe you signed up for
the space program without talking to me.


I get it. We...
You're worried about me.

That is so sweet. You know,
there's a saying we have at NASA.

What makes the right stuff so right
is that it always comes home.

Just stop talking, Howard.

This isn't the reaction I expected...

when I told you
I was gonna be an astronaut.

What did you think was gonna happen?

Honestly? Sex, heh.

 Howard.
 Do you realize what a big deal this is?

What an honor it is
to be chosen to go into space?

Yeah, I get it. I just wish
you included me in the decision.

We're supposed to be partners.
We're supposed to be a team.


I'm sorry. You're right.

Uh, okay, let's try this again.

Bernadette,
an opportunity has come up...

that impacts both of us
and I'd like to discuss it.

 Okay.
 Heh, I've been offered a chance...

to go up to the International
Space Station for three weeks.

What are your thoughts on that?

Well, first of all...

thank you for including me
in the decision making process.

Hey, we're a team. Heh.

 So, what do you think?
 No.

 No?
 No.

Wh...?

Whoa, why not?

Howard, ugh,
my father was a police officer.

We never knew
from one night to the next...

if he was gonna come home alive.
It was horrible.

And I don't want to live
that way with you.


Well, hey...

my father abandoned me
and my mother when I was 11.

We never saw him again.

Oh, boo hoo, you're not going to space.

 Pretty cool about Howard, huh?
 Don't talk to me...

as if nothing's happened between us.
And yes, it sure is, buddy.

Will you stop
with the Schrödinger stuff?

Would you prefer an application
of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?

In which I could either
know where you are...

or whether I like you, but not both?

You never stop talking, do you?

What difference does it make
if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?

No, Wil Wheaton
is Sheldon's mortal enemy.

 Mortal enemy?
 Mm-hm.

Sheldon, I know you're a bit
of a left-handed monkey wrench but...

 You really have a mortal enemy?
 In fact, I have 61 of them.

 Would you like to see the list?
 Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.

You just got off the list.
Would you like back on it?

This'll just take a moment.
It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.

 A floppy disk?
 Well, I started the list when I was 9.

How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?


As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher...

Wil Wheaton's character
on Star Trek.

So I drove for hours by bus
to a Star Trek convention...

at which Wil Wheaton
was scheduled to appear...

so that I could get
my Wesley Crusher action figure signed.

But he never showed...

because apparently,
it was "cooler" for him...

to be the lower-left corner
on Hollywood Squares.

Oh, damn! The floppy failed.

Well, whoever was in charge
of quality control...

at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989,
congratulations, you just made the list.

 Howard?
 Change your mind about sex?

I'm still mad but I'll do it.

No, I've just been thinking.


It doesn't matter
if I'm afraid for your safety.

I don't want to be the person who stands
between you and your dreams.

 Really?
 Really.

If going into space means that much
I will never say another word about it.

Thank you, heh.

 I love you.
 I love you too, heh.

So sex now?

 Okay.
 Heh.

I just forgot to brush my teeth.
I'll be right back.


my son goes into outer space!

I'm ready.

Let me see if I got this right.

You actually asked Bernadette
to leave your house?

What choice did I have?
She went behind my back...

and turned
my own mother against me.

Wow, you're not
only our first astronaut.

You're also the first one of us
to kick a girl out of bed.

You're like a rock star.

 Little bit, heh.
 I hate to say it...

 ...but she did kind of betray you.
 Interesting.

You see betrayal in others
but not yourself.

Going to Wheaton's party
is not betraying you.

Of course, you would have to believe that.
Evil always thinks it's doing right.

Huh.

Excuse me, Stormtrooper.
These are the droids you're looking for.

I'm going to a party.

I'm not turning R2-D2
and C-3PO over to the Empire!

Not yet.

What's gonna happen? Are you
and Bernadette gonna break up?

If we're going to get back together,
she's gonna have to apologize...

and accept that I'm a grown man
who can make his own decisions.

Then convince your mother
to let you go into space.

Obviously.

I had no choice.
I had to tell his mother.

He can't go to space.

He's like a baby bird.

Do you know he once got
an asthma attack...

from reading an old library book?

 You're kidding.
 No, I was there that day.

Sheldon threw his back out
handing him that book.

I don't know what I'm going to do.

I don't want to break up over this.

Why don't you tell him
you made a mistake?

Do you guys think it was a mistake?

Am I the bad guy in this?

It's not for us to judge. We're here
to provide comfort and support...

while you come to grips with
what a despicable thing you've done.

Oh, God, you're right.

I took our love and
threw it under his bus-sized mother.

 I need to apologize.
 That's good, I'm glad you came to that.

But before you do, let me just
ask you a big picture question.

What?

Are you a hundred percent positive
you love...

and want to marry
Howard Wolowitz?

 I do, with all my heart.
 Tsk, got it. Just had to check.

He's great.

All right, Sheldon.
We're going to Wil's.

 This is your last chance.
 No, Leonard, this is your last chance.

One day, a historian
is going to come to you and say:

"Is it true you were friends
with Dr. Sheldon Cooper?"

And you're going to have to choke back
a hot sob of regret and humiliation...

as you mumble,
"I was, but I chose to go to a party...

thrown by the one kid from
Stand By Me that no one remembers."

 You want to drive?
 Sure.


 Hey, Sheldon?
 Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.

No, I just got a text from Stuart.
Brent Spiner is at the party.

 Brent Spiner?
 Yes.

I don't care.

Really? Brent Spiner,
Mr. Data himself. You love him.

I did, but I think
I've kind of outgrown Star Trek.

You know, stock characters,
ludicrous plots, beam me up.

What a load of hooey.

I'm going.
Live long and prosper, Sheldon.

Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.

Howard, Bernadette's here!

Tell her I'm not home!

play is that? She can hear you shouting!

 Can we talk?
 You can. I have nothing to say.

All right.

I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry
I said something to your mother.

I was gonna tell her eventually
but you went behind my back.

I know. I'm sorry.

 I got scared.
 If you're gonna love me...

you're gonna have
to love the whole package.

The tenderhearted poet
and the crazy daredevil.

 I know.
 Don't say it if you're not gonna mean it.

I'm not just gonna stop
with the space station.

Yeah, I want to go to the moon,
I want to go to Mars.

I want to take a one-man sub
to the lowest depths of the ocean.

Really? You got seasick
on Pirates of the Caribbean.

Well, those big kids were rocking it, heh.

I just did what I did
because I love you so much...

and the thought of losing you
is more than I can handle.

 Really?
 You're my soul mate.


 This is where you kiss me.
 Right, right, heh.

Your tokus is not leaving this planet!

Hey, you know that beautiful actress...

who plays the Borg Queen
in First Contact?

 Yeah.
 Well, I just met her gynecologist.

 What are you doing here?
 Fighting for our friendship.

As peculiar and annoying as you can be,
you're still my little buddy.

I'm not going to let that
end here tonight.

Now put down that drink,
let's meet Brent Spiner and go home.

Hey, Sheldon,
I'm so glad you made it.

I found something
I think you might like.

What I'd like is for him
to have a more depressing home.

This is quite lovely.

This is for you.

An original mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.

I remembered your story about
the time you went to a convention...

to get one signed and I didn't show.
Look at what I wrote.

"To Sheldon, sorry this took so long.
Your friend, Wil Wheaton."

It's my last one.
I want you to have it.

Look, everyone.
Wil Wheaton is my friend!

Oh, wow. I haven't seen
one of these in years.

Remember how we used to make these
things look like they were masturbating?

Brent Spiner, what have you done?

That was a mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.

Signed by my close personal friend,
Wil Wheaton.

Sorry, Slim. I've got some Mr. Data dolls
in the trunk of my car.

You want me to sign one for you?

You've already signed something,
Brent Spiner.

Your name on my list.

From this moment on,
you are my mortal enemy.

Don't worry. It doesn't take up
a whole lot of your time.

Come on, buddy. Let's not waste
another second on this loser.

Love your house.

 Can we get autographed dolls?
 Sure.

Twenty bucks.

Ten.

 Eighteen.
 Twelve.

 Sixteen.
 Two for 30.

And you come to my birthday party.

Done.



Mmm...

Gentlemen, I put it to you.
The worst tapioca pudding is better than
the best pudding of any other flavor.

First off, that is axiomatically wrong,
because the best pudding is chocolate.

Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it
a jiggling bowl of potential death.

It is extracted from the plant-

Hey, I'm thinking of growing a mustache.

No kidding! Foo Man Choo! A handlebar pencil.

Sheldon: It is extracted from the plant-
Howard: I'm not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!

Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph's.
He was buying tequila.

You think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey.

Alright this is cruel,
we better let him finish before his head explodes.

Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca...

Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot esculenta.

Due to a high concentration of cyanide,
it is poisonous in its raw form
and lethal if prepared improperly.

Feel better now?

It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean,
from which we get chocolate, the best pudding.

And you promised you wouldn't do that anymore!

Hey Hofstadter!

Hey Kripke.

Read about your latest proton decay experiment,

20 thousand data runs and
no statistically significant results.

Very impressive!

What a jerk.

Don't feel bad Leonard,
negative results are still results.

Even 20 thousand of 'em.

Alright.

Please don't cheer me up anymore.

C'mon, don't let him get to you.
It's Kripke.

Yeah, he's a... ginormous knob.

That's why he eats by himself,
instead of sitting here at the cool table.

Fo' shizzle.

Hey it's true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted.

But he also controls the new open science grid computer
that I need to use to run some simulations of
structure formation in the early universe.

Good luck getting time on it.
The only people he lets use it are his friends.

Well then, the solution is simple.

I shall befriend him.

Kripke!

Yeah?

What'd you say of the idea of,
you and I becoming friends?

I would say, I have no interest in becoming your friend.

Really? That seems rather short-sided,
coming from someone who is generally considered
altogther unlikable.

Why don't you take some time to reconsider?

Yeah, I'll do that.

Well I think we're off to a terrific start.



There you go.

Now any e-mail from Wolowitz
will go right into your spam folder.

Thanks!

I mean the e-mail doesn't bother me as much as
the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.

Yeah, I got the same one.

And that's not a bathing suit, it's a tan line.

Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper.
I'm leaving a message for Barry Kripke.

Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria.

I saw that you purchased the chef's salad.

Apparently, you did not know that the chef's salad
is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat.

Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it.

I'm following up on our pending friendship,
and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status.

Sheldon Cooper.

What's up with Ichabod?

Oh he's trying to make a new friend.

Oh really? Well, good for him.

Well, unless he's makes one out of wood like Gepetto,
I don't think it's gonna happen.

Well, how did you guys become friends?

There was a fire on the bulletin board at the university.

Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.

And you moved in anyway?

I assumed he was joking.

You'd be surprised how many
particle physicists have a whimsical side.

Oh what about Howard and Raj you mean?
How did you become friends with them?

I don't know...

How do carbon atoms form a benzene ring?

Proximity and valence electrons.

Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way.

But it all worked out, right?

I suppose.

I do miss whistling though.

Oh come on. Really?

(Whistles)

1st warning.

(Knocks) Penny.

(Knocks) Penny.

(Knocks) Penny.

This is for you.

Hello Sheldon.

Hi.

What is this?

It's a questionnaire I devised.

I'm having some difficulty bonding
with a colleague at work.

So I'm doing a little research to better understand
why my current friends like me.

Yes. Well, that is a good question.

But is this really the best way to figure it out?

Yeah, I agree.
The social sciences are largely hokum.

But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring
your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.

Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of
Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal.

Intelligence.

Ruthless attention to hygiene.

Playfulness.

Java applet writing?

I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one.

You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness.

Why just go ahead and rank that number 1.

I'm afraid you're on your own for the rest.

It should take you no more than 3 hours.

Wait! How many questions are on this thing?

Only 211.

Don't worry, in deference to you,
I've kept them on a high school graduate reading level.

Thanks pal.

You got it...

Buddy.

Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends
by being, I don't know, pleasant?

Well that's certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis.

May I suggest it as the topic for your... essay.

(Tuts)

Your questionnaire, very disappointing.

I answered every question Sheldon.

You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern.

A B B A C. A B B A C.

Aw, you picked up on that huh?

How could I not?

Come on! There's over 200 questions.

And look at some of these things.

Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?

There are a number of acceptable answers,

for example, C: near earth's transport, but certainly not B: avocado rancher.

And your essay, suggesting that I'd have better luck
making friends if I wait 'til the Cylons take over?

Please.

Hold on. I put some real work into that!

Yes, well it's better than what Wolowitz did.

He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.

It's kinda cute.

Until you get to the scrotum.

What hope do I have for establishing new relationships
given that my current friends apparently cannot take
a few hours out of their lives to help me?

Sheldon, I'm not going to defend a big bald raccoon.

I don't see how you could.

What I'm trying to say is that, maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.

What do you mean!?

Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?

I did learn how to swim.

On the floor.

The skills are transferrable.

I just have no interest in going in the water.

Then why learn how to swim?

The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn't going to be optional.

But you do bring up an interesting point.

I don't have to break new ground here.

I'm sure much of the research already exists.

No... no, my point is, if you wanna learn how to make friends,

then just go out to a coffee shop,

or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them.
Take an interest in their lives.

That's insane on the face of it.

Come on.

Where are we going?

You're driving me to the mall.

I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes
the current theories in the field of friendmaking.

Why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there?

Coping with the death of a loved one.

My condolences.

Thank you.

Family or friend?

Family.

Too bad.

If it'd been a friend, I'm available to fill the void.

It's just as well, she smelled like moth balls.

Okay, if you're gonna start sniffing people, I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel.

Excuse me.

Do you have any books about making friends?

Uhm, yeah but they're all for little kids.

I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.

Uh, I guess.

They're right over there by the wooden train set.

Oh! I love trains!

I bet you do.

Oh my! That's awfully sticky.

Alright... Let's see.

Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now.

It's probably about homosexual rabbits.

Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus.

Read it, not helpful.

Oh! Here we go.

Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo.

Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her
husband and bestfriend Mark.

And their cockatoos too.

Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn't you agree?

I don't like birds, they scare me.

Me too!

Most people don't see it.

What are you reading?

Curious George.

Oh I do like monkeys!

Curious George is a monkey.

Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes.

Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see
monkeys together. Would you like that?

Okay.

Sheldon, what are you doing?

I'm making friends with this little girl.

What's your name?

Rebecca.

Hi Rebecca, I'm your new friend, Sheldon.

No you're not, let's go.

We were really hitting it off.

Don't look up, there's cameras.

I'm curious. In the "How Well Do You Know Sheldon" section,
what do you put for his favorite amino acid?

(Leonard and Howard at the same time)
Lysine.

Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.

Oh good! You're just in time.

I believe I've isolated the algorithm for making friends.

Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!

Hear him out. If he's really on to something,
we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.

See, my initial approach to Kripke,
had the same deficiencies

as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo.

Stu the cockatoo?

Yes, he's new at the zoo.

It's a terrific book. I've distilled its essence into a
simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.

Have you thought about putting him in a crate
while you're out of the apartment?

Hello, Kripke. Sheldon Cooper here.

It occurred to me you hadn't returned any of my calls

because I hadn't offered any concrete
suggestions for pursuing our friendship.

Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together...

I see.

Well then perhaps you'd have time for a hot beverage.

Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa...

I see.

No, no, no, wait. Don't hang up yet.

What about a recreational activity?

I bet we share some common interests.

Tell me an interest of yours.

Really? On actual horses?

Tell me another interest of yours.

Oh no, I'm sorry, I have no desire to get
in the water until I absolutely have to.

Tell me another interest of yours.

Uh-oh, he's stuck in an infinite loop.

I can fix it.

Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It's interesting.
But isn't ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity?

Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours.

Hmmm.

Is there any chance you like monkeys?

What is wrong with you?
Everybody likes monkeys.

Hang on, Kripke.

A loop counter? And an escape to
the least objectionable activity!

Howard, that's brilliant! I'm surprised you saw that.

Gee. Why can't Sheldon make friends?

Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me
as the least objectionable

and I would like to propose that we do that together.

Tomorrow.

Yes, I'll pay.

Alright, goodbye.

Alright!

Time to learn rock climbing.

You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism.

Maybe you, me and your dummy
could go get a hot beverage.

He could talk while you drink.

No, I wanna climb some rocks.

This appears significantly more...
monolithic than it did on my laptop.

No one expects to see Hominids
learning to use bones as weapeons.

You afraid of heights, Cooper?

Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical.

Fear of falling, on the other hand,
is prudent and evolutionary.

What would you say is the minimum altitude
I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?

Come on, they have birthday parties here.
Little kids climb this.

Little kid Hominids, perhaps.

Is this your entire job?

Your parents must be so proud.

Let's go, Cooper.

Coming, Kripke.

Okay. Harness seems to be secure.

Small amount of incontinence just now,
but the website said that's to be expected.

Hey, this isn't so bad.

I feel like vertical swimming.

Hey, look at you, Cooper.
You're almost halfway to the top.

I am?

I was wrong.
It IS a fear of heights.

You alright there, Cooper?

Not really.

I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function
that's approaching an asymptote.

Are you saying you're stuck?

What part of an inverse tangent function
approaching an asymptote did you not understand?

Understood all that. I'm not a moron.

Just keep going.

Yeah, I don't think I can.

Well, then. Climb back down.

No, that doesn't seem any more likely.

So what's the plan, Cooper?

Well, it's not exactly a plan
but I think I'm going to pass out.

I'm sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?

Okay.

1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and...

(Whistling altogether)

It's a little thing but you really do miss it.

Hello, everyone.

I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.

Oh...

Hello to you, too.

How was rock climbing?

He passed out.
Just hung there like a big salami.

That's where I sit.

Ooh, you have a special spot.
What kind of wacko are you?

How much time you got?

Want some Chinese food?

Terrific. Got any dental floss?

In the bathroom.

Be right back.

I gotta floss the Indian food out of my teeth
if I'm gonna eat Chinese.

Sheldon, are you okay?

Oh yes, I pass out all the time.

But, it was worth it.

I've made substantial progress in bonding
with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.

What's that?

Maintaining five friendships promises
to be a Herculean task. So...

I'm going to have to let one of you go.

Me, me. Let it be me.

Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation

and you help me fold my sheets
when they come out of the dryer.

You are safe.

Can I whistle?

Don't be silly.

Howard, you do not have a PhD.

Your cologne is an assault on the senses

and you're not available for video games
during the Jewish high holidays.

Guilty as charged. I'm out.

No. You, too, are safe.

Oh come on. What do I have to do?

Okay. You know what? I see where this is going.

I'm not one of you guys. I'm not a scientist.
So just-

Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you're saying is true,
but please allow me to continue.

Raj, you're out.

The good question.

While you do provide a certain cultural diversity
to an otherwise homogenous group,

your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing.

How could you, for a moment,
think that my favorite amino acid is Glutamine?

He had Lysine but changed it.

Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.

I like to floss before I eat.
So my gum pockets are open for new food.

Eww.

Hello.

How did I walk past you?

I'm Barry.

Penny.

Yeah, it's not a very hot name.

I'm gonna call your Roxanne.

Suddenly I'm looking pretty good, huh?

So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there's any chance

you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.

No.

No? But we're friends!

I'm sorry.
No, my friend?

I'm confused. I was given an understanding that
you allow your friends time on the machine?

No, that's wrong. There's an official schedule.
I have no control over it.

Oh. This entire endeavor seems
to have been an exercise in futility.

Raj, you're back in.

He likes monkeys.

You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.

I didn't think he had it in him.

He almost made it to the top this time.



about time travel again.

Why? Did you hit a roadblock
with invisibility?

Put it on the back burner.

Anyway, it occurs to me,
if I ever did perfect a time machine...

I'd go into the past
and give it to myself.

Thus eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

 Interesting.
 Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.

Sounds like a breakthrough.

Should I call Science
and tell them to hold the cover?

It's time travel, Leonard.
I will have done that.

I guess congratulations are in order.

No, congratulations
will have been in order.

You know,
I'm not going to enjoy this party.

I know, I'm familiar with you.

Professor Finkleday cornered me...

and talked about spelunking
for 45 minutes.

Yes, I was there.

You know what's interesting
about caves?

 What?
 Nothing.

We'll avoid Finkleday, meet the new head,
congratulate him, shake his hand and go.

"Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser.

How fortunate for you
the university has chosen to hire you...

despite the fact you've done
no original research in 25 years...

and instead have written books...

that reduce the great concepts
of science to anecdotes...

each one dumbed down...

to accommodate the duration
of an average bowel movement."


 "Mahalo" is a nice touch.
 Hmm.

Only eight consonants
in the Hawaiian language.

Interesting, you should lead with that.

Oh, God, look at this buffet.

I love America.

 You don't have buffets in India?
 Of course, but it's all Indian food.

You can't find a bagel in Mumbai
to save your life.

Smear me.

 Well, here's an interesting turn of events.
 What?

Howard brought a date?

A more plausible explanation is that his
work in robotics has made an amazing leap.

Hey, what up, science bitches?

May I introduce my special lady friend,
Summer.

Howard, I told you, touching's extra.

Right. Sorry.

Here comes our new boss. Be polite.

Hi, fellas.

 Eric Gablehauser.
 Howard Wolowitz.

Howard, nice to meet you. And you are?

An actual real scientist.

How was that?

I can't believe he fired me.

You did call him
a glorified science teacher...

whose last successful experiment
was lighting his own farts.

In my defense, I prefaced that by saying
"with all due respect."

Morning.

You're making eggs for breakfast?

This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.

Oh. Because it looks a lot like breakfast.

I finally have time to test my hypothesis
about the separation of water molecules...

from the egg proteins
and its impact vis-à-vis taste.

Sounds yummy.

I look forward to your work with bacon.

As do I.

You know, I'm sure if you just apologize
to Gablehauser he'd give your job back.

I don't want my job back.

I've spent three and a half years
staring at grease boards full of equations.

Before that,
I spent four years working on my thesis.

Before that, I was in college,
and before that I was in the fifth grade.

This is my first day off in decades
and I'm going to savor it.

Okay. I'll let you get back
to fixing your eggs.

I'm not just fixing my eggs,
I'm fixing everyone's eggs.

And we all thank you.



Use new eggs.


Hi, I'm running out to the market.
Do you guys need anything?

Oh. This would be
one of those circumstances...

people unfamiliar with the law
of large numbers would call a coincidence.

 I'm sorry?
 I need eggs.

 Four dozen should suffice.
 Four dozen?

Evenly distributed amongst brown, white,
free-range, large, extra-large and jumbo.

 Okay, one more time?
 Never mind, you won't get it right.

I'd better come with you.

Oh, yay.

How come
you didn't go in to work today?

I'm taking a sabbatical because
I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.

So you got canned, huh?

Theoretical physicists do not get canned.

But, yeah.

Maybe it's for the best.

You know, I always say, "When one door
closes, another one opens."

No, it doesn't.

Not unless the doors
are connected by relays.

 Or there are motion sensors involved.
 No, I meant...

Or if the first door closing creates a change
of air pressure that acts upon the second.

Never mind.

Slow down. Slow down.
Please, slow down.

We're fine.

You're not leaving
enough space between cars.

Oh, sure I am.

No, no, let me do the math for you.

This car weighs, let's say, 4000 pounds.

Now, add 140 for me, 120 for you...

 One-twenty?
 Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you?

Is your body mass
somehow tied into your self-worth?

Well, yeah.

Interesting.

Anyway, that gives us a total weight of,
let's say, 4400 pounds.

Let's say 4390.

Fine.

We're traveling forward at...
Good Lord... 51 miles an hour.

Let's assume that your brakes are new
and the calipers are aligned.

By the time we come to a stop...

we'll be occupying the same space
as that Buick.

An impossibility that nature will quickly
resolve into death, mutilation and...

Oh, look,
they built a new putt-putt course.

This is great.

Look at me.
I'm in the real world of ordinary people...

just living their ordinary,
colorless, work-a-day lives.

 Thank you.
 No, thank you.

And thank you, ordinary person.

Hey, you wanna hear an interesting thing
about tomatoes?

No. No, not really.

Listen, didn't you say
you needed some eggs?

Yes, but anyone who knows anything
about bacterial growth...

knows to pick up their refrigerated foods
on the way out.

Oh, okay, maybe you should start
heading on out, then.

No, this is fun.

The thing about tomatoes,
and I think you'll enjoy this...

is they're shelved with the vegetables,
but they're technically a fruit.

 Hmm. Interesting.
 Isn't it?

No, I mean what you find enjoyable.

Oh, boy.

What now?

Well, there's some value
to taking a multivitamin...

but the human body
can only absorb so much.

What you're buying here
are the ingredients for very expensive urine.

Well, maybe that's what I was going for.

Well, then you'll want some manganese.

Well, that was fun.

Tomorrow we can go
to one of those warehouse stores.

I don't know, Sheldon.

It's gonna take me a while to recover
from all the fun I had today.

Are you sure? There are a lot
of advantages to buying in bulk.

For example, I noticed
you purchase your tampons...

one month's supply at a time.

 What?
 Well, think about it.

It doesn't spoil...

and you're going to be needing them
for at least the next 30 years.

You want me to buy
30 years' worth of tampons?

Well, 30, 35...

 When did your mother go into menopause?
 Okay.

I'm not talking about this with you.

Oh, Penny.

This is a natural human process
and we're talking about significant savings.

Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle
in a 28-day cycle...

Are you fairly regular?

Okay, no warehouse store,
but we're still on for putt-putt golf, right?


Hey, I just ran into Penny.
She seemed upset about something.

I think it's her time of the month.

I marked the calendar
for future reference.

What's with the fish?

It's an experiment.

 What happened to your egg research?
 Oh, that was a dead end.

Scrambled eggs are as good
as they're ever going to be.

So fish.

I read an article about scientists
who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish...

into other animals, and I thought,
"Hey, fish nightlights."

Fish nightlights.

It's a billion-dollar idea. Shhh!

Mum's the word.

Are you sure you don't wanna just apologize
to Gablehauser and get your job back?

Oh, no, no, no.
No, I have too much to do.

Like luminous fish.

 Shhh!
 I'm sorry, I didn't...

That's just the beginning.

I also have an idea for a bulk,
mail-order feminine hygiene company.

Oh, glow-in-the-dark tampons.

Leonard, we're gonna be rich.

 Thanks for coming on such short notice.
 You did the right thing calling.

I didn't know what to do.
He's lost all focus.

Every day, he's got a new obsession.

This is a particularly disturbing one.

Mommy?

Hi, baby.

You called my mother?

Oh, you got yourself a loom. How nice.

 Thank you.
 Honey, why did you get a loom?

I was working with luminous fish
and I thought, "Hey...

loom."

Mom, what are you doing here?

Leonard called me.

I know, but why?

Because one of the great minds
of the 21 st century...

is raising glow-in-the-dark fish
and weaving serapes.

This is not a serape. This is a poncho.

A serape is open at the sides,
a poncho is closed. This is a poncho.

And neither is a reason
to call someone's mother.

Really?
When was the last time you left the house?

I went to the market with Penny.

Yeah, that was three weeks ago.

Well, then, buckle up.

In the next four to eight days,
she's going to get very crabby.

Sweetheart,
your little friend is concerned about you.

Yes, well, I'm not a child.

I'm a grown man
capable of living my life as I see fit.

And I certainly don't need someone
telling on me to my mother.

Wait, where are you going?

To my room and no one's allowed in.


 He gets his temper from his daddy.
 Ah.

 He's got my eyes.
 I see.

All that science stuff,
that comes from Jesus.

Sheldon, your mom made dinner.

I'm not hungry.

Oh. Leonard, don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.

He may stay in there till the rapture.

Are we so sure that's a bad thing?

I love the boy to death...

but he has been difficult
since he fell out of me at the Kmart.

Excuse me for being so bold...

but I now see where Sheldon gets
his smoldering good looks.

Oh. Honey, that ain't gonna work,
but you keep trying.

I made chicken.

I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.

You know, we have an Indian gentleman
at our church.

A Dr. Patel. It's a beautiful story.

The Lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20 percent off on LASEK.

You know, those that needed it.

That is a lovely story.

Are we gonna do anything
about Sheldon?

Oh, we will.
You have to take your time with Sheldon.

His father, God rest his soul, used to say:

"Mary, you have to take your time
with Sheldon."

 Sounds like a wise man.
 Oh, not so wise.

He once tried to fight a bobcat
for some licorice.

So everybody grab a plate
and a pretty placemat that Shelly wove.

Has Shelly ever freaked out
like this before?

Oh, all the time.

I remember one summer
when he was 13...

he built a small nuclear reactor
in the shed...

and told everybody he was gonna provide
electricity for the town.

Well, the only problem was, he had no,
what you call, fissionable materials.

Anyway, when he went on the Internet
to get some...

a man from the government came by
and sat him down real gentle...

and told him it's against the law
to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.

 Well, what happened?
 Well, poor boy had a fit.

Locked himself in his room
and built a sonic death ray.

 A death ray?
 Well, that's what he called it.

Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.
Heh.

It pissed our dog off to no end.

You know, you two make a cute couple.


I... No, no.
No, we're not a couple. We're singles.

Two singles. Like those individually
wrapped slices of cheese that...

Or friends.

 Did I pluck a nerve there?
 Oh, yeah.

Okay.
All right, everybody, it's time to eat.

Oh, Lord, we thank you for this meal
and for all your bounty.

And we pray that you help Sheldon
get back on his rocker.

Now, after a moment of silent meditation,
I'm gonna end with "in Jesus' name"...

but you two
don't feel any obligation to join in.

Unless, of course,
the Holy Spirit moves you.

Oh, my God,
this is the best cobbler I've ever had.

It was always Sheldon's favorite.
You know what the secret ingredient is?

 Love?
 Lard.

 Hey, look who's com...
 Shh. You'll spook him.

He's like a baby deer.
You gotta let him come to you.

This is ridiculous.

Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it.

You're a physicist. You belong at the
university doing research, not in your room.


You don't hunt, do you?


Good morning, Snickerdoodle.

 Morning.
 Oh.

Well, that looks awful fancy.
What is that?

It's my idea of what DNA would look like
in a silicon-based life form.

But intelligently designed
by a creator, right?

What do you want, Mom?

You know how your daddy used to say
that you can only fish for so long...

before you gotta throw
a stick of dynamite in the water?

 Yeah?
 Well, I'm done fishing.

 You put those on.
 What for?

Because you're gonna go
to your office...

apologize to your boss
and get your job back.

 No.
 I'm sorry.

Did I start that sentence with the words
"if it please Your Highness"?

I'm not going to.
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

Now, you listen here.

I have been telling you since you were 4.

It's okay to be smarter than everybody,
but you can't go around pointing it out.

 Why not?
 Because people don't like it.

Remember all the ass-kickings
from the neighbor kids?

Now, let's get cracking.

Shower, shirt, shoes and let's shove off.

Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings
if that stupid death ray had worked.

Problem solved.

Really? That's impressive.

Leonard, the Lord never gives us
more than we can handle.

Thankfully, he blessed me
with two other children...

who are dumb as soup.

Excuse me, Dr. Gablehauser,
are you busy?

 Well, actually...
 Sheldon, he's just doodling. Get in here.

 Dr. Gablehauser.
 Dr. Cooper.

Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight.

Um...

As you know, several weeks ago
in our first encounter...

we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot...

when I called you an idiot.

And I just wanted to say
that I was wrong...

to point it out.

I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.

 Dr. Eric Gablehauser.
 Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom.

Now, that's impossible. You must've
had him when you were a teenager.

Oh, aren't you sweet. His father's dead.

 Recently?
 Long enough.

Please.

Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?

Okay.

Hey, how did it go?

I got my job back.

Really? What happened?

I'm not quite sure.

It involves a part of the human experience
that has always eluded me.

Well, that narrows it down.

I'm very proud of you, honey.
You showed a lot of courage today.

Thanks, Mom.

 Mom?
 Mm-hm.

Is Dr. Gablehauser
going to be my new daddy?

We'll see. Sleep tight.



Okay.

The X Tens are online.

Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal
from this laptop through our local ISP...

racing down fiber-optic cable
at the speed of light to San Francisco...

bouncing off a satellite in
geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal.

Data packets will be handed off
to submerged transatlantic cables...

terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia...

and transferred across the continent
via microwave relays back to our ISP...

and the external receiver attached
to this...

lamp.

Look at me, look at me,
I've got goose bumps.

 Are we ready on the stereo?
 Go for stereo.






 Hey, guys.

It's a little loud.

No problem. Turning it down.

San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax:

Voilà.

Okay, thanks.

Hang on, hang on.
Do you not realize what we just did?

Yeah, you turned your stereo down
with your laptop.

No, we turned our stereo down by sending
a signal around the world via the Internet.

Oh. Get one of those
universal remotes at RadioShack.

They're really cheap.

No. You don't get it.

Howard, enable public access.

Public access enabled.

 Boy, that's terrific, but I'll see you.
 No, hang on.


See?

No.

Someone in Sichuan Province, China...

is using his computer
to turn our lights on and off.

Huh. Well, that's handy.

Um, here's a question. Why?

Because we can.

Oh! They found the remote-control cars.

 But wait, wait, what's on top of them?
 Wireless webcams. Wave hello.

The monster truck
is out of Austin, Texas...

and the blue Viper is being operated
from suburban Tel Aviv.

You may wanna put on slacks.

What?

Ew! Stop it. No. Leave me alone.


 Who's running the red Corvette?
 That would be me.

You know, in the future,
when we're disembodied brains in jars...

we're going to look back on this
as eight hours well wasted.

I don't wanna be in a jar.
I want my brain in an android body.

Eight feet tall and ripped.

I'm with you. I just have to make sure
if I'm a synthetic human, I'd still be Jewish.

I promised my mother.

I suppose you could have
your android penis circumcised.

That's something your rabbi would have
to discuss with the manufacturer.

Not to mention
you'd have to power down on Saturdays.

Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?

Well, there's always the possibility...

that a trash can spontaneously
formed around the letter...

but Ockham's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.

It's from the Institute
for Experimental Physics.

They want us to present our
paper on the properties of supersolids...

at the Topical Conference
on Bose-Einstein Condensates.

I know. I read it before I threw it out.

Okay, if I may drill down
to the bedrock of my question...

why did you throw it out?

Because I have no interest in standing in
the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott...

in front of a group
of judgmental strangers...

who wouldn't recognize genius if it were
standing in front of them giving a speech.

Which, if I were there, it would be.

I don't know, Sheldon.

Those Topical Conference on Bose-Einstein
Condensates parties are legendary.

Forget the parties.

Forget the parties? What a nerd.

Any other honors I've gotten
that I don't know about?

Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize
with my name on it?

Leonard, don't take this the wrong way,
but the day you win a Nobel Prize...

is the day I begin my research on the
drag coefficient of tassels on flying carpets.

Ha, ha, ha. The only thing missing from
that insult was your mama.

I got one. Hey, Leonard, your mama's
research methodology is so flawed...

Shut up, Howard.

 Sheldon, we have to do this.
 No, we don't.

We have to take in nourishment,
expel waste...

and inhale enough oxygen
to keep our cells from dying.

Everything else is optional.


You can't. I'm the lead author.

Come on, the only reason you're the lead
author is because we went alphabetically.

I let you think we went alphabetically...

to spare you dealing
with the fact that it was my idea.

Not to put too fine a point on it,
but I was throwing you a bone.

You're welcome.

Excuse me, I designed the experiment
that proved the hypothesis.

It doesn't need proving.

So the entire scientific community
is just supposed to just take your word?

They're not supposed to,
but they should.

I don't care what you say.

I'm going to the conference,
presenting our findings.

And I forbid it.

You forbid it?

If I'm not taking credit for our work,
then nobody is.

 So you admit that it's our work?
 No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone.

And once again, you are welcome.


Oh, no, he didn't.

So how's it going with Sheldon?
Are you guys still not talking?

Not only is he still not talking to me,
but he does this thing...

where he stares at you
and tries to get your brain to explode.

You know,
like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?


Never mind.

How about this one?

It says, "I know my physics,
but I'm still a fun guy."

Oh.

Oh, I didn't know
they still made corduroy suits.

They don't. That's why I saved this one.

Okay, well,
let's just see what else you have.

Okay, here.
Take this and this and this...

 ...and these.
 Is this stuff you want me to try on?

No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.

Seriously, don't even give it to charity.
You won't be helping anyone.

What's this?

That's the Bottle City of Kandor.

Uh-huh.

You see, Kandor was the capital city
of the planet Krypton.

It was miniaturized by Brainiac
before Krypton exploded...

and then rescued by Superman.

Oh, nice.

It's a lot cooler
when girls aren't looking at it.

Here, why don't you put these on
while I find a shirt and sport coat?

 Great, be right back.
 Where are you going? Put them on.

 Here?
 Oh, are you shy?

 No, I'm not shy.
 Don't worry, I won't look.

I know you won't. Why would you look?
There's nothing to see. Not noth...

 Sweetie, put the pants on.
 I'm gonna put them on.

So, you know, isn't there some way
you and Sheldon could compromise...

on this presentation thing?

No, no. Scientists do not compromise.

Our minds are trained to synthesize facts
and come to inarguable conclusions.

Not to mention,
Sheldon is bat-crap crazy.

What is this?

Oh, careful.

That's my original series
Battlestar Galactica flight suit.

Oh, why didn't you wear it
on Halloween?

Because it's not a costume.
It's a flight suit.

Okay, all right. Moving on.

Oh, wow, a paisley shirt.

Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.

If you mean it should end up
in the same place, then I agree.

Is this your only tie?

Ah, technically, yes.

But if you'll notice, it's reversible.

So it works as two.

Oh, sweetie,
I don't even think it works as one.

 Is this all your clothes?
 Yup, everything since the eighth grade.

The eighth grade?

My last growth spurt.

Okay, well,
guess we're back to the corduroy suit.

 Great.
 Yup.

I said no. Put it down.


Hey, Sheldon.

Hello, Penny.

Get anything good?

Just the latest copy
of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.

Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.

It was a joke.

Heh-heh.

Yup. Tip your waitresses.
I'm here all week.

To save you from further awkwardness...

know that I'm comfortable with
the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.

Oh, yeah, okay, me too. Zip it, lock it.

Put it in your pocket.

 So you and Leonard...
 Oh, dear God.

Little misunderstanding, huh?

A little misunderstand...?

Galileo and the pope
had a little misunderstanding.

Anyway, I was talking
to Leonard this morning...

and I think he feels really bad about it.

Huh.

Well, how do you feel?

I don't understand the question.

Well, I'm just asking if it's difficult
to be fighting with your best friend.

Oh, I hadn't thought about it like that.

I wonder if I've been experiencing
physiological manifestations...

of some sort
of unconscious emotional turmoil.

Wait, what?

I couldn't poop this morning.

You should just talk to him.
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

 It's certainly preferable to my plan.
 Which was?

A powerful laxative.

Okay, so you absolutely
should talk to him.

I know Leonard values you as a friend.

He told me without your little idea...

there was no way he could've come up
with this whole experiment thing.

Excuse me. Little idea?

Yeah, he tried to explain it to me.
I didn't really understand it...

Of course you didn't.
He said "little idea"?

Oh. Well, no.
I mean, not in those words...

In what words, then, exactly?

The exact words aren't really...

 It's more the spirit in which...
 What did he say?

You had a lucky hunch.

I've been thinking.
Instead of arguing about this, why...?

Don't you ever speak to me again.

What...?

Oh, he:

Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.

 Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch."
 Sheldon, I didn't mean it like that.

 Why did you say it?
 I don't know...

 Were you trying to impress Penny?
 No, no, not at all.

A little bit.

How did that work out for you?

Leonard, ready to go?

Libido, one. Truth, zero.

I'm gonna ask one more time.

We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.

And I'm telling you for the last time,
it's pandering, it's undignified, and bite me.

Let's go.

 Bye, Sheldon.
 Goodbye, Penny.



There you go.

You're right, this side does look better.

No, no, I didn't say better,
I said less stained.

I just checked the house.
There's probably 20, 25 people in there.

 You're kidding.
 Is that all?

All? In particle physics, 25 is Woodstock.

Oh. Well, then, good.

I wasn't expecting such a crowd.
I'm nervous.

 It's okay. Open with a joke, you'll be fine.
 Okay, joke. Okay.

How about this? Um, okay.

There's this farmer,
and he has these chickens...

but they won't lay any eggs.

So he calls a physicist to help.

The physicist then does some calculations
and he says:

"I have a solution, but it only works
for spherical chickens in a vacuum."


Right?

Oh, sorry, I just... I've heard it before.

 Let's roll.
 Okay.

 Hey, nice suit.
 It's a classic, right?

I really should've brought my own car.

So in conclusion, the data show that at
temperatures approaching absolute zero...

the moment of inertia changes
and the solid becomes a supersolid...

which clearly appears to be a previously
unknown state of matter.


Thank you.

 Are there any questions?

What the hell was that?

Any other questions?

Dr. Sheldon Cooper here.
I am the lead author of this particular paper.

Thank you.

And you, sir, you have completely
skipped over the part...

where I was walking through
the park...

and I saw these children
on a merry-go-round...

which started me thinking
about the moment of inertia...

in gasses like helium at temperatures
approaching absolute zero.

I didn't skip it.
It's just an anecdote. It's not science.

Oh, I see. It was the apple falling
on Newton's head.

Was that just an anecdote?

 You are not Isaac Newton.
 No, no, that's true.

Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.

You cannot be that arrogant.

You continue to underestimate me,
my good man.

If you weren't happy with my presentation,
then maybe you should've given it with me.

As I've explained repeatedly, unlike you,
I don't need validation from lesser minds.

 No offense.
 Really? So why did you come?

 Because I knew you'd screw this up.
 I didn't screw it up.

Oh, please. I admit,
that spherical-chicken joke was hilarious.

 Thank you.
 It was straight downhill from there.

I've had enough of your condescension.

Maybe I didn't go to college
when I was 11, like you.

Maybe I got my doctorate at 24
instead of 16.

But you are not the only person who
is smarter than everyone else in this room.

No offense.

And I am clearly not the only person
who is tormented by insecurity...

and has an ego
in need of constant validation.

 So you admit you're an egotist.
 Yes.

My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
I could never please my parents...

so I need to get my self-esteem
from strangers.

But he's worse!

Okay, that is it.

Stop it.

You cannot blow up my head
with your mind.

Then I'll settle for an aneurism.

 Stop it.
 You hit me.

You saw that. He hit me.

 You tried to blow up my head.
 So it was working.

It wasn't... It was not...
You are a nutcase.

We'll see. Heads up, you people
in the front row. This is a splash zone.

Stop it. Stop it.

Quit it.


Is this usually
how these physics things go?

More often than you'd think.

Hit you with a Vulcan nerve pinch.

 No pinches. No...!
 No!


You could have offered me a ride home.

You're lucky I didn't run you over.

I don't understand
what you're unhappy about.

You begged me to come, I came.
There's just no pleasing you.

You're right. I'm the problem,
the one that needs help.

Well, that's not much of an apology,
but I'll take it.

Excuse me.

Is there anything you'd like
to apologize for?

Yes. Ahem.

I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.

It was uncalled for.

You won't believe this.

Somebody got the whole thing
on their cell phone and put it on YouTube.

What?

 Now, who would do that?
 That would be me.

Check it out. It's a featured video.

You hit me. You saw that. He hit me.

 You tried to blow up my head.
 So it was working.

 It was not... You are a nutcase.
 We'll see about that.

You people in the front row, heads up.
This is a splash zone.

Stop it. Quit it. Quit it.


 Hit you with a Vulcan nerve pinch.
 No pinches. No...!

You should clip your fingernails.
Those hurt.

Oh, jeez.

Does this suit really look that bad?

Forget your suit.
Look at my arms waving.

I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.

Howard, would you like
to explain to me...

why your Facebook page has a picture
of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned:

"Me and my girlfriend"?

Uh-oh, here comes the talk.

 He hit me.
 You tried to blow up my head.

 So it was working.
 It was not... You are a nutcase.

We'll see about that.




Oh, boy.

What?

I can't comment without violating
our agreement

that I don't criticize your work.

Then what was "Oh, boy"?

Great restraint on my part.

There's nothing wrong
with the science here.

Perhaps you mean a different
thing than I do

when you say, "Science."

Okay, how's that?

You actually had it right
in the first place

Once again, you've fallen

for one of my classic pranks.

Bazinga!

Now here's a
peculiar e-mail.

The president of the
university wants
me to meet him

at his office tomorrow
morning at 8:00 a.m.

Why?
It doesn't say.

It must be an emergency.

Everyone at the university knows
I eat breakfast at 8:00

and move my bowels at 8:20.

Yes, how did we live
before Twitter?

I guess you'll find out
what it is in the morning.

That's 14 hours away.

For the next 840 minutes,

I'm effectively one
of Heisenberg's particles;

I know where I am or I know
how fast I'm going,

but I can't know both.

Yet how am I supposed
to carry on

with this huge annoying thing
hovering over my head?

Yeah, I know the feeling.

 

Leonard? Leonard?

Leonard?

(sighs)

Sheldon, it's 2:00
in the morning.

Why is everybody keep telling me
what time it is?

Everybody?

You, the president

of the university, his wife,

their sullen teenage daughter.

That entire family is fascinated
by what time it is

and whether people know it.

You went to President Seibert's
house

in the middle of the night?

He didn't respond
to my e-mail,

his phone number
is unlisted.

Tell me what my
other option was.

You could have waited
until morning.

I know, look who I'm talking to.

Do you remember the grant
proposal I submitted

to the National
Science Foundation

to detect slow-moving monopoles

at the magnetic North Pole?

(tinkling)

Hardly a day goes by
when I don't think about it.

Aw, how nice.

Well, a space opened up

at the last minute on the NSF
expedition to the Arctic Circle.

Wait a minute.
(toilet flushes)

He offered to send you
to the North Pole?

Yes.

In fact, he was quite
enthusiastic.

He said, "Frankly,

if I could send you tonight,
I would."

Okay, well, do you
want to go?

Of course not.

I'm a theoretical physicist.

A career I chose in no small
part because it's indoors,

but if I'm able to detect

slow-moving magnetic
monopoles there,

I will be the scientis
to confirm string theory.

People will write
books about me.

Third-graders will create
macaroni-art dioramas

depicting scenes
from my life.

Sure, maybe a tableau of me
trying to pummel you to death.

Sarcasm?

Maybe.

I'm on the horns of a dilemma.

Can you imagine me, Sheldon
Cooper, at the North Pole?

Easy peasy, I'm doing it
right now.

I'm not good
with cold, Leonard.

How often have we had
to leave a movie theater

because I got a headache

from drinking
the Icee too fast?

I can't go.

Well, then don't go.

How can you say that?

The scientific opportunity
of a lifetime

presents itself and my best
friend says "Don't go."

All right, then go.

Listen to you.

How can I possibly go?

Sheldon, what are the words
I can say right now

to end this conversation
and let me go back to sleep?

Odd, President Seibert posed
the exact same question.

How was it resolved?

It wasn't.
His wife set their dogs on me

and rendered the question moot.

Just imagine.
If he says yes,

we'll have an entire
summer without Sheldon.

We could play outside.

We could sit on the left side

of the couch.

I could use the bathroom
at 8:20.

Our dreams are very small,
aren't they?

Good news, gentlemen,
I have tentatively accepted...

ALL:
Yeah!

Whoo-hoo!

the invitation to join
the Arctic Expedition.

It's not gonna be
the same without you.
Godspeed.

Thank you,

but your sentiments
may be premature.

Ooh, I don't like
where this is going.

I would like to propose...

that the three of
you accompany me.

To the North Pole?

Yes.

Is this just so
we won't touch your stuff

while you're away?

I'll admit that
was a concern.

But the fact is,

I'll need a support team.

And the three of you

are my first choice.

Really?

Well, there are others
who might be more qualified,

but the thought of interviewing
them gave me a stomachache.

Now, I know I'm proposing
an enormous undertaking,

so why don't you take a few
moments to discuss it?

We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole

with him, are we?

SHELDON:
I'm still within earshot!

You may want to wait
for my door to close.

(door closes)

We're not really gonna go

to the North Pole
with him, are we?

Hang on. Let's talk about it.

This is a National Science
Foundation expedition.

I don't know how
we can turn it down.

Easy. Instead of saying,
"No, we don't want to go
on an NSF expedition,"

say, "No, we don't
want to spend

"three months stuck in a
cabin in the Arctic Circle

with an anal nutbag."

But if we were part of the team
that confirmed string theory,

we could drink for free in
any bar in any college town

with a university that has
a strong science program.

Howard, this is big science.

You could be the engineer
who builds the equipment

that puts us on the cover
of magazines.

I could also be the engineer

who builds the crossbow
that kills Sheldon.

You still might
get on a magazine.

So you guys are seriously
considering this?

Yes.
And you think you can
put up with Sheldon?

Well, I'm a Hindu.

My religion teaches that
if we suffer in this life

we are rewarded in the next.

Three months at the
North Pole with Sheldon,

and I'm reborn as a well-hung
billionaire with wings!

Well, gentlemen, have you
reached a decision?

I'm in.

Me, too.

Oh, damn it.
Peer pressure. Fine.

Excellent.

Just an FYI,

as I am the expedition's
team leader,

protocol dictates that
be phrased, "Fine, sir."

But don't worry,

there will be a briefing.

(imitates gunshot)

Penny.

(knocking)
Sheldon.

Penny.

(knocking)
Sheldon.

Penny.

(knocking)
Sheldon.

Penny.

(knocking)
Sheldon.

Penny!

(knocking)
Sheldon!

Penny!

What do you want?

I need access to the Cheesecake
Factory's walk-in freezer.

Now, honey, I already told you,
the hamburger meat is fresh and
stored at a safe temperature.

No. This is to train for a
three-month expedition to
the magnetic North Pole.

What?

I don't know how that sentence

could possibly confuse you...

but to elaborate, I'm
going to the Arctic Circle

with Leonard, Wolowitz
and Koothrappali.

You're all going?

Yes.
For three months?

Yes.

Excuse me.

Is that a yes or
a no on the freezer?

The woman has the
attention span of a gnat.

PENNY:
Hey, Leonard.
Hey.

Sheldon says you're going
to the North Pole.

Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

Yeah. I'm just a little
surprised you didn't tell me.

Oh, well, it all happened
kind of fast.

And we had to get physicals
and buy thermal underwear

and study up on, you know,
snow and stuff.

Sorry, I was gonna tell you.

Oh, hey, no, you don't
have to apologize.

There's no reason
you have to tell me.

I was just...
you know, surprised.

Yes, yes, you were busy,

you were surprised,
all very fascinating.

Now where do we stand
on the freezer?

Is he serious?

Actually, it would help.

All right, I'll see
what I can do.

So, three months
at the North Pole.

Wow, that is...

awesome.

Yeah.

I'm sorry, but at what
point do you put this

"see what you can do"
plan into action?

Just a warning, Sheldon--

The freezer locks
from the outside.

Did she seem upset to you?
No.

Did she seem upset to you?
No.

Oh, good, I got it right.

Are you upset?

A little bit.

Two for two.
I'm on fire.

I mean, I know she's not
my girlfriend or anything,

but wouldn't you think
she'd feel a little bad

that I'm going to be gone
for the whole summer?

That feels like
a bonus question.

I'm going to stop here
while I'm ahead,

but I had a great time.

is to acclimate us
to the use of tools

in extreme temperatures

such as we will face
in the Arctic Circle.

Where are your tools?

Right here.

All right, team, open
up your practice kits.

As the university
did not permit me

to bring the actual
equipment we'll be using

to the Cheesecake Factory,
because apparently,

I'm "ridiculous,"

I've provided substitutes

which will exercise
your fine motor skills.

Leonard, you will
be doing a series

of complex mathematical problems

on a vintage Casio model

1175 calculator
watch I received

when I won the Earth Science
medal in 3rd grade.

Treat it with respect.

Raj, you will be painting

sideburns and a Van Dyke

on a six-inch figurine
of Legolas the elf.

Now, remember,

a Van Dyke is a goatee
without a mustache.

Wolowitz, you will be completing

a series of delicate
surgical procedures

on the classic children's
game "Operation."

To begin with, you will

"remove funny bone for
two hundred dollars."

For this I went to MIT.

And begin.

(groaning)

I think I swallowed some paint!

I can't press any of the
buttons with my gloves.

Oh, son of a bitch!

Adversity is to be expected.

Continue.

(game buzzing)
Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.

Okay, I can't do this.

Me either.

Gentlemen, use your imagination.

Innovate.

Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker

freeze to death on the
ice planet of Hoth?

No.

He cut open a tauntaun

and used its internal
body heat to warm him up.

You heard the man.

Hold him down
and I'll cut him open.

Hang on, I know I don't possess
the tools of leadership,

but I don't understand why we
can't assemble the equipment

inside the hut and
then take it outside.

I hadn't thought of that.

I guess we're done here.

Here, drink slash eat this.

What is it?

Hot chocolate
with a stick of butter.

Okay, why?

Because in the frigid
temperatures in the Arctic,

we need to consume at least
5,000 calories a day

just to maintain
our body weight.

Sheldon, you know
I can't eat butter.

I'm lactose intolerant.

Way ahead of you, that's an

"I Can't Believe
It's Not Butter" stick.

But all the other guys
are going to the North Pole.

I don't care what the
other guys are doing.

If the other guys jumped
in the Bay of Bengal

and tried to swim to Sri Lanka,

would you follow them?

If you were standing
behind me nagging, I might.

Don't talk back
to your mother.

This trip is much too
dangerous, Rajesh.

No, it's not.

Howard, tell them.

Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali,
namaste.

I understand your concern,

but if it'll make
you feel any better,

my mother is fine with me going,

and this is a woman
who kept a safety rail

on my bed until I was 17.

So, she has no problem

with her son being
eaten by a walrus?

That's very unlikely,
Mrs. Koothrappali.

If Raj dies,

it'll be from frostbite,
gangrene, acute sunburn

or being ripped to shreds
by a 1,500 pound polar bear.

Ma, I'm putting you
on speakerphone

with Raj's parents.

Can you tell them
that you're okay

with me going to the Arctic?

Arctic?!

I thought you said Arkansas!

I didn't say that.

You never listen to me!

He doesn't tell me anything!

He lives a secret life
because he's ashamed!

Hey, Leonard, can I talk
to you for a sec?

Sure, but let's
go out here
(Wolowitz's mom ranting)

where there's a little
less yelling and guilt.

What's up?

Well, I got you a little
going away present.

Oh, a blanket.

Oh, no, no, no,
not just a blanket.

See, it has sleeves.

Yeah!

So, you can, you know,
be all snoodled up

while you do
your science stuff.

Oh, wow, cool.

Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

See you later.
Bye.

MRS. KOOTHRAPALI:
I told you no!

Why don't you believe me?

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
'Cause it doesn't
make sense to me!

How can it be that
in the entire country
of India,

there isn't one
Outback Steakhouse?!

(knocking on door)

Sheldon... Sheldon?

I want a cookie, Meemaw.

Sheldon, it's me.

But Meemaw just made cookies.

Listen, I don't know if
I can go on the expedition.

What?

I don't think I can
go to the North Pole.

Okay, Leonard,

I know you're concerned
about disappointing me

but I want you to take
comfort from the knowledge

that my expectations
of you are very low.

Yeah, that's very comforting.

Comforting is a part
of leadership.

It's not a part I care for,
but such is my burden.

Terrific, it's just that

I don't think Penny
wants me to go.

Assuming that's a valid reason
not to go, which it isn't,

how do you know this?

Did she say it?

Not exactly.

But she said she was gonna
miss me and she gave me this.

What is it?

It's a blanket with sleeves.

Oh, that's clever.

Let me see if I understand
this correctly.

Her missing you
is an emotional state

you find desirable?

Yes, obviously.
All right.

Well, given that missing you
is predicated on you leaving,

logic dictates you must leave.

Yes, okay, but I'm gonna
be gone for three months.

What if she doesn't miss me that
long and she meets someone else?

She does have a short
attention span.

So, I can't go.

Leonard, you may be right.

It appears that Penny
secretly wants you

in her life in a very
intimate and carnal fashion.

You really think so?

Of course not.

Even in my sleep-deprived
state, I've managed to

pull off another one
of my classic pranks.

Bazinga!

Oh, Leonard, what time is it?

It's 7:00 a.m.
I'm sorry it's early,

but we're leaving soon,
and I needed to talk to you.

Okay.

What did you mean when you
said you're going to miss me?

Um, I don't know.

You'll be gone and I'll notice.

Okay, well, um, what about this?

What does this mean?

Wine, credit card
and late night television

are a bad combination.

All right, fine.

What about that really long hug?

What did that mean?

That wasn't a long hug.

It was at least
five Mississippis.

A standard hug is
two Mississippis tops.

Leonard, I don't know
what to tell you.

It was just a hug.

Glad we cleared that up.

Yeah.

I guess I'll see you.

Okay, have a safe trip.

Thank you. Bye.

Okay, bye.

(sighs)

Means I wish you weren't going.

Damn it.

What?

We're out of ice.

All right, men,
we begin initial assembly

and deployment of
the testing equipment

starting tomorrow at 0700 hours,

but until then,
you are all off duty.

I suggest you keep

the shenanigans to a minimum

as medical help is
18 hours away by dogsled.

What are you working on?

Crossbow.

Hey, guys, can I
just say something?

How about we take a
moment to think about

where we are right now?

This is literally

the top of the world.

Only a handful of people
in all of human history

will ever see what
we are going to see.

He's right.

Yeah, wow.

It is remarkable.

So, who's up for a movie?

Good idea, what do you think?

Ice Station Zebra or
John Carpenter's The Thing?

I say double feature.

Dinner's ready!

What are we having?

Reconstituted Thai food.

Did you bring the
dehydrated low-sodium

soy sauce?
Check.

Freeze-dried
spicy mustard?
Check.

Flash-frozen brown
rice, not white?

Uh, oh, sorry.

Not to worry.

(laughing):
I hid it.

Bazinga!

You're in my spot.

There's no time
for a crossbow.

Find me an icicle.

Three months.
This is gonna be great!




Well, this sandwich
is an unmitigated disaster.

I asked for turkey and roast beef...

 ...with lettuce and Swiss on whole wheat.
 What'd they give you?

Turkey and roast beef
with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.

It's the right ingredients
but in the wrong order.

In a proper sandwich,
the cheese is adjacent to the bread...

to create a moisture barrier
against the lettuce.

They might as well have dragged this thing
through a car wash.

 I don't believe it.
 I know. It's basic culinary science.

Some guy is auctioning off
a miniature time-machine prop...

from the original film
and no one is bidding.

A time machine
from the movie The Time Machine?

No, a time machine
from Sophie's Choice.

Boy, Sophie could have used
a time machine in that movie.

Did you see it? It's rough.


 It's only $800?
 Yeah. And that's my bid.

 You bid $800?
 It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

I figured it would go for thousands,
and I just wanted to be a part of it.

 There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
 Do you have $800?

 Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
 Don't worry.

People wait until the last second,
then they get it. It's called sniping.

 Fifteen seconds.
 Come on, snipers.

 Ten, nine, eight...
 Where are your snipers?

 Five.
 Snipe.

 Four.
 Snipe.

 Three, two.
 Snipe, snipe.

 One.
 Ah!

Oh. Congratulations, you are the proud
owner of a miniature time machine.

 You lucky duck.

I wonder why no one else bid.

This is a classic piece
of sci-fi movie memorabilia.

I know. But I still can't afford it.

Why don't we share it?
We'll each put in 200 bucks...

 ...and take turns having it in our house.
 A time-share time machine.

 I'm in. Sheldon?
 Wha...? Need you ask?

But I still don't understand
why no one else bid.

I understand why no one else bid.

Did the listing actually say "miniature"?

I just assumed.

Well, who sells a full-sized time machine
for $800?

In a Venn diagram,
that would be an individual located...

within the intersection of
"no longer want time machine"...

and "need $800."

It's actually a tremendous bargain.

Even with shipping,
it works out to less than $4 a pound.

Cocktail shrimp are 12.50.

How are we gonna get it upstairs?

If we take the dish off,
it might fit in the elevator.

Yes, but the elevator's been broken
for two years.

I've been meaning to ask you, do you think
we should make a call about that?

Not necessary.
I have a Master's in engineering.

I remotely repair satellites
on a regular basis.

I troubleshoot space-shuttle payloads.

When the Mars rover
started pulling to the left...

I performed a front-end alignment
from 62 million miles away.

No, that baby's broken.

Come on, guys, push.

I'm gonna give birth to my colon.

I can't feel my fingers. Hurry up.

It's the same amount of work,
no matter how fast you go. Basic physics.

 Yeah?

I've got a job for the middle one.

 Oh, hey, guys.
 Hi, Penny.


Take a break, guys.

 What are you doing?
 Just moving something upstairs.

 What is it?
 Just, you know, a time machine.

Okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

 Just give us a few minutes.
 I'm running really late.

Then I have a simple solution.

Go up to the roof, hop over
to the next building... There's a gap.

Don't look down if you're subject
to vertigo... and use their stairwell.

 You're joking, right?
 Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

Damn. Okay, I'll just take the roof.

If you wait for us
to set up the time machine...

I can drop you off at work yesterday.

Time-travel joke. It's not... Never mind.

For what it's worth,
I thought it was humorous.


Let's just do this.

 You guys ready to push?

Howard stepped outside to throw up.

I don't know what you were worried about.
I think it really works in the room.

Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing
I have ever owned.

The exact time machine
that carried actor Rod Taylor...

from Victorian England
into the post-apocalyptic future...

where society had splintered
into two factions:

the subterranean Morlocks...

who survived by feasting on the flesh
of the gentle surface-dwelling Eloi.

Talk about your chick magnets.

Oh, yeah. The guy who lives next to me
is always like:

"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony.
I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony."

But wait until I tell him
I've got a time machine on my balcony.

Stuff that in your Speedos, Jacuzzi Bob.

Gentlemen, we said we'd take turns...

but I think you'll agree
that practicality dictates it remain here.

You can't keep it.
What if I meet a girl and say:

"You wanna see my time machine?
It's at my friend's house."

How lame is that?

 He's got a point.

We're going to need some ground rules.
"No shoes in the time machine."

"No eating in the time machine."
I propose that we add:

"Pants must be worn at all times
in the time machine."

Seconded.

I was gonna put down a towel.

I still want it on my balcony.
I say we move it on a bimonthly basis.

 That sounds fair.
 Hold on. Bimonthly is an ambiguous term.

 Every other month or twice a month?
 Twice a month.

 Then no.
 Okay, every other month.

No.

Sheldon, you can't be selfish.

We all paid for it,
so it belongs to all of us.

Now get out of the way
so I can sit in my time machine.


Okay. I am setting the dials
for March 10th, 1876.

Good choice. Alexander Graham Bell
invents the telephone and calls for Watson.

 Wait a minute. I wanna see that too.
 So when it's your turn, you can.

If we all go back to the same time,
Bell's lab's going to get very crowded.

He'll know something's up.

Since the time machine
doesn't move in space...

 ...you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.
 Even if you make it to Boston...

what are you gonna do? Knock and say
to Mrs. Bell, "Fan of your husband.

Can I come in and watch him
invent the telephone?"

Mrs. Bell was deaf.
She's not even gonna hear you knock.

I have a solution.
First, go into the future...

 ...and obtain a cloaking device.
 Ooh. How far into the future?

If I remember, Kirk will steal
a cloaking device from the Romulans...

on stardate 5027.3...

which would be January 10th, 2328,
by pre-Federation reckoning.

Okay, I am setting the dials
for January 10th, 2328.

Here we go into the future.

That was fun.


My turn.

Okay, first of all, what you call a gap
was nearly three feet wide.

 I slipped and skinned my knee.
 Are you okay?


The door to the stairwell
of the other building was locked.

I had to go down the fire escape,
which ends on the third floor...

forcing me to crawl through the window
of a lovely Armenian family...

who insisted I stay for lunch.

That doesn't sound too bad.

It was eight courses of lamb.
And they tried to fix me up with their son.

 Sorry.
 Not done.

By the time I got to work,
they'd given my shift away.

Yeah, that's right.
I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this.

 This...
 Time machine.

The lights flash and the dish spins.
Wanna try?

No.

I don't wanna try it.
My God, you are grown men.

How can you waste your lives
with these stupid toys...

and costumes and comic books,
and now that?

 That...
 Again, time machine.

Oh, please, it's not a time machine.
If anything, it looks like...

something Elton John would drive
through the Everglades.

It only moves in time.

It would be worse than useless
in a swamp.

Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic.

My turn.

Leonard, it's 2 in the morning.

 So?
 So it's my turn.

Why'd you set it
for the day before yesterday?

Because I wanna go back and keep myself
from getting a time machine.

You can't. If you were to prevent yourself
from buying it in the past...

you would not have it available
to stop yourself from buying it.

Ergo, you would still have it.
This is a classic rookie time-travel mistake.

Can I go back and prevent you
from explaining that to me?

Same paradox.

If you were to travel back in time
and knock me unconscious...

you wouldn't have the conversation
that irritated you...

motivating you to go back
and knock me unconscious.

What if I knocked you unconscious
right now?

It won't change the past.

But it'd make the present so much nicer.

Are you upset about something?

What was your first clue?

Well, it was a number of things.
First, the late hour.

Then your demeanor
seems very low-energy.

 Plus your irritability...
 Yes, I'm upset.

Oh.

I don't usually pick up on those things.

Good for me.

Yeah, good for you.

Oh, wait.

Did you wanna talk about
what's bothering you?

 I don't know. Maybe.
 Wow, I'm on fire tonight.

Well, here's the thing.

Girls like Penny never end up with guys
who own time machines.

I disagree.

Your inability
to successfully woo Penny...

long predates your acquisition
of the time machine.

That failure clearly stands on its own.

 Thanks for pointing it out.
 In addition, your premise is flawed.

In the original film,
Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux...

with that time machine.

In Back to the Future,
Marty McFly got to hook up...

with his extremely attractive
young mother.

 Those are movies.
 Of course they're movies.

Are you expecting an example
involving a real-life time machine?

That's absurd.

Come on, guys, push.

I'm gonna give birth to my colon.

 Oh, hey, guys.
 Hi, Penny.


Take a break, guys.

What are you doing?

Oh, you know,
just moving a time machine.

Yeah, okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

No problem.

Hang on.

But what about your time machine?

Some things are more important
than toys.

I'm scared.

Don't worry, baby, I've got you.

Oh, Leonard.

It's still my turn.

What are you doing?

I'm packing up all my collectibles...

and taking them down
to the comic-book store to sell.

Is that really necessary?

If you need money,
you can always sell blood.

And semen.

It's not about money.

We brought food.

Lox and bagels,
the breakfast of time travelers.

Terrific. Anyone wanna buy
my share of the time machine?

 Why?
 Because I don't want it anymore.

 Why?
 Just personal reasons.

My Spidey sense tells me
this has something to do with Penny.

Look, do you wanna buy me out or not?

I'll give you $100, which will make me
half-owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.

Screw his balcony.
I'll give you 120 and put it in my garage.

 I paid $200 for my share.
 Everybody knows a time machine loses...

half its value the minute
you drive it off the lot.

I'll go for 200.
That time machine stays right where it is.

Three hundred. And I'll throw in my original
1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon...

with real light-speed sound effects.

No. No more toys or action figures
or props or replicas...

or costumes or robots
or Darth Vader voice changers.

I'm getting rid of all of it.

You can't do that.
Look what you've created.

It's like Nerdvana.

More importantly,
you have a Darth Vader voice changer?

 Not for long.
 I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.

I need that to complete
my Justice Society of America collection.

 I called dibs.
 You can't.

I can and I did.
Look up "dibs" in Wikipedia.

Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.

It's not a bidding war. I'm selling it all
to Larry down at the comic-book store.

 Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
 Will you forget dibs?

He offered me a fair price
for the whole collection.

 What's the number? I'll match it.
 I'll match it, plus 1000 rupees.

 What's the exchange rate?
 None of your business. Take it or leave it.

Mom, my bar mitzvah bonds,
how much do I got?

Thanks. I can go $2600
and two trees in Israel.

Forget it. Guys, if I sell to one of you,
the other two are gonna be mad at me.

Who cares? As long as you pick me.

Okay, Leonard, put down the box.
Let's talk.

Sorry, Raj, my mind is made up.

No. I can't let you do this.

Sheldon, get out of my way.

None shall pass.

Okay.

I did not wanna do this...

but I have here the rare,
mint-condition, production-era...

Star Trek: The Next Generation
Geordi La Forge without his VISOR...

in the original packaging.

If you do not get out of my way...

I will open it.

Okay, man, be cool.

We're all friends here.

What the hell's going on?

 You hypocrite.
 What?

Little Miss Grown-Ups-
Don't-Play-With-Toys.

If I went into that apartment right now,
would I not find Beanie Babies?

Are you not an accumulator
of Care Bears and My Little Ponies?

And who is that Japanese feline
I see frolicking on your shorts?

Hello, Hello Kitty.

Okay, okay, look,
if this is about yesterday, Leonard...

I am really sorry about what I said.
I was just upset.

 No, I needed to hear it.
 You didn't. You are a great guy.

And it is the things you love
that make you who you are.

I guess that makes me large breasts.

Still, I think it's time for me
to get rid of this stuff...

and, you know, move on with my life.

 Really?
 Yeah.

Oh. Wow.

Good for you.

Thanks.

Hey, do you wanna,
I don't know, later...?

Excuse me.

 Hey, Penny.
 Hi, Mike.

 You ready to go?
 I just have to change.

 I'll give you a hand.
 Oh, stop it.

Bye, guys.


My turn on the time machine.

It worked.

It really worked.

They said I was mad, but it worked.

Oh, no, not Morlocks.

Not flesh-eating Morlocks.

Help!


Sheldon, are you okay?

We have to get rid of the time machine.

It is a little big for the living room,
isn't it?

Yeah, that's the problem. It's too big.

I'm glad you agree.
I hired some guys to help us move it.

Come on in, fellas.

Oh, no, Morlocks.

Eat him, eat him.



Leonard!



No, seriously,
I think

I've finally figured out
my problem with women.

The capybara is the largest
member of the rodent family.

What does that have to do
with me and women?

Nothing.
It was a desperate attempt

to introduce an alternate topic
of conversation.

My problem is,
I don't project confidence.

So I decided that
the next time I meet a woman

I think is attractive,
rather than holding back

and being cautious,
I'm going to assume

the mantle of self-assurance.

Oh, yeah?
What's that look like?

Hi.

I'm Leonard.

And you are beautiful.

You pop, sparkle
and buzz electric.

I'm going to pick you up
at 8:00,

show you a night
you will never forget.

Where are we going?

Good news.

I made it
onto the team

for the new Defense Department

laser-equipped
surveillance satellite.

Excuse me.

If we're changing topics,
I believe I have first dibs

with capybara, a rodent
the size of a baby hippo.

Congratulations,
Howard.

Thanks.

Listen, I have to get
a security clearance,

so you guys might be
hearing from the FBI.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

I don't want to speak
to the FBI.

Why not?

I'm brown and I talk funny.

They're just doing
a background check on me.

It doesn't matter;
they'll find a reason

to give me a one-way ticket
back to Gandhi-ville.

By the way,

when I say that,
it's not offensive.

Don't be ridiculous, Raj.

You're here legally.

Nobody cares.
Do you know how long it's been

since I got through
airport security

without being given
a colonoscopy?

You know, I
try very hard

to make our lunch hours
educational and informative,

but your insistence on
talking about your own lives

stymies me at
every turn.

Fine, Sheldon, tell us
about your giant rodents.

1No, you squandered
your time with me,

and the moment
has now passed.

Feast on your disappointment,

much as the capybara
feasts on its own waste.

 


Oh, Bella, don't you see?

Edward's only pushing you away
because he loves you.

Coming.

Dr. Koothrappali?

I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

May I come in?

I'd like to talk to you
about Howard Wolowitz.

Oh, thank you.

All right.

Well, how long
have you known Mr. Wolowitz?

Rum cake?

No, thanks.

Now, about Mr.
Wolowitz...

Seven years.

I see.

I'm in this country
legally, you know.

I'm sure you are.

Now, to your knowledge, has Mr.
Wolowitz ever committed a crime?

Of course not.

I'm here on an H-1B visa,

which means I can't be
associated in any way

with crime
or criminal activity.

And I'm not.

Good.

To your knowledge,
does Mr. Wolowitz

have any foreign
contacts?

No, just me.

Oh, there it is.

Here comes a cavity search.

Excuse me?

Please don't send me back
to India; it's so crowded!

It's like the whole country
is one endless Comic-Con,

except everybody's wearing
the same costume: Indian Guy.

Dr. Koothrappali, I'm not...
I love this country!

The-the baseball,
the freedom,

the rampant morbid obesity!

From California
to the New York Island!

I'm a real Yankee Doodle boy!

Dr. Koothrappali,
please.

 My country 'tis of thee... 

liberty 

 It's really great. 

So, when Howard said the FBI
would be contacting me,

I was expecting Mulder.

Glad to see I got Scully.

Who?

Mulder and Scully.

X-Files.

"The truth is out there."

Never mind.

Uh, so, what would you
like to know?

You work with Mr. Wolowitz here
at the university, correct?

Yes. Of course, we're in
different departments.

He's an engineer and I'm
an experimental physicist.

You know, one
of those guys

who examines the building blocks
of creation

and says,
"Hello, maker of the universe.

"I see what you did there.

Good one."

Right.

Now, how would you characterize

your relationship
with Mr. Wolowitz?

Good.

It's a good
relationship.

Of course, most of my
relationships are good.

Probably because
I exude confidence.

People are drawn to that,
you know?

Confidence, not exuding.

Do you know of any groups
Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?

You are beautiful,

you know that?

You pop, sparkle
and buzz electric.

I'm going to pick you up
at 8:00,

show you a night
you will never forget.

Sounds great.

Really?

Yeah.

Can my six-foot-two Navy SEAL
husband come with us?

Is that...?

Oh, my, I didn't see the ring
with my glasses off, so...

Look at that,
I'm starting to exude.

Want to get that?

Not particularly.

Could you get that?

I suppose I could
if I were asked.

Would you please get that?

Of course.

Why do you have to make things
so complicated?

Dr. Cooper?

Yes.

I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

You say you're Special
Agent Page, FBI.

Here's my I.D.

And here is

my Justice League
membership card.

But that doesn't
prove I know Batman.

I just want to ask you a few
questions about Howard Wolowitz.

Oh. All right.

I doubt anyone
would risk

the stiff penalties for
impersonating a federal officer

just to ask questions about
a minor league engineer

with an unresolved
Oedipal complex.

Thank you.

For the record,
I truly support the FBI

in the mission
which is expressed

through their motto...?

Fidelity, bravery, integrity.

Correct. Now to business.

18 years ago, I sent
the FBI Crime Lab samples

from a bag of excrement
that had been lit on fire

on my front porch...

for fingerprinting
and DNA analysis.

Why haven't I heard back yet?

Well, the FBI Crime Lab
does have a lot on its plate.

That's of little comfort
to a nation

attempting to scrape
burning feces off its shoes.

Would you mind if we talked
about Mr. Wolowitz now?

A little, but go on.

Thank you.

Would you characterize him
as responsible?

I'm going to answer that
with a visual aid.

This is my nine-disc complete

Lord of the Rings trilogy
Blu-ray set.

Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it,

damaged plastic retention
hub number three...

and then returned it to me,
hoping I wouldn't notice.

Would you characterize that
as responsible?

That's really not the sort of
thing we're interested in.

You heard me say
Blu-ray, right?

I did.

Very well.

Would you be interested

in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz
once snuck onto

my World of Warcraft account
and changed the name

of a certain level-80 warlock
from Sheldor to Smeldor?

I'm afraid not.

Is there anything else?

"Is there anything else?"

Where would you like to start?

He refuses to pay fines

when he's overdue
with books I lend him.

He crashed the Mars Rover while
attempting to impress a woman.

He recommended that I go see

the third Matrix movie
because it was, and I quote,

"just as good
as the first one."

If that's not irresponsible,
I don't know what is.

The Mars Rover?

Did I say Mars Rover?

You did.

That was actually
a poorly chosen example,

as it had nothing
to do with me.

Yes, well, let's talk
about it anyway.

I don't want to.

Not that my disinclination

to discuss the topic
should be interpreted as

evidence of Howard Wolowitz's
culpability in the destruction

of government property
worth millions of dollars.

Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

I think I have all I need.

Oh, good.

I was afraid you were
going to fixate

on that Mars Rover incident.

Hey, buddies.

Guess who didn't get
security clearance

to work on
the giant space laser?

What happened?

Apparently, the background
interviews didn't go well.

You guys wouldn't
know anything

about that, would you?

Well, actually,
I may have gotten

a little tipsy
when I talked to her.

And I may have

hit on her a little bit.

I may have thrown up
rum cake on her shoes.

I see.

Well, it's good to know, when
I need you guys, I can always

count on you to step up
and ruin everything.

I feel awful.

Ah, me, too.

To tell you the truth,

I thought if anyone was going to

screw things up for Howard,
it'd be Sheldon.

Well, your expectations
have been subverted.

Aha.

What are you doing up?

Sleep eludes me, Leonard.

Really?

Maybe sleep has met you before.

Mockery?

That's all you have to offer?

I'm sorry. Why can't you sleep?

Who knows?

I haven't watched
any scary movies recently.

I'm no longer obsessing
over why the predicted mass

of the quantum vacuum
has little effect

on the expansion
of the universe.

And it's been weeks since I took
that accidental sip of Red Bull.

Did something happen today
that's bothering you?

Well, I did mention

the Mars Rover incident
to that FBI agent

and probably cost Howard
his security clearance.

What?
But why should that keep me up?

Because you feel guilty?

Interesting.

So you're saying my insomnia is
caused by a guilty conscience.

Actually,
you don't have insomnia.

You're sleeping now.

Excuse me?

You're having
a guilt-ridden dream.

Do you have any evidence
to support that hypothesis?

How about that Gorn
sitting on the couch?

That seems fairly conclusive.

No, Gorn, no.

That's where I sit.

Thank you for agreeing
to see me, Agent Page.

Thank you for filing a complaint
with my superior, Dr. Cooper.

I understand
you want to recant

your statement
about Howard Wolowitz.

Yes.
Was your statement untrue?

No.

Then I'm afraid
you can't withdraw it.

I'm sorry. I don't recall
you saying "no backsies."

Is there anything else?

Yes. I'd like to offer
a laudatory statement

about Howard's many excellent
qualities that I believe

will tip the scales
back in his favor.

"Howard Joel Wolowitz.

"H is for honesty,
of which he has much.

"O's for outstanding,

"which he is such.

"W's for witty,
he's quick with a joke.

A's for artistic, his ability...
" I'm sorry.

Dr. Cooper, this matter
is already closed.

But I still have
"rd Joel Wolowitz" left to go.

It's closed.

I don't understand
why you people

are picking on my
friend, Howard,

when there are much more serious
security threats to pursue.

For instance,
when I first met Leonard,

he was on the verge
of giving away

rocket secrets
to a North Korean spy,

and not one agent
ever investigated that.

This is Leonard Hofstadter?

No, it's a different Leonard.

He's...

Chinese, red hair, six fingers.

Good-bye.

Raj.

Have you seen Howard?

I think he's eating lunch.

Uh, Sheldon, I want you
to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson

from the Hayden Planetarium
in New York.

I'm quite familiar
with Dr. Tyson.

He's responsible
for the demotion of Pluto

from planetary status.

I liked Pluto.

Ergo I do not like you.

But I actually
didn't demote Pluto.

That was a vote

of the International
Astronomical Union.

If "ifs" and "buts"
were candy and nuts,

we'd all have a merry Christmas.

Think about that, Dr. Tyson.

Is that the guy you
were telling me about?

Oh, yeah.

Howard.

The person at fault for you

not getting
a security clearance is me.

You?

Yes, but before you get upset,
I want you to know

I went to the FBI
and retracted my statement.

And they were okay with that?

No. If anything,
I made it worse.

In any case, I have
been riddled with guilt,

which is causing
Gorn-infested REM sleep.

So, I'm here now
to say I'm sorry.

Are you kidding me?

You've set my career back
at least two years,

and you think you can make it
right with "I'm sorry"?

Yes.

I followed the social protocol.

I attempted to right the wrong,
and when I failed to do so,

I delivered a heartfelt apology.

Now you say,

"Apology accepted,"

and I will offer you
a one-time-only high five.

Your apology is not accepted.

You're tricking me.

It really is, isn't it?

Leave me alone, Sheldon.

Dr. Cooper, I just
wanted you to know

I'm sorry for the role I
played in the Pluto matter.

Oh, shut up.

Sheldon?

Hello.

What are you doing here?

I have troubles, Penny.

I've come to pour them out

to the sympathetic ear
of the local barkeep.

You know, they have
a really nice bar

over at the Olive Garden.

I don't like the Olive Garden.

They treat me like family.

Okay, Sheldon.
What can I get you?

Alcohol.

Could you be
a little more specific?

Ethyl alcohol.

40 milliliters.

I'm sorry, honey.
I don't know milliliters.

Ah. Blame President James
"Jimmy" Carter.

He started America on a path
to the metric system

but then just gave up.

He wonders why he
was a one-term president.

Would you say that's
about 40 milliliters?

More or less.
Great.

Now, where were we?

I believe you were about
to ask me to choose a cocktail.

Fortunately, thanks
to computer-savvy alcoholics,

there's an app for that.

Let's see.

Harvey Wallbanger. Eh.

Sex on the Beach.
I hardly think so.

Rob Roy,

Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter.

Ooh!

I'll have a Rosewater Ricky.

A what?
You'll need pitted,

brandied cherries, gin,
rosewater,

Angostura bitters
and overproofed rum.

Now, first, dust
the cherries with sugar,

then spray them with a mixture
of rum and bitters.

Then ignite the rum,
caramel...

Here you go-- one
Rosewater Ricky.

That's not how it looks
in the picture.

Oh, yeah, you know, every
bartender makes it differently.

Why don't you
give it a try.

All right.

To the metric system.

I can't taste the cherries.

All right.
Sheldon, what's on your mind?

I wronged Howard,
and he won't accept my apology.

Oh, right, that.

Yes, Leonard told me.
Sorry, honey.

Penny, you face failure
on a daily basis.

How do you cope?

I drink.

To drinking.

Nope.

Oh, if only there were some way

to force Howard
to accept my apology

so I could escape
this miasma of guilt.

You know, sometimes
stuff just happens,

and there's nothing
you can do about it.

For example, Lisa Peterson

hasn't talked to me
since the 11th grade,

because no matter how
much you apologize,

you can't go back and
un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.

I see.

You're saying I'm facing
Starfleet Academy's

unwinnable command scenario:
the Kobayashi Maru.

Exactly.

Sometimes you can't win.

Captain Kirk won.

Kirk cheated.

Impressive that you know that.

It's hard to believe

I'm actually having
this conversation with you.

Right there with you.

Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru
by reprogramming the simulator.

That's it.
What?

I'll reprogram Howard.
What...?

Sheldon, you can't
reprogram people.

No, you can't reprogram people.

To James Tiberius Kirk.

Hello, all.

 Hello.
 Hey.

Howard, you're feeling better
about me today, aren't you?

Not really.

Yes, you are.

I'm using
neurolinguistic programming

to modify your thought patterns.

Oh.

Go away, Sheldon.

There's a $9.95 e-book
down the drain.

What's in the bag?

It's for Howard.

Oh. Sheldon, you can't
fix this with gifts.

Nevertheless, I've hurt you,

and whether you
forgive me or not,

I want you to
have this.

You're giving me
a couch cushion?

No.

The cushion is merely symbolic.

I'm giving you my spot
on the couch.

But you love that spot.

No. I love my mother.

My feelings for my spot
are much greater.

It is the singular location
in space

around which revolves
my entire universe.

And now it's yours.

Oh, my God, dude.
Now you have to forgive him.

All right.

Apology accepted.

High five.

Not too hard.

Thank you.

I haven't cried like this
since Toy Story 3.

I got to tell you,

Sheldon, I understand why
you chose this spot.

I mean, the temperature is
good, but there's no draft.

I can see the television,
but I can still talk to...

I changed my mind.
Get out of my spot.

How long?

94 seconds.



Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

I'm going to the Arctic Circle with
Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.

 For three months?
 Yes.

What did you mean when you said
you were going to miss me?

It means I wish you weren't going,

Oh, thank God we're home.

I can't believe we spent three months
in that frozen hell,

It was like a snowy nightmare
from which there was no awakening.

I don't know what Arctic expedition
you were on...

I thought it was a hoot and a half.

Oh, hi, Mom.

No. I told you I'd call you when I got home.
I'm not home yet.

All right. I'm home.

The Arctic expedition
was a remarkable success.

I'm all but certain there's a Nobel Prize
in my future.

Actually, I shouldn't say that.
I'm entirely certain.

No, Mother, I could not feel
your church group praying for my safety.

The fact that I'm home safe
doesn't prove it worked.

That logic is post hoc
ergo propter hoc.

No, I'm not sassing you
in Eskimo talk.

 I'm gonna let Penny know we're back.
 Mother, I have to go.

Yeah, love you. Bye.

Hello, old friend.

Daddy's home.

Leonard, you're back.

Yeah, I just stopped by to say...

 Yeah, so hi.
 Hi.

Damn it, I should've gone over
and told her we were back.

Yeah, it was first come, first serve.

I just want you both to know,
when I publish my findings...

 ...I won't forget your contributions.
 Great.

I can't mention you
in my Nobel acceptance speech.

When I write my memoirs...

you can expect a very effusive footnote
and perhaps a signed copy.

 We have to tell him.
 Tell me what?

Damn his Vulcan hearing.

You are planning a party for me,
aren't you?

Okay, Sheldon, sit down.

If there's going to be a theme,
I should let you know...

I don't care for luau, toga
or under the sea.

Yeah. We'll keep that in mind.
Look, we need to talk to you...

about something that happened
at the North Pole.

If this is about the night
the heat went out...

there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

 It's not about that.
 We agreed to never speak of it again.

So we slept together naked.

It was only to keep our core
body temperatures from plummeting.

 He's speaking about it.
 For me it was a bonding moment.

Sheldon, you remember
the first few weeks...

we were looking for magnetic monopoles
and not finding anything...

and you were acting
like an obnoxious giant dictator?

I thought we were gonna be gentle
with him.

That's why I added the "tator."

And when we finally got
our first positive data...

you were so happy.

Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons,
I was colon, capital D.

Well, ahem, in actuality,
what your equipment detected...

wasn't so much evidence
of paradigm-shifting monopoles...

as it was static from the electric
can opener we were turning on and off.

He just went colon, capital O.

 You tampered with my experiment?
 We had to.

It was the only way to keep you
from being such a huge Dickensian.

You see that? I added the "ensian."

Did Leonard know about this?

Leonard's my best friend.
Surely Leonard didn't know.

 It was his idea.
 Of course it was.

The whole plan reeks of Leonard.

 I missed you so much.
 I missed you too.

 I couldn't think of anyone else.
 Me neither.

Except for one night
when the heat went out.

Long story. It's... Don't ask.

Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.

Do not make a sound.

Whispering, "Do not make a sound"...

is a sound.

Damn his Vulcan hearing.

Not a good time, Sheldon.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

Ugh, this is ridiculous.

 What?
 Hello, Penny.

I realize you're currently at the mercy
of your biological urges...

but as you have a lifetime of poor
decisions ahead, may I interrupt this one?

Great to see you too. Come on in.

Wolowitz has informed me
of your grand deception.

Do you have anything to say?

Yes, I feel terrible about it.
I will never forgive myself.

I don't expect you to. I'd appreciate it
if you'd leave me with Penny...

for a session of self-criticism
and repentance.

Can someone tell me
what's going on here?

What's going on is I was led to believe
I was making strides in science...

when in fact
I was being fed false data...

at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali
and your furry little boy toy.

Is that true?

 It was the only way to make him happy.
 Why'd you have to make him happy?

Because when he wasn't happy
we wanted to kill him.

That was even a plan.

We were going to throw
his Kindle outside.

And when he went to get it, lock
the door and let him freeze to death.

 That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
 No.

The overreaction was to tie your limbs
to four different sled-dog teams...

and yell, "Mush!"

Look, we kept the original data.
You can still publish the actual results.

Yes,, but the actual results
are unsuccessful.

I sent an e-mail
to everyone at the university...

explaining I confirmed
string theory...

and forever changed
man's understanding of the universe.

Oh. See, yeah, you probably
shouldn't have done that.

So write another e-mail.
Set the record straight. It's no big deal.

You're right, Leonard.
That's not a big deal.

All you did was lie to me,
destroy my dream...

and humiliate me
in front of the whole university.

That, FYI, was sarcasm.

I, in fact, believe it is a big deal.

 Oh. That poor thing.
 Yeah, I feel terrible.

Wait.
Aren't you gonna go talk to him?

Well, I... He'll be fine.
The guy's a trouper. Come here.

No, no, you're right.
You shouldn't talk to him. I will.

Man, I cannot catch a break.

 Hey. Do you wanna talk?
 About what?

Being betrayed by my friends?

Spending three months at the North Pole
for nothing?

And I didn't even get to go
to Comic-Con.

Oh, hon...

Soft kitty, warm kitty

That's for when I'm sick.
Sad is not sick.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know your sad song.

I don't have a sad song.
I'm not a child.

Well, you know, I do understand
what you're going through.

Really? Did you have
the Nobel Prize in waitressing...

stolen from you?

Well, no.

But, uh, when I was in high school,
one of my friends heard...

I was gonna be named
head cheerleader. I was so excited.

My mom even made me
a celebration pie.

Then they named stupid
Valerie Mosbacher head cheerleader.

Big old slutbag.

Are you saying
that you think a celebration pie...

is even remotely comparable
to a Nobel Prize?

Well, they're pretty tasty.

And on a different
but not unrelated topic...

based on your current efforts
to buoy my spirits...

do you truly believe that you
were ever fit to be a cheer leader?

Look, I just don't think
that the guys and Leonard...

really meant to hurt you.
They just told an unfortunate lie...

to deal with a difficult situation.
You know what it's like?

Remember the new Star Trek movie?
Kirk has to take over the ship...

so he tells Spock stuff
he knew wasn't true.

Like saying Spock didn't care
his mom died.

I missed Comic-Con
and the new Star Trek movie?

 I like the new look.
 Thanks.

I call it the Clooney.

I call it the Mario and Luigi,
but whatever.

Hey, how's Sheldon doing?

He came out of his room
wearing his Darth Vader helmet...

and tried to choke me to death
with the Force, so I'd say a little better.

If I may abruptly change the subject,
did you and Penny finally...? You know.

 Howard.
 I don't care...

but my genitals wanted me to ask.

Tell your genitals what I do with Penny
is none of their business.

He says they didn't do it.

Sheldon, over here.

What are you doing?

Well, I feel bad for the guy.

Sheldon, why are you sitting
by yourself?

Because I am without friends.

Like the proverbial cheese,
I stand alone.

Even while seated.

Come on. We said we were sorry.

It's going to take more
than an "I'm sorry"...

and an apology pie from Penny
to make up for what you've done to me.

Hey, Cooper.
Read your retraction e-mail.

Way to destroy your reputation.

You see? People have been pointing
and laughing at me all morning.

It's not true.

People have been pointing and laughing
at you your whole life.

All right, I've had enough.
Attention, everyone.

I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

As many of you
in the Physics Department know...

my career trajectory
has taken a minor detour.

Off a cliff.

 My credibility may have been damaged.
 Completely wrecked.

But I would like to remind you that in
science there's no such thing as failure.

There once was a man...

who referred to his prediction
of a cosmological constant...

as the single biggest blunder
of his career.

That man's name was, surprise, surprise,
Albert Einstein.

Yeah, but research into dark energy
proved...

Einstein's cosmological constant
was actually right all along.

So you're still, surprise, surprise,
a loser.

Oh, you think you're so clever.

Well, let me just tell you.
While I do not currently have a retort...

check your e-mail periodically
for a doozy.

So much for our friendship with Sheldon.

Well, we'll always have the night
the heat went out.

 Hi.
 Hey.

Since we got interrupted last night,
I didn't have a chance to give you this.

Aw, Leonard. You shouldn't have.

Oh, boy. Ha, ha.

What is it?

It's a snowflake from the North Pole.

 Are you serious?
 Uh-huh.

It'll last forever. I preserved it in a
1-percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.

God, that's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever said to me...

that I didn't understand.

It's actually a pretty simple process.

You see, cyanoacrylates are monomers,
which polymerize...

Red alert. Leonard, Sheldon ran away.

Man, I cannot catch a break.

So how do you know he ran away?

I mean, he's not answering his phone,
he handed in his resignation...

and he sent me a text that said,
"I'm running away."

Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

Well... Leonard.
Aren't you gonna do something?

Well, of course
I'm gonna do something.

Uh, Howard, check the comic-book store.

Raj, go to the Thai restaurant.
I'll stay with Penny in her apartment.

Oh, damn it.

It's Sheldon's mother.

A break cannot be caught.

Hi, Mrs. Cooper.

He is?

Sheldon went home to Texas.

Yeah... No, I know he resigned.

Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault.

No, no. You're right.
Someone needs to come talk to him.

Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Yeah.
All right.

New plan.

Howard, you and Raj go to Texas,
I'll stay with Penny in her apartment.

 You're not gonna go with them?
 Well, you know...

I gave you the snowflake,
and we were kissing, and...

Come on. I don't wanna go to Texas.

Oh, right. And I do? My people already
crossed the desert once. We're done.

Trust me, you'll be fine. See you.

Well, wait a second, Leonard.
Come on. How can you not go?

 He's your best friend.
 But I already saw him naked.

 Just come here.
 No.

I promise I will be here
when you get back.

Just go help Sheldon.

 Really?
 Yeah.

We waited a few months.
We can wait a few more days.

Maybe you can.

Go.

Boy, you cannot catch a break,
can you?

 Here you go, Shelly.
 Thanks, Mom.

Yeah.

Hold your horses, young man.
Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.

Oh, Mom.

This is not California,
land of the heathen.

Give me.

By his hand we are all...

Fed.

 Give us, Lord, our daily...
 Bread.

 Please know that we are truly...
 Grateful.

 For every cup and every...
 Plateful.

Amen.

Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

My objection was based
on considerations other than difficulty.

Whatever. Jesus still loves you.

Thank you for carving a smiley face
in my sandwich.

I know how to take care of my baby.

His eyes came out a little thin,
but you can just pretend he's Chinese.

So do you want to talk
about what happened...

with you and your little friends?

 They're not my friends.
 All right.

If you recall, when you were little
we sat right here at this very spot...

and talked about the problems you had
getting along with the neighbor kids.

That was different. They were
threatened by my intelligence...

and too stupid to know
that's why they hated me.

Oh, baby, they knew very well
why they hated you.

I can't believe
you bought a red cowboy hat.

Hello? I'm wearing a red turtleneck.

Plus it was the only boys' large
they had.

I'm sorry. This does not look like Texas.
Where's the tumbleweeds?

 Where's the saloons?
 Saloons?

Like in the movies I saw growing up.

You know, uh, 4 for Texas,
Yellow Rose of Texas.

This neighborhood
is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.

What can I tell you?

They probably have steaks on sale
at that big-ass Costco over there.

Will you please take that stupid hat off?

No, I wanna blend in.

To what? Toy Story?

Hi, boys.

 Howdy, ma'am.
 Howdy to you too. You got here quick.

 We took the redeye.
 Come on in.

Thank you kindly.

 Can I get you something to drink?
 No, thank you.

If y'all don't mind,
I got a hankering for a Lone Star Beer.

There's no alcohol in this household,
stop talking like that and lose the hat.

Sorry. I'll take a diet Yoo-hoo
if you have it.

You'll take a cola.

What about you? Raj, is it?

Oh, you still having trouble talking
to the ladies? Ha-ha-ha.

Because, you know, at our church...

we have a woman
who's an amazing healer.

Mostly she does crutch
and wheelchair people...

but I bet she'd be willing
to take a shot...

at whatever Third-World demon
is running around inside of you.

If you don't mind, there's a 3:05
nonstop back to Los Angeles...

and you have no idea
how much I wanna be on it.

 A girl?
 Uh, yes, ma'am.

Oh, good. I've been praying for you.

Oh, Sheldon.

What are they doing here?

 We came to apologize.
 Again.

And bring you home.
Pack up your stuff and we'll head back.

No. This is my home now.

Thanks to you, my career is over.
I will spend the rest of my life here...

trying to teach evolution
to creationists.

You watch your mouth, Shelly.

Everyone's entitled to their opinion.

Evolution isn't an opinion, it's fact.

And that is your opinion.

I forgive you, let's go home.

Don't tell me prayer doesn't work.

How about that?
Finally caught a break.

Uh-huh.

You know how they say
when friends have sex it can get weird?

Sure.

 Why does it have to get weird?
 Pbbt. I don't know.

I mean, we were friends
and now we're more than friends.

And we're whatever this is.
But why label it, right? I mean...

It is what it is and...

 Leonard?
 Yeah?

 It's weird.
 Totally.



is a moss-covered door.

You manage to open it
only to find yourself face-to-face...

with a hideous,
foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre.

What do you do?

I say, "Hey, Ma, what's for dinner?"

Seventeen.

The ogre is amused by your joke
and allows you to pass.

By the by, I liked it too.

How go the wedding plans, Howard?

Great. Spent five hours last night
at Macy's registering for gifts.

I'm finally gonna have that earthenware
asparagus dish I've always wanted, heh.

See, this is the good thing about
having a girlfriend 9000 miles away.

I can spend my nights
doing whatever I want.

Like playing nerd games with us...

and then taking
a suspiciously long shower?

Maybe.

We enter the dungeon.

You see a dragon.

Really?
So we're playing Dungeons and Dragons.

And we walk into a dungeon
and see a dragon?

 Isn't that a little on the nose?
 When you play Chutes and Ladders...

do you complain about all the chutes
and the ladders?

Are you gonna eat that whole pie?

Maybe. Why not?

Who do I have in my life
to watch my figure for?

Oh, God,
did you watch Bridget Jones again?

No, it's just that
everybody's got someone.

Sheldon's with Amy,
Howard's getting married...

 ...you're dating my sister.
 Now that Howard's getting married...

maybe he'll inflate
one of his old girlfriends for you, heh.

You know who I blame
for my loneliness?

The United States of America.

Your movies and your TV shows...

promised streets paved with beautiful
blonde women with big bazongas.

Eat another pie,
you'll have your own bazongas.

That's cruel.
You know it goes straight to my hips.

Gentlemen, please focus.

 You're facing a fire-breathing dragon.
 Unh, I don't know if I wanna play anymore.

Because you don't have a girlfriend?
If that becomes a reason...

not to play Dungeons and Dragons,
this game's in serious trouble.

Now, I assume we use this same wax
later on...

to neaten up
each other's bikini regions.

Yeah, my bikini region is fine.

Who's shocked? I'm not.


So, Bernadette,
how's the wedding planning going?

And I'm not asking
as a prospective bridesmaid.

Pick me. Pick me.

We went cake tasting yesterday.

Raj came along.

He cried and ate half the samples.

Oh, poor guy. He's so lonely.
We should set him up with someone.

You know,
I met a really cute girl at work.

She's married to a guy
in one of our drug trials.

Well, hello? She's married, heh.

Yeah, but her husband
is in serious congestive heart failure...

and a little birdie told me
he's in the placebo group.

Okay, so future grief-stricken widow
is the one to beat.

 You ready to order?
 One moment.

I'm conducting an experiment.

With Dungeons and Dragons dice?

Yes. From here on in...

I've decided to make all trivial
decisions with a throw of the dice.

Thus freeing up my mind
to do what it does best...

enlighten and amaze.

Page 14, item seven.

So, what's for dinner?

A side of corn succotash.

Hmm, interesting.

Um, Howard,
can I see you for a minute, please?

Ugh, I don't wanna show any more of your
friends how I can fit in the booster seats.

Uh, no, that's not it.
Just come with me, please?

Let's see what I'll be washing
that succotash down with.

A pitcher of margaritas.

Do you really want that?

That's the great thing.
It doesn't matter.

My mind is freed up
to think about more important things.

What's it thinking about now?

Hamburgers and lemonade.

Um, Raj, there's someone
I want you to meet.

This is my friend, Emily.
I know her from spin class.

No. Raj, relax.
She can't hear you. She's deaf.

Emily, this is our friend Raj.

 Heh.
 Aw.

Look at you guys, just hitting it off.
I am so good.

Hi.

She says, "it's nice to meet you."

Did she really mean that
or was she signing it sarcastically?

Raj says, "It's nice to meet you too." Heh.

Uh, she says she has to go back
to her family.

But Penny has her number
if you wanna text her and get together.

Okay, I'm gonna play it cool.

Tell her, "Maybe. Whatever, babe."

He'll text you, heh.

Huh. Look at that. I have a date.

I love America again.

And now for dessert.

Come on, hot fudge sundae.
Come on, hot fudge sundae.

Bam! That's what I'm talking about.

Okay. As soon as she gets here,
so she knows I'm cool with it...

I'm going to make a joke
about her being deaf.


I was thinking,
"Hey, did you hear the one about...?

Oh, no, I bet you didn't."

Maybe we should revisit
your lonely, fat guy plan, heh.

Oh, she's here.

No joke.

 She's sorry she's late.
 Oh, tell her it doesn't matter.

Tell her her eyes shimmer
like opalescent lilies...

in the lake of the palace
of the celestial maidens.

Really?
That's the first thing you wanna say?

 I worked on it all night. Use it.
 I don't know the sign for "opalescent."

 Then spell it.
 I don't know how to spell it.

You're blowing this for me.

He likes your eyes, heh.

You're making me sound
like a caveman.

"Thank you, you have nice eyes too."

Really?
Ask her how many children she wants...

and whatever number she says,
say, "Me too."

No.

Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice
like James Earl Jones.

She doesn't know
what James Earl Jones sounds like.

Great. Then she won't know I'm lying.

Let's see, what else can I tell you
about me that would make you like me?

Uh...

Oh, I love music.

Do you love music?

You really wanna ask her that?

Oh. You're right.
Heh, everyone loves music.

She says,
"Do you play an instrument?"

No, but when I was 6 years old...

I tried to start a boy band
called Frankie Goes to Bollywood.

But I couldn't get any other boys
to join...

so my parents asked the servants
to be my backup dancers.

Wait, when you sign servants,
don't sign it like I'm bragging.

Sign it in a way that I sound humble,
with just a hint of:

"That's right, I had servants."

 Do you hear yourself?
 Yes, but she doesn't.

So get signing, hand monkey.

I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus
every day.

And then on Christmas morning...

under the tree is a little puppy
with a red ribbon.


 What are you doing?
 Texting Bernadette I'm gonna be late.

 Dude, what is she saying?
 It's a funny story about a puppy.

Just smile and laugh.


 Quick, stop smiling.
 What? Why?

The puppy died. It choked
on a doll head. Sad face, sad face.

It's a little hard to see
with the city lights...

but that W-shaped constellation
is Cassiopeia.

And she was the mother of Andromeda,
who's over there.

Look, pretty stars.

This is her car, heh.

She hopes she can see you again
sometime.

Good, good. Uh...

Oh, boy, uh, help me out here.
Does she want me to kiss her or not?

I speak sign language,
I don't read minds.

 If you were me, would you kiss her?
 Yeah, but I'm the make-out king.

I was so smooth on that date.


You? I made you smooth.
You were an idiot.

Whatever, dude. She kissed me.

Yeah, well, it might have been
on your lips but it was my kiss.

Fine. Let's agree she kissed
both of us.

Okay.

Mustache is looking good there,
Sheldon.

Don't thank me. Thank the dice.

They told me
what percentage of my face to shave.

Why are you still doing this?

Because it's working.

In the past few weeks,
unburdened by trivial decisions...

I've co-authored two papers
in notable peer-reviewed journals...

and I'm close to figuring out
why the Large Hadron Collider...

has yet to isolate
the Higgs boson particle.

You left out, got chafed testicles
because you no longer wear underpants.

The dice giveth
and the dice taketh away.

 Is Raj out with Emily again?
 Yeah. Every night for the last month.

Wow. I can't believe he has a girlfriend.

Me neither.

Here's some other fun news
on the Raj-Emily front.

He gave her a pair of diamond earrings
and leased her a car.

You're kidding.

 Think she's taking advantage of him?
 Oh, of course not.

She wouldn't do something like that.
She's deaf.

Deaf women can't be gold diggers?

Handicapped people are nice, Leonard.
Everyone knows that.

I actually have information about Raj that
would be helpful with this discussion.

Could you tell us?

Let's see.

Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.

Wait. Hang on. Doubles. Roll again.

Okay, get this.

It doesn't matter
if he's showering her with gifts...

because the Koothrappalis
are vastly wealthy.

 What do you mean "vastly wealthy"?
 Well, "wealthy" means a lot of money.

"Vastly" means even more.
I'm not sure what's tripping you up.

I know they have money.
I don't think it's that much.

No, you're wrong.
As you know, a few years ago...

I achieved one of my lesser dreams
and became a notary public.

Well, from time to time,
I notarize banking documents for Raj.

The Koothrappalis aren't just rich,
they're Richie Rich rich.

Well, so how much is that?

About halfway between Bruce Wayne
and Scrooge McDuck.

The last time we went to the zoo...

that son of a bitch
made me buy him a churro.

I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude
but I need to go call Raj's sister...

who I love so much.

Ahem, so vastly much.

Okay, so he's got money,
and it's a few gifts, and a car.

And she got him
to pay off all her credit cards.

What? He paid off her credit cards?

Damn it, I could have dated Raj
for a couple months.

But I wouldn't have because I'm not that
kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.

He's not gonna listen, he's in love.

Can't figure out what to do?
I remember those days.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to...

stay right here.


 This is a bad idea. We should go.
 No.

I'm the one that introduced him to her.
I've gotta say something.

Wow.

 You're engaged to my friend.
 Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind...

where I get my motor running,
as long as I park in the right garage.

I can't believe you're engaged
to my friend.

Oh, here she comes.

Smart. Whisper,
so the deaf chick can't hear you.

 Oh, hey. Hi. Nice to see you.

Um, can we talk to you about Raj?

She says, "Sure, what about him?"

Okay. Um, gosh, how do I start?

Um, see, Raj is kind of naive.

He hasn't dated
a whole lot of women.

And I'm concerned that,
without meaning to...

you might be taking advantage
of him.

By letting him buy you
a bunch of expensive things.

I... Howard, focus.

 Tell her what I'm saying.
 Right.

Are you a gold digger or not?

Oh, something, something. Who
the something do you think you are?

Mind your own something business
and go something yourself.

Oh, ha, ha, wait, I got this now.

 I'm so mad at you.
 Okay, wait.

How dare you ambush my girlfriend
at the gym?

We didn't mean for it
to be an ambush.

It's kind of impossible not to sneak up
on deaf people.

And, hey,
since when are you so chatty?

 I'm hammered.
 Raj, come here.

This girl is trouble.

What kind of relationship is it where
you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?

The best one I've ever had.

Okay, come on,
you know you can do better.

Aha!

I see what's going on here.

You and I had our crazy night
together.

And now you can't stand to see me
with another woman.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

It's okay,
I can't get mad at your feelings.

I don't have feelings.

Yeah, that's good.
Keep telling yourself that.


He is cuter now that I know he's rich.

I have a surprise for you.
Cover your eyes.

Open them.

It's a real ruby.

It was a little expensive,
but no one can put a price on love.

Although the people at Cartier
took a pretty good shot at it.


Oh, Mummy, Daddy,
what a nice surprise.

No, it's not a nice surprise,
it's a bad surprise.

 Penny called us.
 Penny?

She told us you're spending all our money
on your new girlfriend.

I just got her a couple of things.

She gives me things too.

Yeah, yeah. I'm a gynecologist.
I know exactly what she gives you.

You need to find a nice Indian girl
from a good family.

If you keep seeing this woman,
you're cut off.

What? You're gonna make me choose
between the woman I love...

and the money
I have very strong feelings for?

It's up to you.

 Well, I choose love.
 Heh, you're an idiot.

Love doesn't last.

Well, he's going to find out eventually.

Think about it.

My, uh, parents are making me choose
between money and you.

I choose you.

No. I think we'll have to return
the car.

And the necklace. Yeah, that too.

But none of those things matter
because we have something better.

We have love.

 Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.
 Uh...

I know. I know.

Sometimes I put the TV on mute
just to pretend she's still with me.

But I can't watch the closed-captioning
without crying.


Oh, I'm so sorry.

I wish I can make you feel better.

Seriously?

I'm heartbroken
and you're hitting on me?

What? No.

Look, Penny, you're great,
but I had a long talk with my parents.

And they said if I date an Indian girl,
I get a Maserati.

Mm, oh, cheesecake,
you're just as good as a woman...

even though I can't have sex
with you.

Try throwing it in the microwave
for a few seconds.

Should I use the restroom
or wait until we get home?

Come on,
Papa needs to void his bladder.

Oh, that's not what you wanna see
after three buttermilks.

Here you go, boys.
I'll pick it up when you're ready.

 Thanks for dinner, buddy.
 Yeah, real big of you.

Hurry, hurry, hurry.

Oh, don't cheap out on the tip.
We all know you're loaded now.



Oh, look,  Saturn 3 is on.

I don't want to watch  Saturn 3.

 Deep Space Nine is better.

How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?

Simple subtraction will tell you it's six better.

Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.

In what sense is that a compromise?

Well, five is partway between three... Never mind.

I'll tell you what.

How about we go rock-paper-scissors?

Ooh, I don't think so.

Anecdotal evidence suggests

that in the game of rock-paper-scissors,

players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time

due to the limited number of outcomes.

I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.

What?

It's very simple.

Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock.

Rock crushes lizard.

Lizard poisons Spock.

Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard.

Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock.

Spock vaporizes rock.

And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

Okay, I think I got it.

Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock!

Oh!

Hello, boys.

Ahoy, matey.

Noticed the eye patch, did you?

It's all part of a technique I've been studying

for picking up women.

You employ a visual display (thud)

designed to make yourself

distinctive and memorable.

Oh, yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage

or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.

Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.

Mock me if you will, but it works.

You show up at a club in something distinctive,

scope out your target and toss out some negs.

What are negs?

A neg is a negative compliment

that throws a pretty woman off her game,

like "Normally, I'm not turned on by big teeth,

but on you, they work."

I got a whole list of 'em. Who wants to be my wingman?

You're not gonna need wingman.

You're gonna need a paramedic.

Howard, your scooter's blocking my car.

Aw, did you get pinkeye again?

Step one: she notices the eye patch.

May I say, Penny,

not a lot of women could look as hot as you do

with such greasy hair?

Yeah, just move your stupid scooter

before I pick it up and throw it in the mpster.

Ow.

 

I'm sorry, but I'm not going to watch The Clone Wars TV series

until I've seen  The e Clone Wars movie.

I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me

in the order he intended.

Well, I want to watch it now.

Then I believe we've arrived at another quintessential

rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.

Watch whatever you want.

I saw what you did there.

What'd I do?

(phone rings)

Hello. Hey, Howard.

What's wrong?

Okay. Okay, we'll be right there.

What happened?

Howard's at the Mars Rover lab. He says he's in trouble.

Defcon 5.

Defcon 5?

Well, there's no need to rush.

What?

Defcon 5 means "no danger."

Defcon 1 is a crisis.

How can 5 not be worse than 1?

Yeah, Star Trek V worse than I.

Okay, first of all, that's a comparison of quality,

not intensity.

Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse

than Star Trek V.

Are you joking?  Star Trek V is the standard

against which all badness is measured.

No, no.

 Star Trek V has specific failures

in writing and direction,

while Star Trek I fails across the board:

art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.

Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?

(scoffs):  Star Trek V.

All right, will you at least stipulate

that Star Trek IV:  The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?

I have three words for you:

 Wrath of Khan.

Oh, thank God, you're here.

What's the emergency?

I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.

Where?

On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield.

Where do you think? On Mars!

Howard, is everything okay?

Yeah, baby, I'll be right in.

You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?

Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She's a doctor.

One free barium enema,

and my mother won't care she's not Jewish.

Wait a minute.

So the eye patch and e insults worked?

No, there were three other guys with eye patches.

It was a fiasco.

What did work was, "How'd you like to visit

a secret government facility?"

So what exactly do you want us to do?

I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch

and I need you to get Stephanie out

before somebody notices she's here.

She doesn't exactly have clearance.

Really? They don't let strange women from honky-tonks come in

and play with $200 million government projects

on distant planets?

Yes, I was bad. Maybe she'll spank me.

Can we please move on?

Hey, Howard, you know, it's getting late,

so do I get to drive this thing or what?

Yeah. No. I'm sorry, but something's come up.

Kind of a Mars Rover... Mars Rover

can Howard come over...

situation.

So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.

Oh, okay. Let's go, friend Leonard.

Okay.

I'll call ya.

Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?

No one's a scientist like Howard.

My mother is so gonna love her.

How nice. Maybe they can carpool

when they visit you in federal prison.

I'm sorry. I totally interrupted you.

What, what, what were you saying?

Just said Howard's a terrific guy.

He's got a great sense of humor.

He loves his mother...

a lot.

People say "too much."

I really like that you're such a loyal friend.

Yeah, I am loyal.

You know, if you look at the big picture.

Out of curiosity,

did he ever have a shot with you?

Are you insane?

The guy was wearing an eye patch.

Then why did you...?

He said that I cou drive a car on Mars.

Got it.

So, can I see you again?

You're not gonna see me now.

Cool.

(typing)

Anything?

Actually, I was just checking my e-mail.

But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.

I believe the appropriate metaphor here

involves a river of excrement

and a Native American water vessel

without any means of propulsion.

Hang on.

There's got to be other options.

You could try calling Triple-A.

But based on NASA's latest timetable,

they won't get there for 35 years.

Plus I understand you have to be standing

next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.

Oh, snap.

Snap what?

Okay, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.

What's Plan B?

Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes,

wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.

Why wasn'that Plan A?

REPORTER: A NASA spokesman states that due to the loss of data,

they will most likely be unable to determine the cause

of the Mars Rover's malfunction.

This is not the first time an exploratory mission to Mars

has ended in disappointment.

Thank God for Plan B.

Howard, didn't you say you worked on the Mars Rover?

No, you're mistaken.

Yeah, when we first met,

you said that if I went out with you,

I could drive a car on Mars.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Psst! Psst!

Will you all excuse me?

Leonard is subtly signaling

that he'd like to talk to me in private.

No. Yeah, I remember specifically.

You started by asking if I was from Mars

because my ass was out of this world.

Well, that does sound like me, but no.

Is there some problem?

Yeah.

Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.

All right, good-bye.

No, wait!

If anyone asks you where I went, you don't know.

Where are you going?

I can't tell you that.

Who would ask me?

I can't tell you that, either.

So you brought me in here to inform me

that you can't tell me where you're going

and you can't tell me who might ask?

Yeah, I really didn't think this through.

Leonard, a moment.

What?

If someone-- and of course, we don't know who this would be--

does ask where you've gone, what should I say?

I don't know. Just tell 'em I went to the office.

Are you going to the office? No.

Then how can I say it convincingly?

Just say, "Leonard went totheoffice."

All right. Leonard went to the office.

What is...? No, not like that!

Just, "Leonard went to the office."

This would have worked out a lot better

if you'd just told me you were going tthe office.

I'm going to the office.

See? Why don't I believe you?

(TV playing)

I'm going out for a while.

Okay.

Doesn't anyone want to know where he's going?

Okay, where is he going?

Leonard is going to the office.

So how was work today?

Busy.

I removed an appendix, a gall bladder

and about a foot and a half of bowel.

I'm hoping that's three different guys.

No, just the one.

He didn't make it.

So, how was your day?

Oh, you know, I'm a physicist, so...

I thought about stuff.

That's it?

Well, I wrote some of it down.

Are you done eating?

Uh, yeah. Oh, good.

If I knew you were waiting,

I would've swallowed that lasagna whole.

(phone ringing)

You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett.

Leave a message. (beep)

WOLOWITZ: Hey, Steph,

it's me again, Howard.

Listen, if you're free Friday,

maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place.

My mom cooks a hell of a brisket.

Let me know.

It's Howard. (beep)

I've had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.

Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.

That's a good idea.

There's a bed in there, and I'm very...

very, very pro-bed.

(phone rging)

You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett.

Leave a message. (beep)

WOLOWITZ: Hey, it's me again.

Just want to let you know

the head count for dinner Friday has gone up.

My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs.

Oh, and if anybody should ask,

you're half-Jewish on your mother's side.

Okay, call me.

It's Howard. (beep)

Don't you think we should tell him you're not interested?

Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?

Dear God, no!

(Stephanie laughing): Oh, Leonard...

(phone ringing)

You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett.

Leave a message. (beep)

WOLOWITZ: Hey, it's me again. Howard.

Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale

are flying in to meet you

so that means we're gonna have to move the dinner

to a restaurant.

WOMAN (shrieking): Tell her we're going to the Olive Garden!

I have a coupon from the paper.

WOLOWITZ: We're not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Oh, Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.

WOLOWITZ: I'll call you back when we firm up the details.

It's Howard.

Oh, hey. Hey.

New shirts?

Yeah, a couple.

Nice. Thank you.

So, who's the girl?

I'm sorry?

Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.

So what we did was in fact dating?

Well, yeah, we did have a date.

Exactly. Thank you.

Do me a favor. Tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.

So, who is she?

Oh, she's a doctor.

Oh, nice.

A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?

Doctor doctor.

Surgical resident.

Smart, pretty.

Let me ask you something.

If your friend thinks he's dating someone,

but he's not because, in fact, you're dating her,

does that make you a bad person?

Well, that depends.

On what?

Is that friend Wolowitz?

Yeah.

Screw him. You're fine.

Are you sure?

Well, have you slept with her yet?

You dog!

Good for you.

Does that change things?

No.

So why'd you ask?

I'm nosy. See ya.

MRS. WOLOWITZ (shrieking): Howard, get the door!

WOLOWITZ (shouting): Really? Is that what you dohen someone knocks?!

Thank you. I had no idea!

Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Who is it?!

It's Leonard!

MRS. WOLOWITZ: You're gonna have to play outside!

I'm not dressed to receive!

No one cares, Ma!

(softly): So, what's up?

Listen, I need to talk to you about something.

(ringtone playing "She Blinded Me with Science")

 Momentito.

Yello.

Oh, Stephanie,

thanks for calling me back. I was worried...

Oh...

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh...

No, I understand.

Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely.

Thanks for calling.

Yeah, you have a nice day, too.

You are dead to me.

Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?

ALL: Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.

Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.

lizard-Spock.

(yelling)

Oh, hey, guys.

Hello. He

Hi, Howard.

Howard?

Sheldon.

Howard is employing

a schoolyard paradigm in which you are,

for all intents and purposes, deceased.

He intends

to act on this by not speaking to you,

feigning an inability to hear you when you speak

and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.

That's just ridiculous.

Why are you cooperating with him?

I don't make the rules, Leonard.

Howard, come on. I didn't plan on this.

These things just happen.

Usually not to me, but they do happen.

Did someone just feel a cold breeze?

I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor.

The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue

of a disembodied soul passing by.

You know, screw it. I'm just gonna eat the dumpling.

(knocking)

Hey. Oh, hi, Steph.

Come on in. Is this a bad time?

Yeah, but I don't see a better one on the horizon, so...

Oh, if it isn't Mrs. Dead to Me.

Hello, Howard.

Sheldon?

I'm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor

by acknowledging her existence. I'm out.

He just won't listen to me.

Okay, I guess it'll just be the three of us then.

Lisa's gonna be disappointed. Yeah.

Lisa?

Yeah, my roommate.

She just went throh a really bad breakup

and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.

Leonard, Stephanie, you're alive!

So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again

how much I enjoyed the other night,

and again, I'm sorry for how it ended.

But again, if you could let me know about Friday.

My mother needs a head count

so she can know how big a brisket to get.

Howard, Howard, look at this.

Anyway, call me.

The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists It's Howard.

and laypersons alike.

It's unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice,

but one thing's certain:

The data which it has sent back contain

the first clear indications

that there may have been life on Mars.

It's a scientific discovery

that has staggering implications for all mankind.

Unfortunately, we'll never know who's responsible.

Son of a bitch.

How much time do we have?

Uh, T-minus five hours,
37 minutes to onset of meteor shower.

Okay, our position
is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west.

That means the azimuth
should be 168.22 degrees...

relative to magnetic north
with an elevation of 49.93.

 Anything yet?
 Uh, we have a signal...

 ...but no frame lock.
 Hang on. How about now?

We did it. Ha, ha.
We have the West Coast feed of HBO.

Ooh, Real Sex.

Big deal. Every time I watch that...

it's old women putting condoms
on cucumbers.

All right,
let's see what's on the East Coast feed.

Oh, hey. Dune.

Not a great movie,
but look at that beautiful desert.

Too bad Sheldon couldn't come with us.

It's just not the same without him.

That was good. That was good.

Oh, this sucks.
I'm switching back to Real Sex.

Sheldon's log.

Stardate 63345.3.

While my colleagues are off
observing the Leonid meteor shower...

I've remained behind
to complete my paper...

on the decays
of highly excited massive string states.

Although my research is going well...

I do miss the warmth
of human companionship.

And good evening to you, Siam Palace.

This is Sheldon Cooper.

I'm going to be dining alone
this evening...

so I'll be reducing my usual order.

I'd like to start with one quarter
of the Assorted Appetizers Plate...

and one half
of the Golden Treasure for two...

Oh, for heaven's sake.
In the mid-18th century...

King Rama IV of Siam
divided a huge empire...

amongst the colonial powers of Europe
to preserve his throne.

Surely you, his cultural descendant,
can handle pad thai and dumplings.

Sheldon, help!

I need to go, but you keep in mind...

that my sharply worded comments
on Yelp.com...

recently took down
a local muffin store.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

Come in! Hurry!

 Penny?
 I'm back here.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

Oh, for God's sakes, I'm in the bathroom.

Shall I come back at a better time?

Get in here!

Hurry!

Don't you dare knock.

Hello.

I slipped in the shower.
I think I dislocated my shoulder.

Not surprising.

You have no safety mat
or adhesive stickers...

to allow for purchase on a surface
with a low coefficient of static friction.

What?

Tubs are slippery.

I know. I slipped.

I have a series of whimsical duck stickers
on the bottom of my tub.

Whatever. Will you just
turn the water off and help me up?

 They're holding umbrellas.
 Unh.

 What?
 The ducks in my tub.

Unh. Uh-huh.

They're whimsical,
because ducks have neither a need for...

nor the ability to use umbrellas.

Oh, my God.
I gotta go to the emergency room.

Assuming you're correct
that your humerus...

is no longer seated
in the glenoid socket, I would think so.

 Can you drive me?
 I don't drive.

Well, I can't drive.

Well, it seems we've reached an impasse.

Ow!

I could call you a cab or an ambulance.

No, no, no, I can't wait that long.
You gotta help me. Please?

All right. Let it never be said
that Sheldon Lee Cooper...

ignored the pleas
of a damsel in distress.

No one's saying that. Let's go.

It does seem rather ironic that
for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks...

we both might die in a fiery car crash.

I wish Penny didn't have to work.
She loves camping.

That would've been great.
You and Penny having sex in the tent...

while I sit out here
and watch Howard hump a cactus.

Okay, the best I can tell,
there are eight other campsites nearby.

Mostly science nerds like us,
but just over yon ridge...

are two not unattractive
middle-school teachers...

who reek of desperation.

 Wonderful. How old are they?
 I don't know, 50, 55?

Oh, menopause. Heh.

Nature's birth control.

Come on. You guys can't be that hard up.

 I am.
 Yeah, me too.

Look, they gave me homemade cookies.

Of course they did.
That's what grandmothers do.

 So, what are we waiting for?
 Relax.

I said we'd stop by a little later,
after they have their nap.

 Good idea. They'll be refreshed.
 Yeah.

 Cookie?
 Thank you.

Mmm.

 Mm. Not bad.
 Yeah, very tasty.

Tell me more about these teachers.

Not much to tell.
They had a VW Microbus...

and were wearing
tie-dyed Grateful Dead T-shirts.

Huh. Hm.

Good cookies.

I see no organizational system
in here whatsoever.

Which panties do you wear on Mondays?

I don't need panties.
I just need shorts and a shirt.

Mother always told me
one should wear clean underpants...

 ...in case one is in an accident.
 One was already in an accident.

Doesn't mean one won't be in another,
especially if I drive.

 Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes.
 Okay.

 Here.
 Seriously? Those shorts with that top?

All right.

No.

No.

Oh, that's cute.

We should have you checked
for a concussion.

Okay, now you gotta help me
put these on.

 All right.
 But don't look.

 Don't look?
 I don't want you to see me naked.

Oh. Well, that's understandable.

You may be interested to know
that a prohibition against looking...

is well established
in heroic mythology.

Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa...

 ...Orpheus and Eurydice...
 Great.

They always look. It never ends well.

You gotta help me
get my arm into the sleeve.

Okay.

Is that my arm?

Doesn't feel like an arm.

Then maybe you should let it go.

Alrighty.

Stars are pretty, aren't they?

Up above the world so high.

Like little diamonds in the sky.

That's beautiful, dude.

You should write that down
before someone steals it.

So when do the meteors get here?

The meteors don't get here.
The Earth is moving into their path.

I can feel it.

I can feel the Earth moving. Heh.

It's moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.

Okay, how's that?

Better, thanks.

Stars are pretty, aren't they?

What's so funny?

It's your American accent. Everything
you say sounds stupid. Ha-ha-ha.

"Stars are pretty, aren't they?"

For the record, I should let you know...

this is my first time
driving an actual motor vehicle.

 You have your learner's permit, right?
 Yes.

And I've logged a considerable number
of hours on a simulator.

 Good.
 Didn't work out well.

 All right. Can we go?
 One moment.

According to my Driver's Ed book,
the side mirror is properly adjusted...

when a portion of the driver's door
handle is visible in the lower right corner.

There's the handle. Back. Too far.

Bringing it back.

Optimized. Ahem.

Now, where is the switch
to adjust the passenger-side mirror?

It's right there.

Where is the passenger-side mirror?

In a parking lot in Hollywood.

 Now, can we please go?
 Yes. Soon as I adjust my seat.

Whee!

Oh, dear. I'm gonna have to start again.

If I could speak the language of rabbits...

they would be amazed
and I would be their king.

I hate my name.

It has "nerd" in it.

Leon-nerd.

I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.

I would be kind to my rabbit subjects.

At first.

You know what's a cool name?

Angelo.

That has "angel" and "Jell-O" in it.

It was my Uncle Murray's funeral.

We were all back
at my Aunt Barbara's house.

Our eyes locked over the pickled herring.

We never meant for it to happen.

One day, I hold a great ball
for the president of France.

But the rabbits,
they hate me and don't come.

I'm embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce
in the world and make them watch.

People could call me Angie.

"Yo, Angie. How's it going?"

To this day,
I can't look at pickled herring...

without being aroused and ashamed.

Oh, cousin Jeanie.

Could you please drive a little faster?

Oh, I think we're going sufficiently fast.

 What's that?
 Nothing.

 The engine does that sometimes.
 It can't be nothing.

The "check engine" light is on.
We need a service station.

The light's been on
since I bought the car.

All the more reason to consult
with a mechanic before it explodes.

It's not gonna explode. Just keep driving.

Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.

Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise.

He was the science officer.

I guarantee that if he saw the Enterprise's
"check engine" light blinking...

he would
pull the ship over immediately.

Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the arm.

Oop. Red light. Release accelerator...

and slowly apply the brake.

Nailed it.

While we have a moment...

 ...may I ask you a question?
 What?

Why do you have
the Chinese character for "soup"...

tattooed on your right buttock?

 It's not "soup." It's "courage."
 No, it isn't.

I suppose it does take courage...

to demonstrate
that kind of commitment to soup.

How did you see it?
You said you wouldn't look.

Sorry. As I told you,
the hero always peeks.

 Anything?
 No, that was the last pudding cup.

No.

What about Slim Jims?

That's what he used
to eat his pudding, remember?

Right. That was so good.

Sweetie and meaty at the same time.

Wait, wait, wait.
So you're saying we're out of food?

The only thing in here are blue-ice packs.

I know they're poison...

but they look like
big, yummy Otter Pops.

 Oh, God, I am so hungry.
 Me too.

Check and see
if we have any more pudding.

Okay.

All right. There's no need to bark at me.

According to the inexplicably
irritable nurse behind the desk...

you're after the man who claims
to be having a heart attack...

but appears to be well enough
to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone.

We have to fill these out.

"Describe illness or injury."

I dislocated my shoulder.

All right.

And "how did the accident occur?"

You already know that.

Cause of accident:
lack of adhesive ducks.

Okay, medical history.

 Have you been diagnosed with diabetes?
 No.

 Kidney disease?
 No.

 Migraines?
 Getting one.

 Are you currently pregnant?
 No.

Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.

Change migraine to "yes."

 "When was your last menstrual period?"
 Oh, next question.

I'll put "in progress."

Okay. Moving to psychiatric disorders.

"List all major behavioral diagnoses,
e.g. depression, anxiety, etc."

What the hell does this have to do
with my stupid shoulder?

Episodes of sub-psychotic rage.

 Ass.
 Possible Tourette's.

All right.
"Moles, lesions or other skin conditions."

"Soup" tattoo on right buttock.

Okay, Sheldon. Sheldon, look.
I am scared and in a lot of pain.

Could you please take a break
from being you for just a minute...

and try being,
I don't know, comforting?

Ahem. I'm sorry.

There, there.

Everything's going to be fine.

Sheldon's here.

Thanks. That's much better.

Oh, I'm so hungry.

Will you shut up? We're all hungry.

Okay, our objective
is the Boy Scout campsite to the east.

Easy target. Big, doughy scoutmaster,
couple of Cubs, mostly Webelos.

What kind of score?

Hot dogs, buns, s'mores.
I mean, it's a freaking 7-Eleven.

 All right. Everyone grab flashlights.
 Okay.

Oh, my God. Could it be? Yes!

My mother put an "I love you" brisket
in my backpack!

 Quick, get forks.
 Don't need forks.

It's so tender, it falls apart in your hands.

 He's right.
 Yes.

I feel like
we're forgetting something important.

Me too, but what?

Maybe a Tupperware bowl
of roasted potatoes and carrots?

LEONARD & RAJESH:
Yes!

Yes!

Now remember...

you were given powerful
pain medication and a muscle relaxer...

so don't operate heavy machinery.

Try not to choke on your own drool.

Wait. You have to help me get into bed.

Sheldon has to get me into bed.

Bet you never thought I'd say that.
Ha-ha-ha.

Yes.

The charm of your drug-addled candor
knows no bounds.

You know, people think
you're this weird robot man...

who's so annoying all the time,
and you totally are.

But then it's like that movie Wall-E
at the end.

You're so full of love
and you can save a plant...

and get fat people
out of the floaty chairs.

That's a fairly labored metaphor,
but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.

Sing "Soft Kitty" to me.

"Soft Kitty" is for when you're sick.
You're not sick.

Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.

Soft kitty, warm kitty
Little ball of fur

Wait, wait. Let's sing it as a round.

I'll start.

Soft kitty, warm kitty
Little ball of fur

See, that's where you come in.
I'll start over.

Soft kitty, warm kitty
Little ball of fur

I've got all night, Sheldon.

Soft kitty, warm kitty

 Little ball of fur
 Soft kitty, warm kitty

 Little ball of fur
 Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

 Happy kitty, sleepy kitty
 Purr, purr, purr

Purr, purr, purr

And the next morning when he woke up,
he rolled over and realized...

Da, da, da!

she was his cousin.

That's still not funny.

"That's still not funny."

And she was my second cousin.

"And she was my second cousin."

You're a real douche.

Who cares? You slept with your cousin.



Whatcha doin' there?

Working on a new plan
to catch the roadrunner?

The humorous implication being
that I am Wile E. Coyote?

Yes.

And this is a schematic
for a bird-trapping device

that will ultimately backfire
and cause me physical injury?

Yes.

What I'm doing here

is trying to determine
when I'm going to die.

A lot of people are working
on that research.

So what is all this?

My family history
factoring in longevity,

propensity for disease,
et cetera.

Interesting.

Cause of death for
Uncle Carl was KBB.

What's "KBB"?

"Killed by badger."

How's that?

It was Thanksgiving.

Uncle Carl said, "I think

"there's a badger living
in our chimney.

Hand me that flashlight."

Those were the last words

he ever spoke to us.

I don't think you need

to worry about death by badgers
being hereditary.

Not true.

The fight or flight instinct
is coded genetically.

Instead of fleeing, he chose
to fight barehanded

against a brawny member
of the weasel family.

Who's to say that I don't share
that flawed DNA?

You can always get a badger
and find out.

But seriously,

even if I disregard
the Uncle Carl factor,

at best I have 60 years left.

That long, huh?

60 only takes me to here.

I need to get to here.

What's there?

The earliest estimate
of the singularity,

when man will be able
to transfer his consciousness

into machines
and achieve immortality.

So, you're upset
about missing out

on becoming some sort of
freakish self-aware robot?

By this much.

Tough break.

You want eggs?

You don't get it, Leonard.

I'm going to miss so much--

the unified field theory,
cold fusion, the dogapus.

What's a dogapus?

The hybrid dog and octopus.

Man's underwater best friend.

Is somebody
working on that?

I was going to.

I planned on giving it to myself
on my 300th birthday.

Wait a minute.
You hate dogs.

A dogapus can play fetch
with eight balls.

No one can hate that.

 


What do we owe you?

It came to $28.17.

Let's say six bucks apiece.

Here you go.

Thank you.

What?

Never mind. I got it.

Oh, you wanted me to pay.

It's no big deal.
No, no, no, no.
You're right.

We're not going out anymore;
I should pay for myself.

What?

He said, "If he had
woman parts,

he'd eat for free
the rest of his life""

Yeah, but you wouldn't be able
to talk to yourself.

I'm a little low on cash.

How much you got?
Nothing.

How can you walk
around with no money?

I'm cute. I get by.

It's okay,
you can owe me.

Thank you.
Sheldon, six bucks.

No, thank you.
I'm not eating pizza tonight.

But it's Thursday.

Thursday's pizza night.

Not for me.

Thursday is now Cruciferous
Vegetable Night.

Tonight's selection:
Brussels sprouts.

Really?

You're changing the
Sheldonian calendar?

It's a small price to pay.
For what?

No, no, don't ask.
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

In order to live long enough
to fuse my consciousness

with cybernetics,
I need to change my diet.

Wait. Cybernetics is
robot stuff, right?

Correct.

So you want to turn yourself

into some sort of robot?

Essentially, yes.

Okay, here's my question.

Didn't you already do that?

No.

Flattering, but sadly, no.

I'm also planning
to begin an exercise regimen

designed to strengthen
my cardiovascular system.

AKA jogging.

Wait. Honey,
have you ever run before?

Certainly.

I've run from bullies, dogs,
angry chickens...

and one particularly
persistent P.E. teacher

determined to bend me over
and give me a scoliosis test.

You're right.
Penny jogs.

Maybe you guys
can run together.

That's an excellent idea.

Yeah, if we chat,

it will create the illusion
of time going faster.

No, it won't.

Um, how does he know I jog?

Oh, he watches you from his car
with high-powered binoculars.

Oh, my God, that is so creepy!

I know!

And he says he's
not gonna stop.

Then see a shrink
and figure out how
to talk to women.

What the hell?

What's the matter?

I have pain radiating
from my navel

to my lower right abdomen.

I'm nauseated
and feverish.

I believe I may have cholera.

There's no cholera
in Pasadena.

Just like last summer,

when there
was no malaria
in Pasadena.

Well, if it's not cholera,

then based on a quick
Internet search,

the other explanations in
decreasing order of likelihood

are Hirschsprung's Disease,
botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm

or accidental ingestion
of chrysanthemum blossoms.

When would you have accidentally
eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?

It's part of an
unlikely scenario

that involves sleepwalking
and a 24-hour flower mart

with a less-than-
vigilant proprietor.

Oh, Lord, my belly!

Ever had your
appendix out?

I haven't.

I've been meaning to,
but who has the time?

Let's get you
to the hospital.

So this is how it ends...

with cruel irony.

Just as I make the commitment
to preserving my body,

I am betrayed by my appendix,
a vestigial organ.

Do you know

the original purpose
of the appendix, Leonard?

No.

I do. And yet I'm doomed

while you live on.

Funny how things
work out, isn't it?

Oh, Lord, I think
it's about to burst!

On the other hand,

it might have been
the Brussels sprouts.

Good night.

Good night.

Appendicitis.

What a nervous Nelly.

Penny! Penny!

Penny!

Coming, coming.

Hey, nice knees.

Thank you.

They're my mother's.

Oh.
And the Flash
shirt is what?

Because, what,
you're gonna run really fast?

No, the Flash shirt is
because it's Friday,

but it's nice when
things work out.

Where's your
heart rate monitor?
I don't have one.

What about your pedometer?
Don't have one.

Do you have telematics
in your shoes connected
to an iPod?

Uh, no.
What do you do,

you just go out there
and gambol about
like a bunny?

No. I just run till I'm hungry,
then I stop for a bear claw.

Why are you doing that?

It's good to stretch your
muscles before you run.

All right.
All right,

let's start with a toe touch.

Okay, you do it.

I am doing it.

Oh. Wow. Good job.

Okay, um,

can you do this?

We'll never know.

Okay, let's just warm up
on the run.

Okay.
Okay, let's go.

I've been reading up
on biomechanics.

I think you'll be
surprised at my...

Oh, my God,
are you okay?

I think so.

Oh, let me
help you up.
Thank you.

Oh, Sheldon!

If it makes you
feel any better,

Thursday is no longer
Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

Here's my chicken curry.

Howard, your
shrimp biryani.

Thank you, sir.
Palak paneer,
that's Penny.

Thanks.
And for Rajesh
Koothrappali,

from whose homeland
these tasty dishes originate,

one large order of
chicken McNuggets.

Hey, what's my share?
Uh... 12 bucks.

Okay, can I get you after Friday
when I get paid?
Sure.

What am I up to now?

Well, okay, with
the Indian food, the pizza,

the Thai food, the tank of gas,

the frozen yogurt

and your rent, uh...

a little over $1,400.

What now?

He's just expressing
his admiration that

you don't even have to
put out to get free stuff.

It's not free-- I'm
gonna pay him back.

Shut up!

Sheldon, are you gonna join us?

Coming!

Greetings, friends.

Greetings, whatever
the hell you are.

I am a mobile
virtual presence device.

Recent events

have demonstrated to me
that my body is too fragile

to endure the vicissitudes
of the world.

Until such time as I am able

to transfer my consciousness,

I shall remain
in a secure location

and interact with the world
in this manner.

Really? That's
your question--

when did he
put a ramp in?

You're in my spot.

This may seem a little odd
at first,

but over time,
you'll grow accustomed

to dealing with me
in this configuration.

Yeah, to be honest, I
don't see much difference.

Thank you.

That's what I was going for.

Now, Leonard, tomorrow,
when we go to work,

you'll need to allow
some extra time

to get me down the stairs.

For your convenience,
I disassemble into four pieces.

This is ridiculous.

I'm coming to talk to you.

You don't know where I am.

My physical body
is safely ensconced

in a secure,
undisclosed location.

You're in your bedroom.

No, I'm not.

I can hear your voice
coming from your bedroom.

No, you can't.

Wait.

Come back.

Halt.

Authorized personnel only!

So, either one
of you weirdos

want to buy my underwear?
Only 1,400 bucks.

Sheldon,
this is ridiculous.

I'm behind you.

Please look at me when
you're talking to me.

I am looking at you.

No, you're not.

Pay no attention to
that man in the bed.

You cannot exist

as a virtual presence.

Not here
and certainly not at work.

Oh, good God.

At my age,
do you know

how I'm statistically
most likely to die?

At the hands of your roommate?

An accident.

That's how I'm going
to make it look.

Until I can transfer
my intellect

to a more durable container,

my body will remain
safely ensconced in my bed.

Fine, but don't expect my help.

You have to help--
it's in the roommate agreement.

No, it's not.

Section 74.C.

The various obligations
and duties of the parties

in the event one of
them becomes a robot.

I'll be damned.

This is delightful.

Uh-huh.

It's much easier to enjoy

the picturesque route
we travel to work

when you remove the specter
of fiery vehicular death.

Refresh my memory.

Why didn't I just put you
in the trunk?

Because I called shotgun.
Remember?

Right.

You seem tense.

Perhaps this will relax you.

I don't want to listen
to music, Sheldon.

Very well.

I don't understand
why you're not enjoying this.

Together, in this car,
with my enhanced capabilities,

we're like Knight Rider.

Except in Knight Rider, the car
isn't a yammering sphincter.

You mock the sphincter,

but the sphincter
is a class of muscle

without which human beings
couldn't survive.

There are over 50
different sphincters

in the human body.

How many can you name?

I was wrong-- this is exactly
like Knight Rider.

Perhaps you'd be interested
in a different game.

No.

This is a photograph of the 1911

Solvay Conference on the theory
of radiation and quanta.

Using Photoshop, I've
introduced a few anachronisms.

See if you can spot all 24.

I'll give you the first one.

Madame Curie should not
be wearing a digital watch.

And go.

That's it. Bye-bye.

Bazinga.
Whoa!

I have an override switch.

I almost died!

And I'm safe and sound in bed.

Who's crazy now?

I'm still going
to go with you.

Hello, Professor Hoskins.

Nice to see you, Mindy.

And konnichiwa, Dr. Nakamora.

Sorry the Swedes
disproved your theory.

Leonard, my door.

What about it?

Be a lamb and open it for me.

Why? What's the problem?

You think you have me stymied,
don't you?

No, I think a doorknob
has you stymied.

Oh, look, it's Leonard
and R2-D-Bag.

That's my joke.
I told it last night.

You can't just use it.

Raj, be a lamb
and open the door for me.

Oh, sure.

He's a lamb.

You're not.

I'm a lamb.

Isn't this nice?

The pleasures of fellowship
and camaraderie

without having to tolerate
your germy breath on my skin.

I say we just take him
to Tatooine

and sell him to some Jawas.

That's two, dude.

Write your own jokes.

Oh, great.

Hi, I'm Penny,
I'll be your waitress.

Why are you introducing
yourself?

I'd rather people not know

I have any prior connection
to you whatsoever.

Can you tell me
the specials this evening?

Sheldon, I'm not waiting on you.

Obviously.

I don't even have
water yet.

Because you're not here.

That's discrimination
against the otherwise located.

I'm going to have
to go over your head.

Manager... manager.

Oh, Lord,
look who it is.

Is that Steve Wozniak?

I think it is.

The Great and Powerful Woz.

Penny,
Steve Wozniak was

one of the cofounders

of Apple Computer.

He and Steve Jobs started it...
Yeah,

I know who he is.
I watch Dancing with the Stars.

I must speak to him.

Of course you must.

You know, there's an
Olive Garden down the street.

You guys should try it sometime.

Excuse me,
Mr. Wozniak?

Oh, hey.

Nice virtual presence device.

Thank you.

I just want to say
I'm a big fan.

You're my 15th favorite
technological visionary.

Only 15th?

It's still six spots
above Steve Jobs.

I care neither for turtlenecks

nor showmanship.

Yeah, I never got
that turtleneck thing.

One of my proudest possessions
is a vintage 1977 Apple Two.

Despite the file system
limitations of Apple DOS 3.3,

it was a pretty nifty
little achievement.

Thanks, we were shooting
for "nifty."

You know, if you had it here,

I'd autograph it for you.

Don't move
for 15 to 30 minutes,

depending on how
the buses are running.

Nerds.

I'm coming, Woz, I'm coming.

Ow!

Oh!

Aw.

Penny... Penny... Penny.

What up, Shel-Bot?

I can't get out of bed.

I hurt my ankle.

What do you want me to do?

Sing me "Soft Kitty."

Really, you want me
to sing "Soft Kitty"

to a computer monitor?

Would you rather come over
and sing it to me in person?

 Soft kitty, warm kitty 

 Little ball of fur... 

Closer to the microphone.

 Happy kitty,
sleepy... 

No.

You have to start over.

 Soft kitty,
warm kitty 

 Little ball of fur 

 Happy kitty,
sleepy kitty 

 Purr, purr, purr. 






Hey, guys, some of the other waitresses
wanted me to ask you something.

 It's Tressling.
 It combines the physical strength...

of arm wrestling with the mental agility
of Tetris into the ultimate sport.

That's terrific, but what they wanted me
to ask you is to cut it the hell out.

All right, come on, guys. Come on.

Happy birthday to you

We might as well stop, it's a stalemate.

You're beating me in Tetris, but you've got
the upper body strength of a Keebler elf.

Keebler elf?
I got a Keebler elf right here.


Okay, it's a stalemate.

Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday
for your free birthday cheesecake?

He can't eat cheesecake.
He's lactose intolerant.

Okay, he can have carrot cake.

 What about the cream-cheese frosting?
 He can scrape it off.

Forget about the cake.
How did you know my birthday's Saturday?

I did your horoscope, remember?

I was gonna do everybody's until Sheldon
went on one of his psychotic rants.

For the record, that psychotic rant...

was a concise summation
of the research of Bertram Forer...

who, in 1948, proved conclusively...

through meticulous experiments...

that astrology
is pseudoscientific hokum.

Blah, blah, blah. Typical Taurus.

 So we gonna see you Saturday?
 I don't think so.

 Why not?
 I don't celebrate my birthday.

Shut up. Yeah, you do.

It's no big deal.
It's the way I was raised.

My parents focused
on celebrating achievements...

and being expelled from a birth canal
was not considered one of them.

 That's so silly.
 It's actually based on very sound theories.

 His mother published a paper on it.
 Well, what was it called?

"I Hate My Son
and That's Why He Can't Have Cake"?

It was obviously effective.

Leonard grew up to be
an experimental physicist.

Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas,
he'd be a little better at it.

Thank you.

Well, I love birthdays. Waking up
to Mom's special French-toast breakfast...

wearing the birthday king crown,
playing laser tag with all my friends.

Yeah, see? That's what kids should have.

Actually, that was last year.

So you've really never had
a birthday party?

No, but it was okay.

When I was little, I'd think my parents
would change their mind and surprise me.

This one birthday,
I came home from my cello lesson...

and I saw strange cars
parked out front.

When I got to the door,
I hear whispering...

and I could smell German chocolate cake,
which is my favorite.

 And?
 It turns out my grandfather had died.

Oh, my God, that's terrible.

Well, it was kind of like a birthday party.

I got to see all my cousins,
and there was cake, so...

 That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
 You think?

Go ahead,
tell her about your senior prom.

Make sure they remember, no peanuts.

Howard, every Thai restaurant in town
knows you can't eat peanuts.

When they see me coming,
they go, "Ah, no-peanut boy."

 Hello, Penny, Leonard just left.
 I know, I wanna talk to you.

What would we talk about?

We have no overlapping
areas of interest I'm aware of.

 As you know, I don't care for chitchat.
 Can you just let me in?

Well, all right, but I don't see this
as a promising endeavor.

Okay, here's the deal.

We'll throw Leonard a kickass
surprise party for his birthday.

I hardly think so.

Leonard made it clear
he doesn't want a party.

Did someone say party?

He just doesn't know he wants one,
because he's never had one.

I suppose that's possible.

But for the record, I've never had
a threesome and yet I still know I want one.

Here's the difference.

The possibility exists
Leonard could have a birthday party...

before hell freezes over.

Fine. If I do have a threesome,
you can't be part of it.

I'm just kidding. Yes, you can.

Can you bring a friend?

I think a birthday party is a terrible idea.

I envy Leonard for growing up
without that anguish.

Anguish?

Year after year,
I had to endure wearing conical hats...

while being forced into the crowded,
sweaty hell of bouncy castles.

Not to mention being blindfolded...

and spun toward
a grotesque tailless donkey...

as the other children mocked
my disorientation.

Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars
that no non-professional can heal...

but nevertheless, we're gonna
throw Leonard a birthday party.

I'm extremely uncomfortable
with dancing...

loud music and most other forms
of alcohol-induced frivolity.

 Nevertheless...
 In addition...

You either help me
throw Leonard a birthday party...

or I will go into your bedroom...

and unbag all
your mint-condition comic books.

And on one of them... You won't know
which... I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.

You can't do that. If you make a mark
in a mint comic book, it's no longer mint.

Do you understand
the concept of blackmail?

Well, of course, I... Oh.

Yeah, I have an idea. Let's throw Leonard
a kickass birthday party.

That's not the secret knock.

This is the secret knock:

What difference does it make?

The point of a secret knock
is to establish a nonverbal signal...

to verify the identity
of one's coconspirators.

 Possibly, but unverified.

Would you just let us in?

Luckily for you,
this is not a nuclear reactor.

So, what'd you get the birthday boy?

Raj got him an awesome
limited-edition Dark Knight sculpture...

based on Alex Ross'
definitive Batman.

And I got him this amazing autographed
copy of The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

Nice. I got him a sweater.

Okay, well, he might like that.
I've seen him get chilly.

 Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
 That's because I didn't bring one.

 Why not?
 Don't ask.

The entire institution of gift-giving
makes no sense.

 Too late.
 Let's say I go out and I spend $50 on you.

It's a laborious activity
because I have to imagine what you need...

where you know what you need.

I could simplify things,
just give you the $50 directly...

and then you could give me $50
on my birthday and so on...

until one of us dies,
leaving the other one old and $50 richer.

And I ask you, is it worth it?

Told you not to ask.

Well, Sheldon, you're his friend.
Friends give each other presents.

I accept your premise,
I reject your conclusion.

Try telling him
it's a non-optional social convention.

 What?
 Just do it.


It's a non-optional social convention.

Ah, fair enough.

He came with a manual.

Question, how am I going to get Leonard
a present before the party?

I don't drive and the things available
in walking distance...

are a Thai restaurant
and a gas station.

I could wrap up an order of mee krob
and a couple of lottery scratchers.

Okay, let's do this.
I will drive Sheldon to get a present.

 Howard, get rid of Leonard for two hours.
 No problem.

And then, Raj, you bring the stuff
across the hall and start setting up.

 What if guests show up?
 Entertain them.

What if they're women?

Stare at them
and make them feel uncomfortable.



 Hey.
 Hey.

 How's it going?
 Fine.

So listen, the Nuart is showing the revised,
definitive cut of Blade Runner.

 Seen it.
 No.

You've seen
the 25th Anniversary Final Cut.

This one has eight seconds
of previously-unseen footage.

They say it completely changes
the tone of the film.

Pass.

Come on. Afterwards, there's a Q&A
with Harrison Ford's body double.

Look, I am in the "Halo" battle
of my life here.

There's this kid in Copenhagen,
he has no immune system.

So all he does is sit in his bubble
and play "Halo" 24/7.

Can't you play him some other time?

Not if you believe his doctors.

Oh, my God, do you smell gas?

 No.
 Yeah, no.

You know, they have DVDs over there.

Yes, but they have DVD burners
over here.

Leonard needs a DVD burner.

Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be
something someone needs.

It should be something fun.

 Something they wouldn't buy for themself.
 You mean, like a sweater?

Well, it's a fun sweater.
It's got a bold geometric print.

 Is it the geometry that makes it fun?
 Okay.

The point is, one of the ways
we show we care about people...

is by putting thought and imagination
into the gifts we give them.

 Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.
 Exactly.

Something he wouldn't buy for himself,
something fun, something like... Ah!

An 802. 11n wireless router.

Here you go, Copenhagen boy.

How about a taste
of Hans Christian hand grenade?



That could not feel good.

Come on, come on. Oh, you clever...

Come on, come on.

Take that.

Uh-oh.

Uh-oh.

 What's the matter?
 This granola bar has peanuts in it.

 Oh, my God. Why did you eat it?
 I don't know, it was just there.

Well, if I had a gun there,
would you have shot yourself?

Don't yell at me.

 I've gotta go to the emergency room.
 Now?

No, after my tongue has swollen
to the size of a brisket.

All right, just let me get my keys.

Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God...

The laundry is out of the hamper.

Okay, Sheldon,
what was it supposed to be?

Fine, it's out of the washer.

I'll call you when it's in the dryer.

All right, let's go.



 What do you think?
 Um, that one.

 Because of the additional Ethernet ports?
 Sure.

He doesn't need them.
He's got a six-port Ethernet switch.

 Oh, okay, then this one.
 Why?

I don't know.
The man on the box looks so happy.

Penny, if I'm going to buy Leonard a gift,
I'm going to do it right.

I refuse to let him experience
the same childhood trauma I did.

I know I'm gonna regret this,
but what trauma?

On my 12th birthday,
I really wanted a titanium centrifuge...

so, you know,
I could separate radioactive isotopes.

Of course, yeah.

Instead of a titanium centrifuge,
my parents bought me...

Wow, this is hard.

They got me a motorized dirt bike.

No.

What 12-year-old boy
wants a motorized dirt bike?

All of them.

 Really?
 Yeah.

Huh.

 So we're getting this one?
 Yeah, I suppose.

All right, let's go.

Excuse me,
do you know anything about this stuff?

I know everything about this stuff.

Okay, I have my own
wholesale flower business.

I wanna hook up my computer
in the front...

with the one
in my refrigerated warehouse.

Buy this one, it's the one we're getting.
Happy guy.

No, she doesn't want that.

She needs a point-to-point peer network
with a range extender.

 Thank you.
 Which hard drive do I want?

 FireWire or USB?
 It depends on what bus you have available.

I drive a Chevy Cavalier.

Oh, dear Lord.

 We have to go.
 Not now, this poor man needs me.

You, hold on, I'll be right with you.

What computer do you have,
and please don't say a white one.

 Excuse me.
 Fill this out and have a seat.

We're throwing
my friend a surprise party...

and I'm supposed to keep him out
for two hours.

Uh-huh. Fill this out and have a seat.

The way I could get him
to leave was tell him I ate a peanut.

I'm allergic to peanuts.

Well, in that case,
fill this out and have a seat.

All I need from you
is to give me a BAND-AID.

I can pretend I had epinephrine.

Tell my friend you need to keep me
under observation for an hour.

 Is that all you need?
 Yes.

Get out of my ER.

 No, you don't understand.
 I understand.

But unfortunately, this hospital
is not equipped to treat stupid.

Okay, I get it.
I know how the world works.

How about if I were to introduce you
to the man who freed your people?

Unless my people were freed
by Benjamin Franklin...

and his five twin brothers,
you are wasting your time.

Hey. Sorry, I couldn't find a parking spot.
How are you doing?

Bad, very bad.

Really? You don't look
like you're swelling up.

We should pick up Benadryl
at the drugstore and go home.

 We can't go home.
 Why not?

Because... Phbbtt!

Brisket. Brisket.

 Water, need water.
 I'll be right back.


 Penny, listen, I've got a problem.
 Yeah, well, so do I.

 You gotta stall Leonard longer.
 I don't think I can.

You have to.
We all have to be there to yell "surprise."

You have to understand something.
We're in a hospital right now.

Why? Is Leonard okay?

Leonard's fine. I'm fine,
thanks for asking, by the way.

Okay, I don't need your attitude.
Just hold him there a little longer.

I've done my best, but he wants to go home
and I don't know how to stop him.

Okay, how about this?

Keep him longer,
when you get to the party...

I'll point out which of my friends
are easy.

Don't toy with me, woman.

I got a former fat girl
with no self-esteem.

A girl who punishes her father
by sleeping around.

An alcoholic who's two tequila shots
away from letting you wear her like a hat.

Thy will be done.

I'm doing this for you, little buddy.

Okay, we don't have that in stock...

but I can special-order it for you.

Him.

Excuse me, sir, you don't work here.

Yes, well, apparently,
neither does anyone else.

 Sheldon, we have to go.
 Why?

We're late for Leonard's birthday party...

and for another,
I told him to call security.

Good luck.

By the way, a 6-year-old
could hack your computer.

Keep walking.

Yeah, 1234 is not a secure password.

My friend
is having allergic reaction to peanuts.

 No, he's not.
 Yes, he is.

Look, sir, we are very busy here
and I just don't...

Holy crap.

Please help me.

Code four. I need a gurney.

 Right away, right away.
 Thank you.

Say what you will
about healthcare in this country...

but when they're afraid of lawsuits,
they sure test everything.

the colonoscopy was necessary.

Before you got all swollen up...

I thought you're trying to keep me out
of the apartment...

so you could throw me
a surprise party.

Oh, right, it's your birthday.

I had no idea it was your birthday.
I forgot.

What a lousy way to spend a birthday.
Well, it's all over now.

There is a party, isn't there?

Maybe.

Howard.

 Are you mad?
 How could I be mad?

You actually risked your life
because you care about me.

Yeah, that's why I did it.

All right, here we go.

My first birthday party.


I see your true colors

And that's why I love you

Dude, everybody left an hour ago.

Surprise.

Okay, Leonard...

here I am at your birthday party.

I don't know where you are, dude,
but it's really kickass.

Everyone is very, very drunk and...
Ooh, mmm.

Oh, and look,
there's a girl taking her shirt off.

That's my friend Carol.

Remind me,
I gotta introduce her to Howard.

shake that rupee maker.

 I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.
 It's okay.

Well, happy birthday anyways.

Hey, Penny, when's your birthday?



Look at us, getting ready
for a double date with actual women...

who publicly acknowledge
they're our girlfriends.

Yes. I mean,
actual women are the best.

I don't understand.
What other kind of women are there?

Artificial women are your department.
You wanna take this?

No, it would just freak him out.

Listen, before we leave,
I should warn you...

I'm a passionate man...

and I tend towards
public displays of affection.

What are you trying to tell me, Howard?

There might be making out
in the car or restaurant.

I don't want Bernadette
to feel uncomfortable...

so it would help
if you and Penny made out too.

Don't worry, we're planning to have sex
right on the salad bar.

Namaste, white people.

Good news. I've rented us...

 ...the four-hour edition of Watchmen.
 Got it.

 Seen it.
 Detailed analysis posted online.

Then what are we gonna do tonight?

Sorry. Howard and I are going out
with Penny and Bernadette.

Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights
for me and Leonard.

These broncos have been saddled.

How did we get actual women?

Great. They get girlfriends
and they just abandon us?

It is great, isn't it?

We have a wonderful evening
ahead of us.

 We do?
 Oh, yes.

I discovered I don't have enough room
on my hard drive for a LINUX partition.

You and I are gonna perform
a full backup, reinitialize...

and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

 I don't wanna do that.
 All right.

Well, I'm going to perform
a full backup, reinitialize...

and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

Well, what about me?

Well, I understand there are
several types of artificial women.

Maybe you should look into that.

Dude, there are so many cool things
we could be doing tonight. Look.

At the Glendale Galleria:
"Put on your best zoot suit.

It's a salute to swing music...

in the center court near Macy's,
5 p.m. to 9 p.m."

Huh? Huh?

A salute to zoot.

 Sounds like a hoot.
 I'm sorry, Raj.

I have no desire
to salute any article of clothing tonight...

much less one that's linked
to race riots in the 1940s.

Race riots?

The Zoot Suit Riots.

Oh.

I always thought that was
some sort of after-Christmas sale.

Why don't we go to the galleria
and walk around?

I don't need anything at the galleria.
You need anything at the galleria?

No, we would just walk around
and see what's what.

That's a semantically null sentence.

Okay, well, how about this?
From the university website:

"Seven p.m. to 10 p.m.,
Norton Hall Multipurpose Room...

mixer for grad students
and faculty...

of the Science
and Humanities Departments.

Whether you split atoms or infinitives,
this is the place to be."

Well, that's certainly amusing...

but I have no interest.

Come on, Sheldon.

The world is filled with people
doing things outside.

Let's go outside. Outside is good.

If outside is so good...

why has mankind spent thousands
of years trying to perfect inside?

I don't know. It's a marketing scheme.

Please, Sheldon, I'm a young,
virile visitor from a foreign land...

and I need to strut my stuff.

Let me offer you a compromise.

Sometimes when I feel stifled
and want a change of scenery...

I use my imagination.

Oh, boy.

One of my favorite places to visit
is the two-dimensional world...

described in Edwin Abbott's
mathematical fantasy Flatland.

I don't wanna go to Flatland.

You're only saying that
because you haven't been there.

I am now a hexagon
in two-dimensional space...

and can only perceive the edges
of other objects.

Oy.

Is that you, Raj?
I don't recognize your edge.

Sheldon, I'm begging you.

I want to go to this mixer,
and I don't want to go alone.

Well, you're in luck.
There's a mixer here in Flatland.

Oh, look.

There's a sexually attractive
line segment.

 Chat her up.
 What?

Tell her you're a circle.
Flatland gals are all hot for circles.

I hope you're hungry.
We're going to a terrific restaurant.

Oh, yeah, I'm starved.
When you spend all day in a bio lab...

watching flesh-eating bacteria
skeletonize rodents...

it really works up an appetite.

Flesh-eating bacteria
and yet I still wanna kiss this woman.

What does that tell you?

You'd be willing to die a horrible death on
the off chance you'd get to second base.

We're way past second base.
Right, Howard?

Well, we kind of disagree
about what the bases are.

How's your work going, Penny?
Any acting jobs?

The last big thing I did
was this production...

of Diary of Anne Frank
above a bowling alley.

But I think things
might be turning around pretty soon.

Well, great. How come?

Well, promise you won't
make fun of me?

Of course.
I would never make fun of you.

Okay, well, I went to this psychic
who told me that if I cut my hair...

I'm gonna get
a national commercial.

What? Seriously?

You're getting career advice
from a psychic?

Good job not making fun of her.

She's not one of those phonies, okay?
She wrote a book, has her own website.

Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?

They don't just let anyone
have a website.

 Why are you being such a jerk?
 You're surprised?

Your psychic didn't tell you
I was going to be a jerk?

Heh, heh. Bite me.

 Come on, Penny.
 Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?

We're gonna make out back here.

I'm sliding into third.

Thanks for coming with me.

Thanks for giving me your limited edition
Green Lantern lantern.

Did you really have to bring it
with you?

What if evil strikes
and my power ring runs low?

 Come on, let's get a drink.
 I don't drink.

Well, I do.

And when my wingman is carrying
a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot.

I'll have a screwdriver, please.
And don't be chintzy with the screw.

I would like a root-beerfloat.

 Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.
 They don't?

Well, apparently these people and I
differ greatly on the definition of "party."

 He'll have a Shirley Temple.
 And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.

 Okay, let's check out the females.
 All right.

There's a female.

That's Professor Wilkinson's wife.
She's like 80.

But she's female. Isn't that the game?

 No. I'm looking for a hookup.
 Oh, yes.

So the point of this exercise is for you
to find someone to copulate with?

Not so loud. But ideally, yes.

 Thanks.
 Thank you.

And what is my function as wingman?

 You help me run my game.
 Okay.

And what is your game?

When I lie through my teeth to a woman,
you nod and agree.

Hey, that's pretty cool. What is it?

It's a limited edition
Green Lantern lantern.

My friend is looking for someone
to copulate with.

You're very funny. I'm Abby.

 I'm Sheldon.
 How do you do?

Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
Call me Raj.

 Hey, Raj. Where are you from?
 The mysterious subcontinent of India.

 Ooh. India.
 You know India?

 I saw Slumdog Millionaire.
 Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.

I thought your father
was a gynecologist.

I'm sorry.

Martha, come here.
Meet Raj and Sheldon.

 My friend Martha.
 Hi.

 Hello.
 Hello.

Is that the limited edition
Green Lantern lantern?

In brightest day, in darkest night,
no evil shall escape my sight.

Oh, that is so awesome.

Thank you.

Have you chosen one
to copulate with?

So, what should we talk about?

Well, we could always learn more...

about why people who believe
in psychics are idiots. Leonard?

We don't need
to talk about that anymore.

Leonard covered it pretty well
in the car.

I'm sorry, but facts are facts.

Right, and if you can't understand it,
it's not a fact.

No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.

 Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.
 Oh, you're welcome.

 How's your fish?
 Amazing.

 Would you like to try some?
 Yeah, sure.

Well, the fact is you can't.

Howard, Bernadette,
you're both scientists.

Help me out here.

Wanna jump in the middle
of another couple's argument?

 No, thank you.
 Sorry.

Maybe we should just stop talking
about this.

Maybe some of us
should stop talking altogether.

 How is everything tonight?
 Really uncomfortable.

The best thing about a monogamous,
mutually supportive relationship...

is even if you have different ideas...

you can have a spirited debate,
yet still care for, even make love...

You want your fish?

Knew you were gonna do that.
Doesn't make me psychic.

Attaboy, Leonard. Make it worse.

American woman

Listen what I say

What's going on?

We scored.

I'm the wingman.

American woman

 Hey.
 Laser.

Had a great night last night.

I don't like to kiss and tell,
but somebody made it to eighth base.

 What the hell is eighth base?
 Seventh base with shirt off.

Well, my shirt.

 How'd things go with Penny?
 Oh, couldn't be better.

Are we taking
our relationship frustrations out...

on innocent Cylons?

It's not just Cylons. Superman's next.

I was gonna try to squeeze in
a little more mocking before lunch...

but I can come back when
you don't have a high-powered weapon.

How can I go out with a woman
who believes in psychics?

Hey, I once dated a girl who believed
she was abducted by aliens.

And that didn't bother you?

Au contraire, it meant she was gullible
and open to a little probing.

What am I supposed to do?

Pretend I believe something I don't
when I'm with Penny?

Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes
all kinds of things when she's with you.

Do me a favor.
Lean over, put your head right here.

Let me show you another way
to look at this.

Here we have the universe
of all women.

Okay, these are the ones
you wanna sleep with.

These are the women
who believe exactly what you believe.

These are the women
who would be willing to sleep with you.

And right there,
in the little triple intersection...

is your ideal mate.

Odds are she's a short physicist
with low self-esteem...

who lives in a government
research facility in China.

What's your point?

To keep having a sexual relationship
with Penny...

I have to give up everything I believe in?
My intellectual integrity?

The very nature of who I am?
I can't do that, Howard.

I respect that.

 What is that?
 Your new girlfriend.

Have fun tonight.

"The dog."

"The roof."

"Grapes."

One minute.

 What was that?
 It means, "Come in."

It's taking forever to load the new
operating system on my computer.

I disinfected the kitchen
and the bathroom.

Now I thought I'd learn Finnish.

That's Hindi for,
"Whatever floats your boat."

Listen, I got a text
from that girl Abby...

and she and Martha
wanna hang out with us again.

 What do you say?
 I don't say anything.

I merely offer you a facial expression
that suggests you've gone insane.

 I don't get it. You had a great time.
 Yes, exactly. I had a great time.

That's done.
I've moved on to other things.

For example, after I learn Finnish,
I'm not going to learn Finnish again.

Please, Sheldon.

I'm a lost Indian boy far from home...

and I want a girlfriend,
and I want her to be Abby...

and she'll only come
if she can bring Martha.

I highly doubt
there is any argument you can make...

threat you might levy,
rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation...

supplication or "vetoomus"
that you can employ...

that would convince me
to reconsider.

My Incredible Hulk hands
signed by Stan Lee.

Oh, my.

I've admired these for years.

Does that mean
we can go out with the girls again?

Hulk agree to second date
with puny humans.

You can't wear the hands on the date.

Hulk sad.

Hey.

Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?

Not only is it courteous,
it's safety-smart.

Every year, 15,000 fires are caused
by accidental dryer-lint ignition.

And now you're supposed to say,
"Wow, what an interesting fact.

Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy.
I could never be mad at you."

Wow. That's all you got after you were
the most obnoxious person...

on a double date
that included Howard Wolowitz?

No, I'm sorry. I really am.

It's not right
to mock what a person believes in.

Thank you.

You willing to go to my psychic
and see what it's about?

You willing to read a book...

that concisely explains
how all psychics are frauds?

I would not.

 Okay, let's go see your psychic.
 Really?

Well, yeah.
One of us has to keep an open mind.

 Saying I don't have an open mind?
 No. Let me help you with this stuff.

You know, I believe in ghosts too.

 Great.
 And astrology.

I know.
And pyramid power and healing crystals.

Oh, no, no, no. Crystals don't work.

Really? That's the line?

Psychics are real,
but crystals are voodoo?

Oh, voodoo's real.
You don't wanna mess with voodoo.

Flatland is more
than just a mathematical essay.

It is also a treatise
on Victorian social mores.

You know,
I had never considered that.

Wow. I mean, that's going
to completely change my visits there.

 Well, it's late.
 Uh-huh.

Time for bed.

Okay.

Good night, puny human.

Sheldon?

Yes?

Listen, they're kind of getting busy
in the living room...

and I was wondering
if I could hang out in here for a while.

Well, I suppose. Come in.

I'll sleep in Leonard's room.
Good night.



Feel like trying something new
for dinner?

Maybe Indian? Tex-Mex?

Ever wonder how humans would
be different if they evolved...

from lizards instead of mammals?

Okay, let's talk about that.

As you know,
lizards, cold-blooded animals...

lack the ability to sense temperature.

But they do move more sluggishly
when it's cold.

So lizard weathermen
would say things like:

"Bring a sweater, it's slow outside."

I love my mind.

We all do. Now, how about dinner?

Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects
or smaller lizards.

We could also pull each other's tails off
and grill them. They'll just grow back.

Oh!

My life-size cardboard
Mr. Spock is here.

I know he wouldn't care
for an outburst of human emotion...

but, oh, goodie, oh, goodie,
oh, goodie.

Commander Spock requesting
permission to be unfolded.

 Excuse me.
 Permission granted, commander.

which is why the more intelligent
the monkey, the more feces they fling.


Excuse me, Amy.
Uh, Penny, do you have plans for dinner?

 You guys going somewhere?
 No, just you and me.

You mean, like a date?

Not like a date, a date.

Ooh.

Um...

Okay. Sure.

Ooh.

Oh, no. They sent the wrong Spock.

Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.

This is so exciting. If Leonard
and Penny get back together...

Howard and I can go
on double dates with them.

How come you never invite
Sheldon and me on a double date?

Uh...

How's it going in there, Penny?

Just a sec.

Too much?

 Yes.
 No.

Okay. Just hang on.

You just can't handle her raw sexuality,
can you?

When did you and Leonard break up?

Uh, about two years ago.

Why do you think
he asked you out again?

 Maybe he's dying.

That would be so romantic.

He's not dying.

Too bad.

If he were, she could throw him in bed
and ride him right up until he flatlines.

How about this?

 Maybe.
 Come on.

Yeah, okay, no.

Do you think you'll sleep with him
tonight?

dinner and, you know, see how it goes.

If he were dying,
would you sleep with him?

 Assuming he were dying...

of something that couldn't
be sexually transmitted.

You know,
like a spear wound to the head.

Okay, he is not dying.

How do you know? Are you a doctor?

You can make-believe though.

Sometimes Howard and I pretend
that his arrhythmia is acting up...

and I'm a sexy cardiologist...

and the naughty part is
I'm not in his HMO network.

Screw it. I'm not gonna make
a big deal out of this. It's just dinner.

With a dead man. Rawr.

Amy, stop it.

Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

Relax. You know Leonard's always been
crazy about you. It's gonna be great.

We've finally gotten to a place where
we can hang out without it being weird.

 If something goes wrong, then what?
 It'll just be Sheldon and me...

going on a double date
with Howard and Bernadette.

Sure. We'd love that.

Change your clothes,
we got a lot riding on this.

Hmm.

I want to build a road,
but I need wood.

Do either of you fellows have wood?


I don't understand the laughter.

The object of Settlers of Catan
is to build roads and settlements...

to do so requires wood.
Now, I have sheep, I need wood.

Who has wood for my sheep?


Okay. How do I look?

More to the point,
why are you doing this?

 What are you talking about?
 You forget what Penny did to you?

It took you two years and defiling my
sister to turn that frown upside down.

I didn't defile your sister,
we had a relationship.

I heard you call her Brown Sugar.

In my book that's defilement.

 You wanna know my opinion?
 Oh, boy, do I.

Sarcasm?

No.

All right, then.

The reason you're fixated on
a good-natured simpleton like Penny...

is that she's the exact opposite
of your first romantic attachment...

your brilliant, yet intimidating,
mother.

Where on earth did you get that from?

It's in her book
Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.

That doesn't make it true.

It's called non-fiction for a reason,
Leonard.

See you later.

If they make a movie version
of that book...

you know who should play
Leonard's mother? Sandra Bullock.

 Why?
 Because she's great in everything.

Now, where were we? Oh, yes.
Does anyone have any wood?


Come on. I just want wood.
Why are you making it so hard?



So do they have a name for a first date
with someone you used to go out with?

That's a good question.
How about "awkward"?

 Yeah, that sounds right.
 Yeah? Heh, heh.

How about if we pretend we're actually
on a first date? See how that goes.

Okay.

So, Polly, tell me about yourself.

 Heh, heh. It's Penny.
 Oh, sorry. Yeah. Awkward.


Okay, let's see. I'm from Nebraska,
and ever since I was a little girl...

I dreamed of moving to L.A.
and becoming a movie star.

Anyway, after four years
of acting lessons and waiting tables...

I've done a hemorrhoid
commercial...

and a production of Anne Frank
above a bowling alley.

So you know, dreams do come true.

 Your turn.
 Uh, let's see. Ahem. Uh...

I am an experimental physicist
at Caltech.

Most of my research
is with high-powered lasers, and...

Oh, I've just gotten
a big government grant...

to see if they can be used
to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.

 Wow. Can they?
 Oh, God, no.


But the money's pretty good.

And I used the equipment
to make my own Bat-Signal.


Bat-Signal?
What are you, some kind of nerd?

Not some kind of nerd,
I am the king of nerds.


 What does that mean?
 It means if anyone displeases me...

I don't help them set up their printer.


You are so funny.

Good. Remember that
when I take my shirt off.

 This is nice. I'm so glad we did this.
 Me too.

So, what do you think,
are we gonna get back together?

Whoa, not so fast.

I'm sorry, what did I say?

Leonard, you know I will always
have feelings for you...

 Oh, God.
 What?

You said "always."
You'll always have feelings for me.

 So?
 That sounds like something you'd say...

if you didn't want a relationship
with someone.

"This isn't working out,
but I'll always have feelings for you."

"I'm sorry I slept with your best friend,
but I'll always have feelings for you."

"Here's the thing, Lisa,
I'm into dudes now...

but I'll always have feelings
for you."

 How would you say it?
 I have feelings for you.

 Same thing.
 No, it's not. "Always" made it worse.

 You're over-thinking this.
 No, I'm not.

 You always over-think things.
 There you go. "Always" made it worse.

See, this is where everything
goes wrong, when we talk.

Well, I don't know how you have
a relationship without talking.

I went out with T.J. for eight months.
We never talked.

To this day, I don't even know
what T.J. stands for.

Wait, if you guys didn't talk...?
Never mind, stupid question.

And now that I have some wood...

I'm going to begin the erection
of my settlement.

He's got to be doing this on purpose.

Ooh, eight-thirty. You and Penny decide
to go out and paint the town beige?

You're 30 years old
and you live with your mother.

I guess it didn't go well.

We don't know that. Not to a certainty.

All we know is that Leonard is home.


How about now?

Again, not enough evidence.
For all we know, he's being murdered.

Now, back to our game.

You were in the middle of an erection.


Oh, of course.
It's right here in my hand.


What does she want from me now?

 What's up?
 Do not over-think this.

 I don't understand...
 Bup, bup, bup.

 Okay, but earlier it seemed like...
 No talking.

Because sometimes I have questions.


Well, that was fun.

Yeah. Except for when
I got the foot cramp.

You hung in there though.

There was a lot at stake.

So, what do you wanna do now?

Well, I wanna go get my asthma inhaler,
but it might ruin the moment.

So help me out, here.
How does a miserable date end in sex?

I don't know, it's complicated.

I'm pretty smart guy, and right now my
brain has dibs on the blood supply...

so give it a go.

Okay. It's just...

At that restaurant when you said
you wanted us to be together again...

it got very real, very fast
and I panicked.

Why? What are you afraid of?

Well, what if we do go out and I do
something stupid and dump you again?

What if I dump you?


Come on, be serious.

Well, how about if we don't think
about this as a relationship?

It could be more like
a new version of software.

Penny and Leonard 2.0.

We can test it internally,
shake out the bugs...

and if we both feel it's solid,
then we'll roll it out to the public.

We don't tell people
we're back together?

Exactly.
We pretend like our date went badly.

Well, we don't really have to pretend.

And we let them think that we decided
to just be friends...

and that everything's cool.

Okay. Great.

Hey, I just remembered.
I still got one of your inhalers.

I can't believe you kept this.

I was gonna throw it away,
but I just couldn't.

That is so sweet.

Heh.

In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you
how much this means to me.

 Leonard?
 Yeah, hi.

How's it going?

Can't complain, thanks for asking.

What were you doing out
at 3:00 in the morning?

Well... What are you doing up?

I was using the bathroom.

Yeah, well, so was I.

Really? I didn't see you in there.

Obviously.

When I saw that you were in ours,
I went and used another one.

Where?

Uh, the gas station across the street.

 In your pajamas?
 Yes.

Without shoes?

Yes.

On a cold winter's night?

Yes.

That seems unlikely.
Did you bring your asthma inhaler?

Uh, uh, yes, I did.

Well, then I guess it's plausible.

 Hang on a second, mister.
 What?

After you used the facilities at the gas
station, did you make a purchase?

What?

It's customary when using the restroom
at a retail establishment...

to make a small purchase. Did you?

No.

Here's $2.

Go buy some beef jerky.

I don't want beef jerky.

It's not about you.

It's about a poor immigrant
from Pakistan...

trying to make his way in America
by working the graveyard shift...

at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.

Fine.

Needy baby, greedy baby, indeed.

Leonard will be here in a moment.

He's looking for
a different parking space.

 Why?
 We were next to a car with an...

"ask me about my grandchildren"
bumper sticker...

and I was afraid if we ran into them
on the way out, I'd be obligated to do so.

I'm so disappointed
it didn't work with him and Penny.

Me too. Out of deference to them,
let's not flaunt our happy relationship.

You have a keen insight into
the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.

We are next to a Subaru
with a Gore-Lieberman bumper sticker.

Well, I doubt they'd wanna
talk about that, so we're fine.

I'm surprised to see you here
after it went so badly with Penny.

Well, hey, we're grown-ups.
We can still be friends.

Boy, I don't know if I could be friends
with Howie if we broke up.

 Why not?
 I'm a very vengeful person.

 Really?
 With access to weaponized smallpox.

Let me get you some water. You need
menus, or you know what you want?

Leonard knows what he wants, but it
looks like he's not gonna get it from you.

 Howard.
 No, that's okay, Bernadette.

Sometimes these things
just don't work out.

Yeah. It's all good. We'll always
have feelings for each other.

Oh. That's nice.

See? She knew what "always" meant.

Wow, you're like a dog with a bone,
aren't you?

 I'm just making a point.
 Is the point you don't know...

 ...when to let something go?
 People, people, please.

Before you say something
you both regret...

I'd like to place my order.

Yeah, hang on, Sheldon.
You know why we can't be together?

 Because you always have to be right.
 That is not true.

I gotta go with Leonard on this.
He is wrong more than anyone I know.

You know what, I just realized
I'm on a break. I'll get someone else.

Promise me
when our new waitress comes over...

you will not start a complicated,
on-again, off-again relationship with her.

Because I'm very, very hungry.


Unbelievable.

Mind explaining why you were being
a jerk at the restaurant?

I was trying to act like we weren't
seeing each other. That was the plan.

The plan was to tell people
we decided to stay friends.

But that's a little hard to do when
you're always being such a toolbag.

I don't have to stand here
and take this crap.

Where do you think you're going?

Isn't sex after fighting
kind of what we do now?

Yeah, kind of, yeah.

 What are we doing?
 What do you mean?

Every scenario I play out
for you and me ends badly.

Because you over-think everything.

Leonard, are you listening to me?

 What? Yeah.
 This is a disaster.

I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy
Mr. Spock cardboard standee.

Why would I feel safer with
Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?

I don't know.
He was pretty badass on Heroes.

You're right. I'll give him a shot.

Hang on.

 Penny, you have plans for dinner?
 You guys going somewhere?

No, I mean just you and me.

Ooh.

Have you thought this through?

Yes. And I think we should go anyway.

No, can't do it.
Sorry, Quinto, you're going back.

If you and Leonard get back together,
Sheldon and I will finally have...

 ...someone to go on double dates with.
 What about me and Howard?

Fine, we can double with you too.

So insecure.

Where are you guys going to eat?

Penny?

Do you, Penny, take Leonard
to be your lawful wedded husband?

Well, it's a little late for me
to start saying "no," isn't it?

Penny?

Sorry. I just remembered
I've got to stop by the drugstore.



Time!

All right, Klingons, pencils down.

Okay, I have "pokh."

Have it. Got it.

"Potl."

Yup. Have it. Have it.

"Pukhpa."

Have it. Got it. Yup.

I have "chorrr."

Got it. Yup.

"Nekhmakh." -Yeah. Yeah.

And "kreplach."

Hold on a second. "Kreplach?"

Yeah.

That isn't Klingon; it's Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.

Well, as it turns out, it's also a Klingon word.

Really? Define it.

"Kreplach": A hearty Klingon... dumpling.

Judge's ruling?

Bilurrrbe.

Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.

What's wrong with your TV?

I don't know. It just died.

I'm getting a bunch of static.

Did you pay your cable bill?

Ugh, you sound just like the cable company.

All right, so, shh!

Tyra Banks is about to kick

someone off  America's Next Top Model.

Excuse me, Penny, but we're...

No, no, don't tell her.

playing Klingon Boggle.

Aw...

What do you mean, "Aw"?

Like she didn't know we were nerds?

All right, if you must watch,

then mute it with closed captions, please.

Fine.

All right, Boggle warriors... kapla'!

Look at those women.

They're gorgeous.

Oh! "Worf," nice! Too bad that's a proper noun.

Oh, look, the's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

No, wait, that's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

With her head in the lap of...

Oh, what a coincidence. It's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother.

The current Mrs. Wolowitz.

Is "qochbe'" spelled with a (gargling) or a (guttural grunt)?

Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?

That's Anais.

None of the other girls in the house like her.

House? What house?

They all live in a house together.

A house, where?

I don't know. Somewhere in L.A.

Wait a minute.

You're telling me that I'm within driving distance

of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?

Yeah, I guess.

And they live together and shower together and...

have naked pillow fights?

Hey, wh-where are you going?

To pay my cable bill.

All right, pencils down!

I have "lokh," "makh," and "cherrrkh."

Anybody got those?

Did I miss anything?

Did they kick Giselle off?

Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot

was an embarrassment.

Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine.

Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.

Sheldon, the food's here.

Ooh, there's the house.

Freeze frame, freeze frame.

What are you doing?

Marking the star positions and physical landmarks

so we can find the house of the supermodels.

Why?

Isn't it obvious?

Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl,

making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem.

A.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.

Is my hamburger medium well? -Yes.

Dill slices, not sweet? -Yes.

Individual relish packets? -Yes.

Onion rings? -Yes.

Extra breading? -I asked.

What did they say? -No. -Did you protest?

Yes. -Vociferously? -No.

Well, then what took you so long?

Just eat.

Hey, guys, what'd I miss? What'd I miss?

Giselle's hanging by a thread.

Oh, good, I hate her.

Then you're not invited to our wedding.

Here you go.

Thank you.

Oh, do we have to suffer through this

transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?

Yes.

You and I have a standing TV schedule,

which is the result of extensive debate and compromise.

Any alterations except for breaking news

have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.

Put it on the agenda.

But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.

Oh, I'll make a motion, but you're not going to like it.

Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure.

At least put it on mute.

Oh, Giselle's not getting kicked off.

It's totally going to be Summer.

What?

Sheldon's onion ring. Just put it back!

It's one onion ring.

Just put it back before he comes!

No, no, no!

No, I don't think that's where it was.

Okay, here he comes.  Deny, deny, people.

Wall of silence.

Who touched my...

Penny! Penny did it.

Why would you do that?

I don't know. I was hungry?

What's the big deal?

The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.

All right. Look, I didn't know, I'm sorry.

Well, I'm sorry, but that is your second strike.

What?

You have two strikes.

Three strikes and you're out.

It's a sports metaphor.

A sports metaphor?

Yes, baseball.

All right, yeah. I-I'll play along.

What was my first strike?

March 18th.

You violated my rule about forwarding email humor.

I did?

The photo of the cat who wants to "has cheezeburger"?

Oh, come on. Everybody loves "LOL cats."

They're cute and they can't spell 'cause they're cats.

I trusted you with my email address,

and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality:

strike one.

Touching my food: strike two.

Don't worry. They only stay on your record for a year.

You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.

Come on, I touched one onion ring.

Yeah, and then you put it back,

compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.

Oh, honey, the buses don't go where you live, do they?

Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you,

but since you've become a permanent member of our social group,

I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.

Congratulations. You're officially one of us.

One of us, one of us.

Well, what a thrill.

You're sitting in my spot.

Oh, jeez, you've got to be kidding me.

Leonard, she's in my spot.

Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here's the thing.

After you leave, I still have to live with him.

I don't care. I'm taking a stand.

Metaphorically.

All right, that's it. Strike three.

Ooh, strike three.

I'm banished?

What the hell kind of crap is that?

Listen, don't worry. I'll talk to him.

Yeah, you do that.

Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class?

You can do it online!

So based on our triangulation,

we've narrowed down the location of the Top Model house

to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.

Or possibly Durham, Noh Carolina.

When we find it, you want to go with us?

To do what?

Party with the pretty girls, dude!

Are you insane?

You're not going to party with them.

You're not even going to get anywhere near that place.

That's what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.

No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong.

The entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure

to put a man on the moon.

Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out,

we will put a Wolowitz on one of America's top models.

And a large number of people will believe it never happened.

Okay, let me guess.

A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.

Thank you.

Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds

for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard.

And for our suddenly "back on the Hindu wagon" Raj,

the meatlover's pizza, no meat.

Coming right up.

Wait. Excuse me.

You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger,

barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.

Oh, I didn't tell you?

You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.

Why?

Well, you have three strikes.

One: coming in. Two: sitting down.

And three: I don't like your attitude.

You can't do that.

Not only is it a violation of California state law,

it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.

Yeah, no, there's a new policy:

No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.

I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.

Penny, can I talk to you for a minute?

Well, here's the thing.

Um, I talked to Sheldon

and he feels terrible

and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.

Really? Well, that's great.

Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?

What? I'm not going to apologize to that nutcase.

Oh, come on. It's easy.

He'll even tell you what to say.

Leard, don't you get it?

If you guys keep going along with his insanity,

you're just encouraging him.

We're not encouraging.

It's more like... knuckling under.

Look, I like hanging out with you guys,

but I'm not going to apologize for something I didn't do.

Well, actually, technically, you did do it.

That's strike one, Leonard.

There you go: quesadilla.

Salad.

There's your pizza.

And thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion

with my manager

one barbecue bacon cheeseburger,

barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.

Thank you.

Go ahead. Eat it.

I dare you

That's it. There's the house.

I foundAmerica's top models!

Are you sure?

Look, on the roof.

Anais and Giselle are sunbathing.

European-style.

You can recognize people on Google Earth?

Of course not.

I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.

NORAD? You're using military aircraft?

It was already targeted to poke around

a nuclear reactor in Siberia.

I took it an hour out of its way, tops.

Okay, where is he?

Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?

Here. Try and go online.

Problem with the WiFi? Just try.

Greetings, hamburger toucher.

You are probably wondering

why you cannot IM with your little friends

about how much you "heart" various things.

This recorded message is alerting you

that I am putting an end

to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi.

If you want to remedy the situation,

you can contact the phone company,

set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.

Well?

I reiterate: knuckle under.

No, no, no, no, no. It is on.

I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.

Oh, Penny, you don't want to get into it

with Sheldon.

The guy is one lab accident away

from being a supervillain.

I don't care. I was in junior rodeo.

I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.

No need to neuter the nerd.

I can get you back online.

There, see? Problem solved.

Voil?

SHELDON: Hello, puny insects.

As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will,

everyone is awarded one additional strike.

Thanks a lot, Howard.

What are you complaining about?

I'm the one who has to take the class again.

Hello.

Time to do your laundry, huh?

It's Saturday night.

Saturday is laundry night.

I know.

Every Saturday at 8:15.

Easy to anticipate.

What are you implying?

I'm implying that you're a creature of habit.

And if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry

on Saturday at 8:15,

you might find it...

unpleasant.

Knuckle under? My ass.

Oh, no, are all the machines taken?

What are you gonna do?

No problem.

I'll just do my laundry another night.

Another night?

Well, I guess you can try,

but deep inside your heart,

you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.

Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.

Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.

Sheldon. Sheldon!

Sheldon.

Yes?

Where are my clothes?

Your clothes? Yes, I left them in the washers

and when I went down to get them, they were gone.

Really?

Despite the sign that says "Do not leave laundry unattended"?

Sheldon, where are my clothes?

You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments.

Where was that?

Oh, yes...

Earlier this evening,

I happened to gaze out the window

and a brassiere caught my eye.

Do those look familiar?

How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?

When you understand the laws of physics, Penny,

anything is possible.

And may I add: mwuh-ha-ha.

Get them down.

Apologize. Never.

Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick

and play panty pinata.

Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay?

I've done some stupid things.

You've done some stupid things.

How about we just call it even and move on with our lives?

I've done no stupid things.

Look, you've got to meet me halfway here.

I am meeting you halfway.

I'm willing to concede that you've done stupid things.

Hey, you guys are talking again. Good.

What happened?

Leonard, remember when I said it was on?

Well, now it's junior rodeo on.

Oh, not junior rodeo.

What did you do?

I had no choice, Leonard.

She ruined laundry night.

Mwuh-ha-ha.

Telephone wires can't electrocute you, can they?

No. Look, this has to stop.

Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.

All right, I really didn't want to do this, but...

here.

What's this?

Sheldon's Kryptonite.

Oh, my God.

He can never know that I gave that to you.

Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but...

but this?

It'll shorten the war by five years

and save millions of lives.

Oh, pause it. That's it. Confirmed.

We now have the address of the Top Model house.

God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.

Okay, for the record,

what you're doing is really creepy.

You know what? If it's "creepy"

to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft

to find a house full of gorgeous young models

so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly,

then fine, I'm "creepy."

Hello.

Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I'll get him.

Sheldon, it's for you.

Who is it? Your mother.

Oh, good.

Hi, Mom. How are you?

But, Mom...

she keeps sitting in my spot.

And-and she touched my food.

Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it...

No, that's not fair.

Why should I have to apologize?

Yeah, I really don't think this is the kind of thing

Jesus concerns himself with.

No, you're right.

I don't really know what Jesus thinks about.

All right, good-bye.

Did you tell on me?

Are you kidding me?

I already have two strikes.

Penny. Penny.

Penny.

I am very, very sorry for what I have done.

Here's your laundry.

I rescind your strikes

and you are no longer banished.

Can I sit wherever I want?

Never mind, never mind.

That's, that's not important.

Sheldon, this was big of you.

Thank you. I really appreciate it.

Thank you.

Good night, Sheldon.

Penny...

Yes?

Well played.

Thank you.

Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.

Understood.

Can I help you

Yes, we here to fix the cable.

I think we have satellite.

That's what I meant.

Oh. Okay, come on in.

She's taller than all the women in my family combined.

What do we do now?

Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.


Penny, hello.

Hey, sheldon.

What is shaking?

I'm sorry?

It's colloquial, a conversation opener.

So, do you find the weather satisfying?

Are you currently sharing in the triumph

of some local sports team?

What's wrong with you? you're freaking me out.

I'm striking up a casual conversation with you.

S'up?

Please don't do that.

All right,

But I'm given to understand that

when you have something awkward to discuss with someone,

it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.

So, this wasn't the awkward part?

No.

Oh, all right.

S'up?

Oh, good, I used that right.

Anyway,

You're aware that leonard has entered into a new

Romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?

Okay, feeling the awkward now.

Her name is

dr.Stephanie barnett and she is a highly

Distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial.

Yeah, leonard told me. good.

What he may have left out is

how important this relationship is to me.

To you?

Yes, see, of the handful of women leonard's been involved with,

She's the only one I have ever found tolerable.

Well, what about me?

The statement stands for itself.

Well, aren't you sweet?

Anyway, should you have any interaction with her,

It would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.

Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.

You say that now, but consider the following senario

you're sitting in your apartment,

It's late, you're alone.

Your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and

Progesterone and suddenly even

Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate.

Or a, uh, "hookup"

As it's referred to by today's urban youth.

Really? yes.

Now, should that happen,

I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.

I could think about you.

Fine, whatever works.

Always nice talking to you, sheldon.

Uh, peace out!

Well, this is very pleasant.

Glad you're enjoying yourself.

And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us.

I stand corrected.

You know, italian housewives have a rule of thumb.

A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is

Sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.

That's very interesting.

Thank you.

She doesn't mean it. she's just being nice.

Well, stephanie,

Since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball,

I guess I'll just have to pick it up.

Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?

No. good.

What's your favorite fruit?

Uh, strawberries.

Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right.

Where did you do your medical internship?

Uh, lawrence memorial in galveston, texas.

Really? that's where I was born!

You're kidding!

I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital.

When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.

Why, w-w-what happened?

Radiation burns.

A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.

I'm sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?

No, I didn't try, I succeeded.

In fact, I was briefly able to see

the inside of my sister's guinea pig,

Snowball, before he caught fire.

It led to an interesting

"not a snowball's chance in a cat scanner."

Uh, sheldon?

Excuse me.

When I come back,just for fun,

the subject will be alternative history.

Specifically,

How would the civil war have gone differently

If lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?

Look at that, there's even pasta left over.

Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?

I do.

Do you? because frankly,

you've been in a foul mood since I sat down.

Okay, here's my question. why did you sit down?

To help.

Look, if you fail at this relationship,

and history suggests you will,

Then we risk losing the medical officer

That our landing party has always needed.

What landing party?

You're kirk, I'm spock, wolowitz is scotty,

Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed...

And now we've got mccoy.

So,

We're all standing around looking at the post-op x ray

and there it is,

Clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity...

One of my earrings.

Oh, my god, what did you do?

What do you think I did?

I discreetly slipped off the other earring,

Put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!

I have a bone to pick with you, sir.

Hi, sheldon.

Hi, stephanie.

I'm sorry I'm late,

But yourompanion left the most indecipherable invitation.

What invitation?

"we're going to the movies."

What movie? what theater? what time?

If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you,

You couldn't have done a better job.

Oh, clearly I could have.

It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser

History on your computer to see what movie times you looked up.

Wait here, I'll find us seats.

Uh, no, we have seats.

Not the right seats.

What is he doing?

He's finding the acoustic sweet spot.

Does he always do this?

Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone.

I am really sorry about this.

No, it's fine. you know, he's sweet.

My apologies, you've been sitting in it all along.

Leonard, you want to slide over one?

No, just sit here.

Oh, yeah, this is it.

Leonard.

Leonard? leonard?!

What, sheldon?

What, sheldon?! what, sheldon?!

Tell me what you see here.

The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?

This is stephanie's facebook page.

Now, where it should say "in a relationship," what does it say?

"stephanie barnett is single."

Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening,

She threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike.

Who's mike?!

Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?

It's just her facebook page and we've

Only been going out a couple of weeks.

You don't see it, do you?

We're losing her.

Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you.

You are not in this relationship.

I am.

Ergo, you have no say in anything

that happens between me and stephanie.

I'm afraid I can't allow that.

Pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a,

You are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.

General order 104, section a does not apply in this situation.

Give me one good reason why not.

Because this is not startrek

Penny?

Penny? penny?!

What?

This is banana bread.

This is a door knob.

It's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can

Be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.

Sheldon, would you like to come in?

I suppose I could spare a few minutes.

Were you robbed?

No.

How can you be sure?

Sheldon, what do you want?

I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you,

But leonard is failing in yet another relationship.

He's having problems with stephanie?

She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet.

If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data.

Specifically,

I need to know exactly what leonard did that

Caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.

What?

Again, urban slang.

In which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency.

So, what is the "down" and the "low"?

And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so,

You feel free to include

any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.

We never got to the bedroom.

Because?

Oh, okay, all right, you know what?

I'll tell you what happened.

We were young, we were very much in love,

But we could only communicate through a

Time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.

It's not enough that you made me watch that movie,

But now you mock me with it?

Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.

You told me you were going to have the talk with him.

I've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.

More to the point,

It's about finding a way to keep leonard and stephanie together.

Oh, I don't think you can.

Well, why not?

Look at leonard's record.

27 days with joyce kim.

During which she defected to north korea.

Two booty calls with leslie winkle.

For which she awarded him the nickname "speed of light leonard."

And the three hour dinner with penny.

Which would have been two and a half if

They ordered the souffle when they sat down.

Based on the geometric progression,

His relationship with stephanie

should have ended after 20 minutes.

Yes, I'm aware of the math.

Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth.

The issue remains.

How do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?

Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to stephanie,

Your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.

I'll tell you what you shouldn't do.

Don't shpritz him with that body spray from the

Commercial where the women undress when they smell it.

That doesn't work at all.

No matter how much you put on.

So, that's all you've got?

Apocalyptic genocide and "go easy on the cologne"?

Yeah. yes.

Penny.

Penny?

What?

Penny?

Zucchini bread.

Oh, thank you.

May I come in?

No.

I see.

Apparently,

My earlier inquiry regarding

you and leonard crossed some sort of line.

I apologize.

Well, thank you.

So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?

Yes. great.

New topic.

Where are you in your menstrual cycle?

What?!

I've been doing some research online,

and apparently female primates,

You know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you.

They find their mate more desirable

When he's being courted by another female.

Now, This effect is intensified when the rival female

Is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation.

Which brings me back to my question.

Where are you in your--

Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.

All I'm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria,

Why can't they do something about lactose intolerance?

Leonard, you're going to have to let this go.

You had a little cheese dip, you farted.

I thought it was cute.

Oh, hi, stephanie.

Wanna more wine?

Yeah, I'm not driving anywhere tonight.

What are you doing?

I have a craving for white asparagus

That apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.

Excuse me.

What the hell is wrong with you?

I'm helping you with stephanie.

By making constipated moose sounds?

When I fail to open this jar and you succeed,

It will establish you as the "alpha" male.

You see...

When a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination,

She produces the hormone oxytocin.

If the two of you then engage in intercourse,

This will create the biochemical reaction in the brain

Which lay people naively interpret as "falling in love."

Would it work if I just punched you in the face?

Yes, actually it would, but let's see how the lid goes.

I'm not strong enough, leonard, you'll have to do it.

Oh, for god's sakes.

Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.

Do you want some help with that?

No, no, no, I got it.

No, yeah, yeah, he's got it, and that's not surprising.

This is something I long ago came to

Peace with in my role as the beta male.

Open it.

 Oh, my god, are you okay? - no, I'm not.

I'm bleeding.

Like a gladiator!

Oh, honey, you're going to need stitches.

Stitches? with a needle?

Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.

Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.

Fyi, I was defrosting a steak in there.

What a beautiful job stephanie did.

I might have gone with a mattress suture

instead of a blanket stitch,

But you can't argue with her results.

It's a shame it won't scar.

The war wound is a time-honored badge of masculinity.

I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.

Just for the record,

My efforts to establish you as the alpha

Male were not aided by you bursting into tears.

I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.

Watery?

She stuck a needle into my hand!

Hey, how's my big cry baby?

I didn't cry.

Okay, I'm just teasing you.

But, yeah, you did.

Okay, it's all good.

What do you say we get you home and put you to bed?

Oh, are you still going to spend the night?

Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.

She's right. as long as you're vomiting,

coitus is contra-indicated.

Thank you, dr. cooper.

You're welcome, dr. hofstadter.

Okay, I'm going to go get your discharge papers.

What?

Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person.

I can't understand why women have such a hard time loving you.

Hey, can you open this for me?

Can I see your stitches?

Sure.

Answering the question once and for all

Why wolowitz bailed out of medical school.

Leonard, congratulations.

What for?

Your facebook status update.

Leonard hofstadter is "in a relationship."

What? no. no, that's not right.

Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did?

Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.

Seriously?

You went first, after only two weeks?

That's bold...

It's not bold, it's a mistake.

I didn't change my status.

Well, then who did?

I had no choice. he cried in front of her.

You hacked my facebook account?

Oh, it's hardly hacking

when you use the same password for everything,

"kal-el."

Are you insane?

Now she's going to think I'm desperate.

You've destroyed this relationship!

And you want to know what the worst part is?

You don't even understand what you did wrong because you

Can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in!

In which I am not an expert.

Don't even!

I don't want to hear another word out of you.

What's wrong, lassie? timmy fall down the well?

She just updated her facebook status.

"stephanie barnett is in a relationship

with leonard hofstadter."

Really?

Oh, look at that.

I have a girlfriend.

If I am permitted to speak again,

dr. sheldon cooper for the win.



I'm telling you, if xenon emits
ultraviolet light,

then those dark matter
discoveries must be wrong.

Yes, well, if we lived
in a world

where slow-moving xenon
produced light,

then you'd be correct.

Also, pigs would fly,

my derriere would produce
cotton candy,

and The Phantom Menace
would be a timeless classic.

Oh, you're so arrogant.

If you were a superhero,

your name would be
Captain Arrogant.

And you know
what your superpower would be?

Arrogance.

You're wrong again.

If my superpower were arrogance,
my name would be Dr. Arroganto.

I love watching Raj and Sheldon
try to work together.

Yeah, it's like
if Alien and Predator decided

to go partners
in a Jamba Juice.

Has it occurred to you
you're missing the big picture?

If you look at neutron
scattering data...
Oh, Penny?

Penny?
What's up?

Nothing. I just wanted

to make Raj stop talking.

No, no, no.

He won. Suck it up.

Well, I'd ask you guys
if you want dessert,

but I know Sheldon doesn't
eat dessert on Tuesdays.

And even if Raj wanted
something, he couldn't tell me.

Howard won't order anything,

but he will come up
with some sort of skeevy comment

involving the words pie
or cheesecake.

And Leonard's
lactose intolerant,

so he can't eat anything here

without his intestines
blowing up

like a balloon animal.

Hang on a second.

I could have the fruit platter.

You want the fruit platter?

Does it have melon
on it?
Yeah.

No, I can't eat melon.

Oh, Howard,
heads up.

Your ex-girlfriend just
came in for her shift.

When was the last time
you saw her?

Oh, not since we broke up.

Wow. How am I going
to play this?

Sophisticated and relaxed?

Friendly, noncommittal?

Cold and distant?

Hi, guys.
Hey.

Hello.

I see you decided to go
with pathetic and frightened.

It's one of his best moves.

 


So, my dear, we meet again.

Hello, Howard.

I've missed you.

I've missed you,
Katee Sackhoff.

One question.
Anything.

Why am I wearing my
Battlestar Galactica
flight suit in bed?

Why are you in bed with me?

If we start to question this,
it all falls apart.

Sorry.

Oh, ravish
me, Howard.

My loins
ache for you.

Okay, if you insist.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, have you seen

my girdle?!

No, Ma!

I can't find it, and I'm late
for my Weight Watchers meeting!

Maybe it committed suicide!

Leave me alone!

Now, where were we?

I believe you
were about

to rip off my uniform
with your teeth.

Bernadette?!

What are you doing here?

Well, if I had to
guess, I'd say I'm here

because you saw me
earlier this evening,

and you're still
hung up on me.

No, I'm not.

Clearly you are.

Otherwise, based
on past experience,

we'd be done by now.

Okay,
I'm a little confused here.

GEORGE TAKEI:
Oh, my.

Can I help?

Not that kind of confused.

What's George
Takei doing here?

Howard, do you have
latent homosexual tendencies?

No, of course not.

So you say.

Yet, here I am.

George, let me
ask you something.

How did you deal
with being typecast

as a science fiction icon?

It's difficult.

You try and stretch
as an actor--

do Strindberg, O'Neill,

but all they want is,
"Course laid in, Captain."

Tell me about it.

It's frackin'
frustrating.

Wait. Katee,
why are you leaving?

She's leaving because you
really want to be with me.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, I found my girdle!

It was in the dryer!

Great, Ma!

I think it shrunk!

I'm spilling out like
the Pillsbury Doughboy here!

And with that mental picture,

I think we're done
for the evening.

You know, you never
told me what happened

between you
and Bernadette.

I did a stupid thing.

Yeah, I guessed that.

It was the kind of thing

that makes it kind of hard
to face her now.

That covers anything
from farting in bed

to killing a homeless guy.

Oh, my God.

You ran over a hobo.

No. Stop asking.

All right, fine. So you want to
get back together with her,

but you're too
ashamed to face her

because of whatever
it is you did.

In a nutshell.
Okay.

Well, how about this?

Kidnap Bernadette from the opera

wearing a creepy mask so
she doesn't know it's you.

Now, you see, I don't know
if you're kidding or not.

You're being
unreasonable.

Why can't
I have a desk?!

Our collaboration is a work
of the mind.

We don't need desks.

You have a desk.

Correct.
But I can't have one.

You're two for two.

Why can't he have a desk,
Sheldon?

Oh, Lord, will
this day never end?

As I've explained repeatedly
to Dr. Koothrappali,

whose ability to comprehend
the American idiom fails him

when it's convenient,

there's absolutely
no money

in my budget for
additional office furniture.

Oh, but there's money
for a drawer full of Red Vines,

a marshmallow shooting rifle,

and a super executive ant farm
with glow-in-the-dark sand?

Yes.

Okay, what if he
buys his own desk?

Yeah, what
if I buy my own desk?

That's ridiculous.
Why?

Because...

Yes?

It's my office.

Sheldon.
All right, all right.

He can buy his own desk.

And I can put it in your office?

Well, you really want

to dot the I's and cross
the T's, don't you?

Why would you want
a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?

They do some
of their best work at night.

Ah, it's okay.

Penny?

Penny?

Penny?

Penny?

Would you have opened the door
if you knew it was me?

Not since I found out

the teddy bear you gave me
had a webcam in it.

I just have a question.

Does Bernadette
ever talk about me?

Oh, absolutely.

She does?
Yeah, sure.

Just yesterday, she asked,

"Why is Howard hiding
under the table?"

She saw that, huh?

Oh, no, not at first.

Right after I pointed it out.

Let me ask you something else.

Is she seeing anybody?

Oh, not that I know of.

Hey, while
we're on the subject,

why did you guys break up
anyway?

Oh, I'd rather not say.

Howard, if you want my help,
I've got to know what happened.

But it's embarrassing...

Yeah, that's what
I'm counting on. Spill.

Okay. Well, you know
World of Warcraft?

Um, the online game? Sure.

Well, did you know

that the characters in the game
can have sex with each other?

Oh, God. I think
I see where this is going.

Her name was
Glissinda the Troll.

Bernadette walked in on me

while we were doing
the cyber-nasty

under the Bridge of Souls.

Oh, you're right.

That is so embarrassing.

Would you talk to her?

Bernadette or the troll?

Bernadette. She
was so mad at me,

she wouldn't even listen
to my side of the story.

Well, what was your side?

Well, for all we know,

Glissinda the Troll
wasn't even a real woman.

I mean, she could've been
a 50-year-old truck driver

in New Jersey.

Really? And that didn't
make her feel better?

Will you talk to her, see
if there's any chance at all

we could get back together?

Oh, gee, Howard,
I really don't want

to get in the middle of this.

No. Why would you?

I'm just another lonely
nerd, living with his mother,

trying to find any scrap
of happiness he can.

You know, maybe to make up
for the fact that his dad

left him when
he was 11.

Okay, I will think about it.

You know, I've always
blamed myself

for him leaving.

I always thought it was because
I wasn't the son he wanted.

Yeah, I said I'd
think about it.

I wasn't athletic,
yeah, I was kind of sickly...

Okay, fine. Look, look,
I'm calling her now! See?!

Thank you.

So anyway,
Howard asked Penny

to talk to Bernadette,
and she did,

and Bernadette agreed to meet
him for a cup of coffee.

One question.
Yeah?

Why on earth
are you telling me all this?

I don't know.

Sometimes your movements
are so lifelike,

I forget you're
not a real boy.

You said I could
buy a desk.

This isn't a desk.

This is a...
Brobdingnagian
monstrosity.

Is that the American idiom

for "giant, big-ass desk"?

It's actually British.

Can you say it again for me?

Brobdingnagian.

One more time?

Brobdingnagian.

Now three times fast?

Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna...

How did you even
get it in here?

That's for me, Ramon, Julio,
Jesus and Rodrigo to know

and you to find out.

All right, you've
made your point.

A fine prank, very amusing.

Now get it out.

No.

Yes.

Yes.
No.

Yes!
I have three brothers

and two sisters, Sheldon--
I can do this all day.

All right, if you're
not going to remove it,

I'll remove it for you.

Knock yourself out.

Help me move my desk.

No.
Yes.

No.
Yes.

No. It's too Brobdingnagian.

Why do you even want this here?

Its size is completely
disproportionate
to its purpose.

Well, seeing as its purpose
was to piss you off,

I'd say it's spot-on.

All right, I see
what's going on.

This is the opening
salvo in what will be

an escalating series of
juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges.

Well titted.

Thank you.

Stand by for my upcoming tat.

Hey, Sheldon?

Yes?

No.

See what I did there?
I turned it around.

Sorry,

I had to clock out.

Oh, no, that's okay.

How have you been?

Okay. You know,
busy, schoolwork. You?

Same. I took a scuba-diving
course over the summer,

but it turns out I'm
terrified of the ocean.

Too bad.

You wouldn't know anybody
who wants to buy a wet
suit, boy's large?

Yeah, forget it.
Not important.

So, are you
seeing anyone?

Well, to be honest, I...
Hey, how are we

doing over here? Can I
get you something to drink?

Not for me, thanks.
I'm okay.

Are you gonna want
to order food?

Maybe later.
Okay.

So, are you seeing anybody?

No.

That's what I told him
when he asked me.

I hope that's not out of line.

No, it's fine.
Penny, can we have
a little privacy?

Oh. I'm sorry.

What about you,
have you been seeing anybody?

Well, you know
how it is with guys.

I mean, we have needs and...

So you've been seeing
other girls?

Well, not real girls.

Does that mean slutty trolls?

You know, you look thirsty.

I brought you some iced tea.
Thank you.

It's passion fruit,
new on the menu.

I know. I work here.
Oh, sorry.

Yeah, you're right. Doy.

So, Howard,

yay or nay?

Isn't there somewhere else
you can be?

Not where I can hear you guys.

Okay, fine.

I'll admit, there are dark,
sordid little corners

of the Internet
where the name Wolowizard

is whispered in hushed tones.

The only reason I go there,

the only reason
I've ever gone there

is because I don't have
a real woman in my life.

You happy?
Yeah, that'll hold me
for a while.

Howard, you did have
a real woman.

I was right there
in the next room

while you were clicking
that troll's brains out.

Yeah, but we
weren't...

I-I mean, you
and I never...

Had sex?

Yeah.

Well, whose fault was that?

Complimentary nachos!

You enjoy.

Never had sex? Wow.

What do you mean,
whose fault was that?

Well, we could've
been having sex,

but you never made the move.

I didn't think you wanted me
to make the move.

Howard, a girl doesn't go out
with a man like you,

with your looks,
your fancy patter

and your tight hoochie pants
if she's not expecting him

to eventually make the move.

Really?

Really.

Son of a bitch.

Hey, this is a little awkward,
but my manager says

I can't actually
give nachos away.

So... just take that
when you're ready.

Yeah, we had
a really great talk,

and we're gonna start
seeing each other again.

Oh, congratulations.

Have you broken it
to the troll yet?

Did Penny tell you about that?

No. Steve Patterson told me.

The greasy old fat guy
in Facilities Management?

Yeah.
How'd he know about it?

He's Glissinda the troll.

Sorry, dude,

the thermostat's
on my side of the room,

so it stays Mumbai hot
in here until you turn off
that stupid Indian music!

I'll turn off the music

when you get rid of that
salmonella-ridden parakeet!

Oh, too bad! Sheldon's
pathologically
afraid of birds!

Hey, look, Sheldon!
Birdie, birdie, birdie!

That's it! Prepare
for marshmallow death!

Eat flaming Nerf!

So anyway...

That's great news
about you and Bernadette.

Yeah. I think I'm gonna take
her to miniature golf.

Ah. Well, I guess

for you guys that's
like regular golf.

Short jokes? Really?
You're, like,

a quarter of an inch
taller than me.

Yeah, and don't
you forget it.

I had a good time.

Me, too.

Kiss her good night.

All right, now a little tongue.

GEORGE TAKEI:
Hold on there.

We've only just rekindled
the romance.

Let's not sully the moment
with the exchange of saliva.

Don't listen to him.

She wants it.

Tongue.

La, la, la, la, la.

See?

Now make the move.

Mm-mmm.
Too soon.

Trust me, she's ready.

Make the move.

No, no, no.

A lady wants to be wooed,

courted slowly.

How would you know?

I read.

Listen to me, Howard, it's time.

Make the move, now.

Mm! What are you doing?

You said... well,
the "move," remember?

Oh, not now.

We're starting a
new relationship.

I need to get to
know you again.

No, you don't.

It's me.

The lusty charmer
with the fancy patter

and the hoochie pants.

Be patient;
we'll get there.

Told you.

Oh, God, what's that smell?

Oh-ho-hoo!

Yes?

What are you
doing in there?

I'm making
hydrogen sulfide
and ammonia gas.

Just a little experiment
in pest control.

It's not gonna work, dude;
I grew up in India--

an entire subcontinent
where cows walk in the street,

and nobody has ever had
a solid bowel movement.

Well, we'll just see
how long you can hold out.

Well, we'll just see how

your noxious gas fares
against my cinnamon-

apple-scented
aroma therapy candles.

Didn't you say you're
making hydrogen sulfide gas?

Yes.
Isn't that flammable?

Highly.

Oh, dear.

This is not over.



Let's see,
Raj was the kung pao�chicken.

 I'm the dumplings.
 Yes, you are.

Creepy, Howard.

Creepy good or creepy bad?

Who was the shrimp
with lobster sauce?

That would be me.
Come to papa, you un-kosher delight.

I'm not necessarily
talking to the food.

Sit over there.

Sit over there.

Baby wipe?

 Why do you have...
 No, don't ask! Don't!

I'll tell you why.

I had to sanitize my hands
because the university

replaced the paper towels
in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.

I thought the blowers
were more sanitary.

 Really, don't.
 Why...?

Hot air blowers
are incubators and spewers

of bacteria and pestilence.

Frankly, it'd be more hygienic

if they had a plague-infested gibbon
sneeze my hands dry.

Hey, guys, I just got
the most amazing news...

Do you think you'll ever be able to talk
in front of me without being drunk?

Okay, I'll just,

go eat by myself.

You don't have to do that.

It's okay, between him not talking,
him talking and him...

I'm better off alone.

Good-bye, you poor,
strange little man.

She's so considerate.

What's your news?

Remember that little planetary object
I spotted beyond the Kuiper Belt?

Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ Sub-17.

Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood.

Anyway, because of my discovery,
People magazine is naming me

one of their 30 under 30 to watch.

Congratulations.

That's incredible.

Excuse me,

30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

30 visionaries under 30 years of age

to watch as they challenge
the preconceptions of their fields.

If I had a million guesses,
I never would have gotten that.

They've got me in with a guy who's doing
something about hunger in Indonesia,

and a psychotherapist who's using
dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners,

and Ellen Page,

star of the charming
independent film, Juno.

I'd so do her.

You'd do the dolphins.

Do I get an honorable
mention for designing

the telescope camera
mounting bracket you used?

Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative

in which a humble boy from New Delhi

overcame poverty and prejudice

and journeyed to America
to reach for the stars.

Poverty?
Your father's a gynecologist.

He drives a Bentley.

It's a lease.

I'm confused.

Was there some sort
of peer review committee

to determine which scientists
would be included?

Peer review?
It's People magazine.

People picked me.

 What people?
 The people from People.

But exactly who are these people?
What are their credentials?

How are they qualified?

What makes accidentally
noticing a hunk of rock

that's been traipsing around
the solar system for billions of years

more noteworthy than any other
scientific accomplishment

made by someone under 30?

Boy, I'll bet Ellen Page's friends
aren't giving her this kind of crap.

Are you proud of yourself?

In general, yes.

Subtitles: sub-way.fr

There's my missing neutrino.

You were hiding from me
as an unbalanced charge,

weren't you,
you little sub-atomic dickens?

Hey, look,
I found my missing neutrino.

Oh good, we can take it
off the milk carton.

We're going to apologize to Raj
and invite him out to dinner.

Apologize for what?

He came over last night
with some pretty good news

and we weren't very supportive.

I sense you're trying
to tell me something.

You were a colossal asshat.

No, I beg to differ.

Of the three of us, I was by far
the most supportive.

Really? Do tell.

How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?

When I was 11,

my sister bought our father
a "World's Greatest Dad" coffee mug

and, frankly, the man coasted
until the day he died.

Okay, let's try it this way.

What if this People magazine thing
is the best he's ever gonna achieve?

I had not considered that.

Come on.

I often forget
other people have limitations.

It's so sad.

 He can feel sadness?
 Not really.

It's what you and I
would call condescension.

Now when we go in there,
let's show Raj that we're happy for him.

But I'm not.

Well, then fake it.

Look at me.
I could be grinding on the fact

that without my stabilizing
telescope mount

he never would have found that stupid,
little clump of cosmic schmutz.

But I'm bigger than that.

Fine.
What do you want me to do?

Smile.

Crap, that's terrifying.

We're here to see Koothrappali,
not kill Batman.

Try less teeth.

Close enough.
Come on.

 Hey, Raj.
 Hey, guys. What's up?

We just wanted
to invite you out to dinner.

To celebrate your
"30 under 30" thing.

Right, Sheldon?

That's very nice of you.
I would like that.

Hello, boys.
Dr. Gablehauser.

 Dr. Koothrappali.
 Dr. Gablehauser.

 Dr. Hofstader.
 Dr. Gablehauser.

 Dr. Cooper.
 Dr. Gablehauser.

Mr. Wolowitz.

Boys, I've got a question for you:
Who in this room

discovered a star?

Actually, 2008-NQ Sub-17
is a planetary body.

I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about me.

You, my exotic young friend,

are my star.

But you didn't discover him.
You merely noticed he was here,

much like he did
with 2008-NQ Sub-17.

Sorry.

Boy, we've got to get you
into a better office.

Something more suited
to your status.

You don't have to go to any trouble.

How about Von Gerlich's old office?

I'd rather have Fishbein's.
It's bigger.

Wait a minute,
I called dibs on Fishbein's office

the day he started showing up
at work in his bathrobe.

He gets a new office, I can't even get
paper towels in the men's room?

Damn, this is hard.

Let me ask you something.

What do you think
the business of this place is?

 Science?
 Money.

Told you.

And this boy's picture
in People magazine

is gonna raise us a pile
of money taller than...

well, taller than you.

I have a Master's degree.

Who doesn't?

Have you ever had lunch
in the president's dining room?

I didn't even know there was
a president's dining room.

It's the same food
as the cafeteria, only fresh.

 Come on, little buddy.
 Okay, big buddy.

See you tonight, guys.

You can stop smiling now.

So anyway, after a fantastic lunch,

I was whisked off
to the People magazine photo shoot...

Have any of you boys
ever been to a photo shoot?

It's fantastic.

Apparently,
the camera loves me and I, it.

They shot me in front of a starry
background where I posed like this.

They're going to digitally add
a supernova.

They say it's the perfect metaphor
for my incandescent talent.

Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas
that collapses upon itself.

Excuse me.
Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor.

Go for Koothrappali.

They gave him an assistant?

If I want a new pen, I have to go
to the bank with wire cutters.

Have we at this point
met our social obligations?

Not yet.

Okay, just put it on my calendar,

but start thinking of a reason
why I can't go.

All righty?
Koothrappali out.

God bless that boy.
I don't know what I'd do without him.

You just got him this afternoon.

Yes, but I'm finding
that having a lackey suits me.

A lackey?

I'm sorry.
Is that politically incorrect?

In India, we just call them
untouchables.

 Now?
 Almost.

Speaking of untouchables,
I've got great news for you guys.

People magazine is having
a reception this Saturday

and I managed to get you invited.

 Gee, thanks.
 You're welcome.

Of course, I couldn't get you
into the VIP section

because, you know, that's for VIPs

and you guys are just,
you know... P's.

There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea

where, when a hunter
flaunts his success

to the rest of the village,
they kill him

and drive away evil spirits
with a drum made of his skin.

Superstious nonsense, of course,

but one can see their point.

Here you go, Raj.
You might want to drink this one slowly.

So, Saturday night,
can I count on my posse?

Gee, I'd love to, Raj,
but I can't make it.

No, I could...

I can make it. But I won't.

What are you talking about?

There's a reception
for my magazine article on Saturday.

And you guys aren't going?

I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating
a tremendous accomplishment

and you're not even going
to support him?

A tremendous accomplishment would be
if the planetary body he discovered

were plummeting toward Earth
and he exploded it with his mind.

That would be cool.
I'd go to that reception.

Come on, this is huge.
Raj is gonna be in People magazine,

and he didn't even have to knock up
one of the Spears sisters.

Would you like to go with me?

Of course I would.
I would be honored.

Really? Cool.

Shame on you guys.

Look at that,
I got a date with Penny.

I can't believe
it took you a whole year.

 Now?
 Now.

Hey, buddy,

I'm going to be
in People magazine.

Yeah, call me
when you're on the cover.

Raj, look at you!

I know. I'm resplendent
like the noonday sun, am I not?

Yeah. Starting with the champagne
a little early, aren't you?

It was in the limo.
They sent a limo.

I have a limo.
I just love saying "limo."

 Sip on it while you're getting ready.
 I'm ready.

That's what you're wearing?

Why, what's wrong with it?

Nothing. I was just hoping
for something a little more, you know,

ridonkulous.

Yeah. Well, this is all the donkulous
you're gonna get tonight.

Okey-dokey, let's roll.

All right, it's time
to raise the roof!

 Hey, Leonard.
 Dude.

You look very nice.

Thank you.

 Come on. Good night.
 Good night.

Hey, Leonard, do you
see my limo downstairs?

It's bigger than the house
my grandfather grew up in.

 Terrific.
 It has more food, too.

Come on. Come on.

Good news. You don't have to sulk
about Penny anymore.

There are hundreds of Croatian women
just waiting for you to contact them.

Anything-for-a-greencard.com?

I'll lend you my user name.
It's "Wealthy Big Penis."

You're joking.

You gotta make it easy for 'em.
They're just learning English.

Pass.

So you're just gonna
sit around here and mope

while Penny is out with Dr. Apu
from the Kwik-E Mart?

It's not a date,
and that's racist.

It can't be racist.

He's a beloved character
on The Simpsons.

Let's just eat
so I can get to bed.

With any luck, tonight will be the night
my sleep apnea kills me.

Did you ask for the chicken
with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?

Even though the menu description
specifies "shredded"?

Brown rice, not white?

Did you stop at the Korean grocery
and get the good hot mustard?

Did you pick up the low sodium
soy sauce from the market?

 Thank you.
 You're welcome.

What took you so long?

 Just sit down and eat.
 Fine.

All right, it's shredded.
What do you want me to do?

I want you to check
before you accept the order.

Sorry.

Were you distracted by the possibility
that Koothrappali

might have intercourse
with Penny tonight?

He's not going to have
intercourse with Penny.

Then there's no excuse
for this chicken.

You know, this situation
with Koothrappali

brings to mind
a story from my childhood.

Oh, goody, more tales
from the panhandle.

That's northwest Texas.
I'm from east Texas,

the Gulf region,
home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.

Do the shrimpers feature
in your story?

Anyway,
when I was eight,

a Montgomery Ward delivery van
ran over our family cat Lucky.

 Lucky?
 Yes, Lucky.

He's irony-impaired.
Just move on.

Dead cat named Lucky.
Continue.

While others mourned Lucky,

I realized his untimely demise

provided me with the opportunity
to replace him

with something more suited
to my pet needs:

a faithful companion
that I could snuggle with at night,

yet would be capable of killing
upon telepathic command.

So not a puppy?

Please, nothing so pedestrian.

I wanted a griffin.

A griffin?

Yes, half eagle, half lion.

And mythological.

Irrelevant.

I was studying
recombinant DNA technology,

and I was confidant I could create one,
but my parents were unwilling

to secure the necessary
eagle eggs and lion semen.

Of course, my sister got swimming
lessons when she wanted them.

Not that we don't all enjoy
a good lion semen story,

 but what's your point?
 My point is

if Koothrappali is moving on

to a new life
of shallow undeserved fame,

perhaps this is an opportunity
to create a better cohort.

You want to breed a new friend?

That's one option,
but who has the time?

But consider this--
the Japanese are doing

some wonderful work
with artificial intelligence.

Now, you combine that
with some animatronics

from the imagineers over at Disney,

next thing you know,
we're playing Halo

with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.

Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.

That may well be, but the fact is

it wouldn't kill us
to meet some new people.

For the record, it could kill us
to meet new people.

They could be murderers
or the carriers of unusual pathogens.

And I'm not insane.
My mother had me tested.

If we do get a new friend,

 he should be a guy who has your back.
 He should have a lot of money

and live in a cool place by the beach
where we could throw parties.

 And share our love of technology.
 And he should know a lot of women.

Let's see, money,
women, technology.

Okay, we're agreed.
Our new friend is going to be Iron Man.

Welcome to the Raj Mahal.

It's very nice.
Good night.

 Wait. The evening's not over.
 Yes, it is.

No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly
and suck face.

Is the evening over?

Wait, wait, wait!

That's my mommy and daddy
calling from India.

 I want you to meet my parents.
 Wait. Meet them?

Hello, Mommy, Daddy.
Good to see you.

How are you?
I'm not drunk.

 Why would you say that?
 Just making conversation.

Mommy, Daddy, I want you
to meet my new squeeze, Penny.

I'm not your squeeze.
There is no squeezing.

I can't see her.
Center her in the frame.

Here you go. Cute, huh?

She's not Indian.

So she's not Indian.
The boy is just sowing some wild oats.

There's no sowing, no squeezing
and no sucking face.

What if he gets her pregnant?

Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want
as the mother of your grandchildren?

What right do you have to pick
with whom I can have children with?

Look, Rajesh, I understand,
you're in America.

You want to try
the "local cuisine."

Trust me.
You don't want it for a steady diet.

Now you listen to me.
I am no longer a child

and I will not be
spoken to like one.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go throw up.

 What's wrong with him?
 I don't know.

Maybe it's the local cuisine.

Well, it's nice to meet you.

I'm just gonna
set you on down over here.

And I'm gonna leave, so...

namaste.

And FYI, you'd be lucky
to have me as a daughter-in-law.

She's feisty.

I like that.

Raj, what are you doing?

No notes. If you have
something to say to me, say it.

Sorry.

Sweetie, it's okay.



Are you from the Star Wars universe?

 Were you in the original trilogy?
 Yes.

Is there a picture of you
in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?

God, I hope not.

And no, I'm not Princess Leia.

Okay. My turn.

Are you in all six Star Wars movies?

 Yes.
 Interesting.

Are you a droid?

Do you kind of look like
a shiny Sheldon?

 C-3PO.
 You got it.

That's preposterous.

I do not resemble C-3PO.

Don't get me wrong.
I'm flattered. I just don't see it.

Leslie Winkle.

You've reached
"Friends with Benefits."

For a booty call, press one now.

What exactly does
that expression mean,

"friends with benefits"?

Does he provide her
with health insurance?

Imagine you maintained a friendship
with someone you had sex with,

but you were free to date
whoever you wanted.

I'm sorry.
I can't imagine any of that.

 All right. Back to the game.
 I believe it's my turn.

You may begin your questions
whenever you're ready.

Are you Spock?

I don't like this game.

So, where were we?

Aren't you leaving
for your booty call?

No, it was something else.

Why does everything have to be
about sex with you? Come on.

Whose turn is it?

 We were up to you.
 Great. Just start.

Let's see. Are you from a TV series?

She dumped me!

I bet he's someone from Babylon 5.
We're never going to get it.

Subtitles: The FWT Team

What happened?
Why did she dump you?

I don't know. She just said,
"Howard, Mama's a rolling stone."

Then her call waiting beeped
and she was gone.

I don't understand.

If you were
in a non-emotional relationship,

then why are you having what appears
to be an emotional response?

He obviously had feelings for her.

Of course I had feelings for her.
I saw her naked, for God's sake.

Okay, you just need
to get your mind off it.

Do you want to go
to the comic book store?

 Maybe go see a movie?
 I don't want to go anywhere.

You know,

I'm given to understand
that there's an entire city in Nevada

designed specifically to help people
like Howard forget their problems.

They can replace them
with new problems,

such as alcoholism, gambling addiction,
and sexually transmitted diseases.

Is it me, or was that
Sheldon's way of saying, "Vegas, baby!"?

 I've never been there. Have you?
 Me? No.

I just got "Vegas, baby!"
from Vince Vaughn in Swingers.

It could be fun.
My weekend's wide open, now that...

Okay, let's do this.
Let's go to Las Vegas.

Now? Right now?

Why not? People do things "right now,"
all the time.

Why can't we be
"right now" people, too?

Go home, pack a bag,
and we'll be "right now" people.

I have to stop at the drug store
to refill a prescription,

but after that, we'll go right now.

What do you say, Howard?

I say...

"Vegas, baby!"

 What are you gonna tell your mother?
 "Sea World, baby!"

 Are you coming?
 I'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs

and hatch larvae
in my auditory canal.

Great.
We'll bring you back a t-shirt.

Thank you.

Hello, neighbor.

Hello, Sheldon.

And how are you this fine evening?

 Great.
 Good. I'm glad.

Really?
Are you drunk?

I'm just in a good mood.

While my compatriots
are in Las Vegas,

I will be enjoying a blissful evening
in my personal Fortress of Solitude.

That's Superman's
big ice thingy, right?

You know, I'm in such a good mood,

I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp
of the English language

folksy and charming today.

What smells so good?

That is the intoxicating
aroma of Kadhai Paneer,

a perfect culinary representation
of the freedom this evening holds.

Not only is it Indian cuisine,
which Koothrappali loathes,

it contains
a generous helping of peanuts,

which would reduce Wolowitz
to a wheezing 97-pound blister.

And finally,
its main ingredient is paneer,

a farmer's cheese

that would cause Leonard to render
any room uninhabitable within minutes.

Yum.

Well, enjoy your big evening.

I realize you're also
on your own tonight,

so if, at some point, you find
yourself with nothing to do,

please do not disturb me.

Have fun, Sheldon.

I shall.

What's wrong, Superman?
Locked out of your big ice thingy?

Look at this.
Mouthwash, lotion, body wash.

Shampoo and conditioner
together in one tiny bottle.

I love Las Vegas.

Howard, could I borrow
some aftershave?

Black case, top compartment.

That's a lot of cologne.

First row are your musks.
Second is woods,

leathers and botanicals.

Third is assorted pheromones.
Tread lightly.

That's the spirit, Howard.

Yes, we can.

Let's go.

You guys go ahead.
I just have to finish up an email.

That's not an email.
That's Leslie's Facebook page.

Fine.

I'm checking her Facebook page.
Look at her status update.

She's saying she dumped me.
People need to know I dumped her.

But she did dump you.

Grow up, Raj. There's no place
for truth on the Internet.

Just go.
I'll catch up with you.

All right.

We should have a plan
in case one of us gets lucky.

Okay, if I get lucky,

I'll take her to my stately manor
outside Gotham City, and...

if you get lucky,
I'll sleep on the moon.

Sounds like a plan.

Hang on. I think the emergency key
is around here somewhere.

We have a bowl.

Our keys go in a bowl.

You should get a bowl.

So, how did the beautiful mind
of Sheldon Cooper

forget his key in the first place?

I left them in the bowl.

I just remembered
where the emergency key is.

Where?
In your apartment.

 What's it doing in my apartment?
 I went in there a few weeks ago

and you guys weren't
home and I forgot it there.

You went in my... Why would...
What are you saying?

It's not a big deal. I was making coffee
and I ran out of milk.

You're the milk thief!

Leonard said I was crazy,
but I knew that carton felt lighter.

All right. Just calm down.

I will call the building manager
and he'll come open your door.

Eat your dinner here
while you're waiting.

Eat? My dinner?
In your apartment?

Why not?

Sure. Why not?

And after the sun's down,
we can all pile in my pickup

and go skinny-dipping
down at the creek.

'Cause today's the day
to stop making sense.

Thanks.

I'm telling you, Leonard...
video slots...

free drinks brought to us
by a bosomy barmaid

and all you can eat shrimp
for $3.95.

Disneyland can suck it.

This is the real
happiest place on earth.

Dude, check it out!
That's laundry for a month!

Hi.

Hello.

 What's your name?
 Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

Hello, Rajesh Ra...

Hi, Rajesh.

 I'm Michaela.
 Hello, Michaela.

So, you interested
in a little party?

Why, yes, I love to party.

Party is my middle name.

Or, it would be
if it weren't Ramayan.

 Can I talk to you for a moment?
 Not now.

Michaela's inviting me to a party.

You better call the moon
and make sure they have a bed for you.

Yeah. I really need to talk to you.

Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere. Don't move.

Just stay the beautiful, unspoiled
American flower that you are.

What's wrong with you, dude?
That woman was all up in my jammy.

Okay, I hate to break this to you
and whatever your "jammy" is, but...

I'm pretty sure she's a prostitute.

What?

Let me put it this way:
In your entire life,

how many gorgeous women
have walked straight up to you in a bar

and asked if you wanted to party?

Maybe I can save her.

Maybe, but I'm guessing it'll cost you
about $500 an hour to try.

It was lovely meeting you.
Best of luck in your future endeavors.

Whatever.

I miss her already.

Howard's losing it.

Check out his latest Twitters.

"I'm at the bottom of a black hole
staring into the abyss.

"My life is meaningless.
My future is without hope."

Why don't we take him
to see the Blue Man Group?

You think that'd help?

USA Today calls them
"exuberant fun for the whole family."

I don't know, Howard isn't really
the family fun kind of guy.

It's too bad he wasn't here
for that hooker.

She's exactly his type; a hooker.

You know, I bet if we hired her,
that would cheer him up.

We're not gonna get
Wolowitz a hooker.

"I'm so lonely and horny,

"I may open this $20 jar
of peanuts and end it all."

I suppose it wouldn't hurt
to get an estimate.

So how was your day?

Are you trying to make small talk?

Sweetie, you really don't have to.

No, it's the accepted convention.

How was your day?

They shifted my schedule around
at the restaurant,

 so my hours are gonna be...
 I'm sorry.

That's not going to interest me at all.
Just eat.

Hello again.

Hi. Listen...

If you're not busy,
we were thinking maybe you could...

 We were wondering...
 If you're really a prostitute.

 You guys cops?
 No.

I'm a prostitute.

Okay, great.

The thing is, we've got this friend,
and he's kind of down in the dumps.

And we thought maybe you
could cheer him up.

With sex.

I think she knows what I meant.

How when you beat around the bush?
She's from the mean streets

where they shoot from the hip
and keep it real.

Don't worry.
I can take good care of your friend.

Okay, terrific.

Listen, is there
a way that we can do this

where he doesn't know
that you're a, you know...

Prostitute.

You want the girlfriend experience.

Yes. Yeah, exactly.
The girlfriend experience.

Actually,
if it's not too much to ask,

could we have the Jewish
girlfriend experience?

Okay, that's question 20.
You have to guess.

I don't know, Sheldon.

Are you Star Wars?

How can one person be a whole movie?

I give up.
Can we just do something else?

Fine.

I was Spock.

Are you and Leonard
friends with benefits?

What?

Are you and Leonard
friends with benefits?

Where did that even come from?
Did he say we were?

No, Leonard said nothing.
But who knows what goes on over here

when he pretends
your mail was misdelivered?

Just mail, no benefits.

I see.

Why are you asking?

I'm curious about the
whole social construct.

On its face, the idea
of satisfying one's sexual appetite,

assuming one is afflicted with such,

without emotional entanglement,

that seems eminently practical.

What I've observed, however,

is Howard Wolowitz
crying like a little girl.

Some people just can't handle
that kind of relationship.

Can you?

Excuse me?

Are you able to have sex with men

without developing
an emotional attachment?

I really... don't want
to talk about this with you.

Is this conversation making you
uncomfortable?

Of course it's making me uncomfortable.
Can't you tell?

I really have no idea.

I don't particularly excel
at reading facial expressions...

I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!

Thank you. That's very helpful.

All right, where are
these amazing shrimp?

Behold.

Seriously, you think this is
the size of a baby's arm?

A little baby.

I'm going back to the room.

Boy, would it maybe kill them
to put out a nice brisket?

Hi, there. Howard Wolowitz.

Esther Rosenblatt.

I don't think the manager's
coming tonight, so here.

Are you suggesting
I sleep on the couch?

It wasn't the first suggestion
that came to mind,

but it's the one I'm going with.

I can't sleep on your couch.
I sleep in a bed.

And given its dimensions, I have
no intention of living out Snickering's

beloved children's book,
The Tall Man From Cornwall.

What?

"There was a tall man from Cornwall

"whose length exceed his bed.

"My body fits on it,
but barely upon it,

"there's no room
for my big Cornish head."

All right, I will give you my bed
on one condition:

that you promise to zip your hole
for the next eight hours.

May I say one last thing?

Only if it doesn't rhyme.

All right.

Good night.

Turn-ons? Let me see.

Reading a good book
in front of the fire,

long walks on the beach...

and getting freaky on the Sabbath
with a bacon cheeseburger.

Really? Me, too!

Oy, gevalt, you're hot.

Excuse me for a moment.

How's it going?

Cut the crap.
You set this up, didn't you?

She's a hooker, isn't she?

A prostitute, yes.

You already gave her the money?

Thank you!

What?

I can't sleep.

Maybe that's because your hole
is still open.

I'm homesick.

Your home is 20 feet from here.

20 feet, 20 light-years,
it doesn't matter.

It's in a galaxy far, far away.

Damn it.

What do you want me to do?

Sing Soft Kitty.

That's only for when you're sick.

Homesick is a type of being sick.

Come on, do I really have to?

I suppose we can stay up and talk.

Soft kitty

Warm kitty

Little ball of fur

Happy kitty

 Sleepy kitty.
 Sleepy kit...

Start over.

Soft kitty

Warm kitty

Little ball of fur

Happy kitty

Sleepy kitty

Purr, purr, purr

Thank you for letting me stay here.

You're welcome, sweetie.

Okay, I'm sleepy now.
Get out.

Good. You're finally home.

What were you doing at Penny's?

Well, we had dinner,

played some games,
and then I spent the night.

You'll be happy to know
that I now have

a much better understanding
of "friends with benefits."



Worst. Renaissance. Fair. Ever.

Please let it go, Sheldon.

It was rife
with historical inaccuracies.

For example, the tavern girl
serving flagons of mead.

Her costume
was obviously Germanic.

But in 1487,

the Bavarian purity laws,
or Reinheitsgebot,

severely limited
the availability of mead.

At best, they would have had
some sort of spiced wine.

 You're nitpicking.
 Oh, really?

Well, here's another nit for you:
the flagons

would not have been made
of polypropylene.

Renaissance fairs
aren't about historical accuracy.

They're about taking chubby girls
who work at Kinko's

and lacing them up
in corsets so tight

their bosom jumps out
and says, "Howdy."

Bosoms would not have said
"howdy" in the 15th century.

If anything,
they would've said, "Huzzah."

I don't care
what the bosoms say.

I just want to be part
of the conversation.

Hi, guys.

Looks like you've been
to the renaissance fair...

I'm hoping.

Renaissance fair? More of a medieval,
slash, Age of Enlightenment,

slash, any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece
fair.

Okay, fine, whatever.
This is my friend Eric.

 Hello.
 Hey.

So, yeah, good to see you.

It's good to see you, too.

We should probably go.
Bye, guys.

I like your hat.

Thanks, my mom made it.

Penny with a new guy,
tr�s awkward.

It wasn't awkward.

It wasn't fun.

Besides, what's the big deal?

We dated, we stopped dating,
and now we're both moving on.

By moving on, do you mean
she's going out with other men

and you spent the afternoon
making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?

That was not 15th century soap.
My God, those people need to learn

you can't just put "ye olde"
in front of anything you want

and expect to get away with it.

Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

You're wearing modern underwear?

Relatively modern.

What are you wearing?

I fashioned historically accurate
undergarments out of linen.

You bought linen?

Don't be silly...
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.

Borrowed?


I'm happy that Penny's moving on.

It gives me the freedom
to move on myself.

Are you saying
that you've been holding back?

Of course.
Out of respect.

So, how do you explain
the ten years before Penny?

Who were you respecting then?

Well, I've dated plenty of women.

There was Joyce Kim...

Leslie Winkle...

Notify the editors
of the Oxford English Dictionary.

The word "plenty" has been
redefined to mean "two."

What about that girl
last year at Comic-Con?

 Doesn't count.
 Why not?

What happens in costume
at Comic-Con stays at Comic-Con.

You're saying that
because of what happened to you.

 What happened to you?
 Nothing happened to me.

It wasn't your fault.

He was dressed as a green
Orion slave girl.

How did we get on me?!

We were mocking Leonard
for not moving on.

Dude, you have totally not moved on.

Yes, I have.

It's just a matter of actually
making a date with someone.

Like who?

Well... there's Joyce Kim.

But she defected
back to North Korea, so...

it's a little
geographically undesirable.

 What about Leslie Winkle?
 Oh, no.

 Why?
 Her research methodology is sloppy,

she's unjustifiably arrogant
about loop quantum gravity,

and to make matters worse,
she's often mean to me.

 I think she's smoking hot.
 I'd hit that.

You'd hit particulate soil
in a colloidal suspension.

Mud.

I like Leslie, but she's not interested
in dating

as much as using men
as tools for stress release.

Yeah, so? Be a tool.

Go get yourself a little rebound
"stress release."

Technically, it would only
be rebound if he and Penny

had actually engaged
in physical intimacy.

Like you and Richard the slave girl?

I bought him dinner
and we kissed once! That was it.

And he told me
his name was Kimberly.

You know how I know
we're not in the matrix?

How?

If we were,
the food would be better.

Hey, Leonard.

 Hey, Leslie.
 Hey, dummy.

Hello, to you...

insufficiently intelligent person.

Ooh, rush me to the burn unit.

Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.

 Sure.
 If you'll excuse me,

I'm going to go do work

that promises significant results,
as opposed to what you do...

which does not.

Yeah, you heard me.

So, I heard your relationship
with Penny crashed to the ground

like blue ice falling out
of an airplane lavatory.

Where did you hear that?

Actually, I read it.
Wolowitz texted me.

"Like blue ice falling out
of an airplane lavatory," yeah.

I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an LOL.

Anyway, it got me thinking.
Now that you're unattached,

maybe we can revisit
our previous attachment.

Are you suggesting another bout
of stress release?

No, I'm all done with casual sex.
From now on, I'm fully committed

to the traditional
relationship paradigm.

 Really? What changed?
 It's hard to say.

I guess there's a time
in every woman's life

when she gets tired
of waking up on a strange futon

with a bunch of people
she doesn't know.

Yeah, I can see how that would--
a bunch of people?

Anyway, I figure it's time
to slow things down and,

who better to slow things down
with than you?

I'm flattered.

So,

how do you suggest we proceed?

Your place, we'll order Chinese,
you'll rent a movie--

artsy, but accessible--
then light petting, no coitus.

Sounds fun.

I'll leave the details up to you.
It's better if you assume the male role.

Thank you, that's very thoughtful.

Great.

Call me.

Great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.

 Terrific.
 You know what this means, don't you?

Break out the Red Bull,
it's time to rock Mario, old school.

 I kind of have other plans tonight.
 But it's Friday.

Friday's always vintage game night.

Look, Mom included the memory card.

We can pick up right
where I left off in 1999

when I had pernicious anemia.

The thing is, someone's coming over.

No problem. I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.

It's a date.
I have a date coming over.

You can't blame me for not
jumping to that conclusion.

Why? What's so unusual
about me having a date?

 Statistically speaking...
 All right, all right.

Nevertheless, I have one now
and I'd appreciate it if you would,

make yourself scarce.

I'm a published theoretical physicist
with two doctorates

and an IQ which can't be accurely
measured by normal tests.

How much scarcer could I be?

You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?

 You want me to leave the apartment?
 Yes.

You mean, just go
someplace else and be...

someplace else?

Yes.

Why should I leave?
This is my apartment, too.

I know,

and if science ever discovers
a second member of your species

and you two would like some privacy,

I'd be more than happy
to get out of your way.

Well, all right then.

What are you doing?

Playing Super Mario

on a poorly coded
Nintendo 64 emulator.

Why are you doing it on the stairs?

I am a modern day Napoleon
exiled to the Elba of the staircase

because Leonard, get this,
has a date.

Good for him.

Why are you sitting here? Why don't you
just go to a movie or something?

Alone?

 Yeah, why not?
 What if I choke on my popcorn?

Who will administer
the Heimlich maneuver?

Then don't order popcorn.

No popcorn at the mo...
listen to yourself.

 Why don't you go to a coffee shop?
 I don't drink coffee.

They have other things.

What do they have?

You know, cookies, pastries...

Pastries such as bear claws?

 Yeah, sure.
 I don't like bear claws.

Hey, Penny.

Dumbass.

Leslie Winkle.

Of all the overrated physicists
in all the labs in all the world,

why does it have to be
Leslie Winkle?

They have a lot in common.
I mean, they're both scientists.

Oh, please. The only way she could make
a contribution to science

would be if they resumed
sending chimps into space.

Okay, well, I have a date, too,
so I'll see ya.

Everybody has a date.

Even you, Mario,
going after Princess Peach.

And what am I doing?
I'm just enabling you.

 This is pretty good orange chicken.
 Yeah, it's from Chang's.

 Not Chow's?
 No, Chang's.

 What happened to Chow's?
 It changed.

So,

how many children
do you think we should have?

I'm sorry.
That was a little abrupt.

A little?

There are so many things to talk about
before we discuss reproduction.

I sure hope so.

Besides shortness, what genetic
weaknesses run in your family?

Sorry to interrupt.

Battery's dying. Continue.

Genetic weakness, right.

There's the lactose intolerance.

Don't forget
the male-pattern baldness.

When his uncles sit around
the dinner table,

they look like a half carton of eggs.

Okay, my uncles are bald,

but my Aunt Edna is one
of the hairiest women you'll ever meet.

Sweet lady.

Always tickles when she hugs me.

 What now?
 I have to make pee-pee.

I'm sorry
about all of Sheldon's interruptions.

He can be a bit of an eccentric.

If by "eccentric"
you mean passive-aggressive

East Texas blowhole, I agree.

I think tonight was a very good start.

Me, too.

You sure you're okay
postponing intercourse

until our relationship is past
the initial viability test?

No problem, I'm very skilled
at postponing intercourse.

I guess I'll call you
and we'll arrange another evening.

I believe protocol dictates you wait
a minimum of 18 hours before you call

so I'm not repulsed
by your cloying eagerness.

Sure.

Again, it's your decision.
You're the man.

It wasn't my cat.

It was an experiment
designed by this guy named Schroedinger.

From the Charlie Brown cartoons?

No, he was some kind of scientist.
Let me start again.

 Hey, Leonard.
 Hello.

 Leslie.
 Hi.

Okay, well... good night.

Okay, good night.

That ain't gonna make your point.

That's enough.

Call me.

Right.

Okay, good night.

 What?
 Had a great time. Ciao.

I'm sorry, I am not going back
to the Renaissance fair.

Come on,

there's so few places
I can wear my jester costume.

I don't care.

There are far too many
historical anomalies for my comfort.

Okay, how about this?

You can go dressed
as a Star Trek science officer

exploring a planet similar
to Earth in the 1500s.

You mean, like Spock?

Sure.

Fascinating.

Hey, fellow scientists...

Why don't we all move over there
so Leslie can join us?

Let's do it.

If you're having trouble
deciding where to sit,

may I suggest one potato, two potato?

Or as I call it, "the Leslie Winkle
experimental methodology."

 Don't make this hard for me.
 It's not hard.

It's simple.

You can either sit with me,
your friend, colleague and roommate

or with an overrated scientist
you might have sex with.

You're right, it is simple.

 Hey, Sheldon.
 Penny.

Third floor tonight...
mixing it up?

I still don't understand why you don't
go to dinner or something.

All right,
let's say I go to dinner alone,

and during the meal,
I have to use the restroom.

How do I know
someone's not touching my food?

Good night, Sheldon.

Penny, hold on.

Are you sure things can't
work out with you and Leonard?

Excuse me?

I'm just wondering

if you really gave it
the old college try.

Or in your case,
the old community college try.

Okay, where is this coming from?

Leonard is upstairs right now
with my archenemy.

Your archenemy?

The Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic.

The Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man,
the Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel.

I get it.

It's amazing how many supervillains
have advanced degrees.

Graduate school should do a better job
of screening those people out.

Sheldon, come back.
You're losing me.

It's Leslie Winkle, Penny.

She belittles my research.

Sweetie, I'm sorry.

She called me "dumbass."

I know. I heard.

Given this situation,

I have no choice but to withdraw
my previous objections

to your ill-considered
relationship with Leonard.

Gee, well, thank you for that.

But I think for now,

Leonard and I are just gonna
stay friends.

No, that response
is unacceptable to me.

Sheldon, you are
a smart guy...

I'm "smart"?

I'd have to lose 60 IQ points
to be classified as "smart."

 Are you gonna let me talk?
 I'm sorry.

You must know that if Leonard
and Leslie want to be together,

nothing you can do is gonna stop it.

You continue to underestimate
my capabilities, madam.

Let me put it this way.
If you're really Leonard's friend,

you will support him
no matter who he wants to be with.

Wait a minute.
Why am I doing all the giving here?

If Leonard's really my friend,
why doesn't he have to support me

and my hatred of Leslie Winkle?

Because love trumps hate.

Now you're just making stuff up.

Okay, good night, Sheldon.

Mario...

If only I could control everyone
the way I control you.

Hop, you little plumber,
hop, hop, hop.

When the two of you reach
a natural stopping point,

I'd like to have a word.

If the word is "pee-pee,"
just do it.

Leonard, you're my friend,

and friends support
their friends... apparently.

So I'm withdrawing my objection

to your desire
to have a relationship with Leslie.

 Thank you.
 I will graciously

overlook the fact
that she is an arrogant,

subpar scientist who actually
believes loop quantum gravity

better unites quantum mechanics
with general relativity

than does string theory.

You kids have fun.

Hang on a second.

Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more
testable predictions than string theory.

I'm listening. Amuse me.

For one thing, we expect
quantized space-time to manifest itself

as minute differences in the speed
of light for different colors.

Balderdash.
Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.

Are you gonna let him
talk to me like that?

Okay, well, there is a lot
of merit to both theories.

No, there isn't.
Only loop quantum gravity

calculates the entropy of black holes.

Sheldon, don't make that noise.
It's disrespectful.

I should hope so.
It was a snort of derision.

You agree with me, right?

Loop quantum gravity
is the future of physics.

Sorry, Leslie, I guess I prefer
my space stringy, not loopy.

I'm glad I found out the truth about you
before this went any further.

Truth? What truth?

We're talking about untested hypothes.
It's no big deal.

It isn't? Really?

Tell me,
how will we raise the children?

I guess we wait until they're old enough
and let them choose their own theory.

We can't let them choose.
They're children!

Where are you going?

I'm sorry.

I could have accepted our kids being
genetically unable to eat ice cream

or ever get a good view of a parade.

But this?

This is a deal breaker.

Look on the bright side.

What's the bright side?

Only nine more months
to Comic-con.

Captain, I'm getting
an unusual reading.

That's great.
You guys want corn dogs?

That's a temporal anomaly.

Corn dog's didn't come into existence
till the first half of the 20th century.



Okay, if no one else will say it, I will.

We really suck at paintball.

That was absolutely humiliating.

you win, some battles you lose.

to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah party.

I think we have to acknowledge, those were
some fairly savage preadolescent Jews.

No, we were annihilated
by our own incompetence...

and the inability of some people
to follow the chain of command.

Sheldon, let it go.

No, I wanna talk about the fact
that Wolowitz shot me in the back.

I shot you for a good reason.
You were leading us into disaster.

I was giving clear, concise orders.

You hid behind a tree yelling:

"Get the kid in the yarmulke!
Get the kid in the yarmulke!"

 Oh, hey, guys.
 Oh, hey, Penny.

 Hello.
 Morning, ma'am.

So how was paintball?
Did you have fun?

Sure, if you consider being fragged
by your own troops fun.

You clear a space on your calendar.
There will be an inquiry.

Okay. Um...

I'm having a party on Saturday,
so if you're around, come by.

 A party?
 Yeah.

A boy-girl party?

There will be boys
and there will be girls...

and it is a party, so...

Just a bunch of my friends,
have some beer, do a little dancing.

 Dancing?
 Yeah.

 I don't know, Penny...
 Thing is, we're not...

 We're really more of a...
 No.

But thanks.
Thanks for thinking of us.

Are you sure? It's Halloween.

A Halloween party?

As in costumes?

Well, yeah.

Is there a theme?

Um, yeah, Halloween.

Yes, but are the costumes random
or genre-specific?

As usual, I'm not following.

He's asking if we can come as anyone
from science fiction...

 ...fantasy...
 Sure.

 Comic books?
 Fine.

 Anime?
 Of course.

TV, film, D&D, manga.
Greek, Roman, Norse gods...

Anything you want.

Okay? Any costume you want.

Bye.

Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.


I'll get it.

Psshoo.

Oh, no.

Oh, no.

Make way for the fastest man alive.

Oh, no.

See, this is why I wanted
to have a costume meeting.

We all have other costumes.
We can change.

Or we could walk right
behind each other all night.

It'll look like one person
going really fast.

No, no, no.

It's a boy-girl party,
this Flash runs solo.

Okay, how about this?
Nobody gets to be the Flash.

We all change. Agreed?

Agreed.

I call Frodo!

Damn.

Hey.

Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck
in the door on the bus.

 You went with Thor?
 What?

Just because I'm Indian,
I can't be a Norse god?

No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian god.

That's racism.

I mean, look at Wolowitz. He's not English,
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

Sheldon is neither sound nor light,
but he's obviously the Doppler effect.

 I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.
 Really?

Because I saw Peter Pan
and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby.

She was a little bigger than you,
but it's basically the same look, man.

Sheldon, there's something
I wanna talk to you about before we go.

I don't care if anybody gets it,
I'm going as the Doppler effect.

 No, it's not that...
 If I have to, I can demonstrate: Vroom.

Terrific. Um...

This party is my first chance for Penny...

to see me in the context
of her social group...

and I need you not
to embarrass me tonight.

What exactly do you mean
by embarrass you?

For example, tonight, no one needs to know
that my middle name is Leakey.

But there's nothing embarrassing
about that.

Your father worked with Louis Leakey,
a great anthropologist.

It had nothing to do
with your bed-wetting.

All I'm saying is that this party
is the perfect opportunity...

for Penny to see me
as a member of her peer group...

a potential close friend
and perhaps more.

I don't wanna look like a dork.

Just a heads up, fellas,
if anyone gets lucky...

I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver.

Oh, hey, guys.

Hey, sorry we're late.

Late? It's 7:05.

And you said the party starts at 7.

Yeah, I mean, when you start a party at 7,
no one shows up at, you know, 7.

It's 7:05.

Yes, yes, it is.

Okay, well, um, come on in.

What, are all the girls in the bathroom?

Probably, but in their own homes.

So, what time
does the costume parade start?

The parade?

Yeah, so the judges can give out
the prizes for best costume.

Most frightening, most authentic...

most accurate visualization
of a scientific principle.

Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry...

but there aren't gonna be any parades
or judges or prizes.

This party is just going to suck.

No, come on, it's gonna be fun.
And you all look great.

I mean, look at you, Thor,
and, oh, Peter Pan.

That's so cute.

 Actually, Penny, he's Robin...
 I'm Peter Pan.

And I've got a handful of pixie dust
with your name on it.

No, you don't.

 Hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?
 Oh, he's the Doppler effect.

Yes, it's the apparent change
in the frequency of a wave...

caused by relative motion between
the source of the wave and the observer.

Oh, sure, I see it now.
The Doppler effect.

All right, I gotta shower. You guys,
um, make yourselves comfortable.

Okay.

See? People get it.



Mm. By Odin's beard,
this is good Chex Mix.

No, thanks. Peanuts.

I can't afford to swell up in these tights.

I'm confused.

If there's no costume parade,
what are we doing here?

We're socializing, meeting new people.

Telepathically?

 Oh, hey. When did you get here?

Penny is wearing the worst
Catwoman costume I've ever seen.

And that includes Halle Berry's.

She's not Catwoman.
She's just a generic cat.

And that's the kind
of sloppy costuming...

which results
from a lack of rules and competition.

Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.

I believe it's time for me
to turn my head and cough.

 What is your move?
 I'm going to use the mirror technique.

She brushes her hair back, I brush mine.
She shrugs, I shrug.

Subconsciously, she's thinking,
"We're in sync. We belong together."

Where do you get this stuff?

You know, psychology journals,
Internet research.

And there's this great show on VH1
about how to pick up girls.

Oh, if only I had his confidence.

I have such difficulty
speaking to women...

or around women,
or at times even effeminate men.

If that's a working stethoscope...

maybe you'd like to hear
my heart skip a beat.

No, thanks.

No, seriously, you can.
I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.


So take my money

Take my money

I wanna get to know Penny's friends.
I just...

I don't know
how to talk to these people.

 Well, I actually might be able to help.
 How so?

Like Jane Goodall observing the apes...

I initially saw their interactions
as confusing and unstructured.

But patterns emerge.

They have their own language,
if you will.

Go on.

Well, it seems that the newcomer
approaches the existing group...

with the greeting,
"How wasted am I?"

Which is met
with an approving chorus of "Dude."

Then what happens?

That's as far as I've gotten.

This is ridiculous.

 I'm jumping in.
 Good luck.

No, you're coming with me.

Oh, I hardly think so.

Come on.

 Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
 Yes, but I need a wingman.

All right, but if we're going
to use flight metaphors...

I'm much more suited to being the guy
from the FAA analyzing wreckage.

Oh, hi.

 Hi.
 Hello.

So, what are you supposed to be?

Me?

I'll give you a hint.

Vroom.

A choo-choo train?

Close.

Vroom.

A brain-damaged choo-choo train?

How wasted am I?

Dancing all by myself

Cannot control the beat
When you make me weak

Vroom.


I still don't get it.

I'm the Doppler effect.

Okay, if that is some sort
of learning disability...

I think it's very insensitive.

Why don't you just tell people
you're a zebra?

Why don't you just tell people
you're one of the seven dwarves?

Because I'm Frodo.

Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.

 Oh, no.
 What?

That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

What do you suppose he's doing here?

Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

If he were any bigger,
he'd have moons orbiting him.

 Oh, snap.
 Ha-ha.

So I guess we'll be leaving now.

Why should we leave?

For all we know, he crashed the party
and Penny doesn't even want him here.

You have a backup hypothesis?

Maybe they just wanna be friends.

Or maybe she wants to be friends
and he wants something more.

Then he and I are on equal ground.

Yes, but you're much closer to it
than he is.

Look, if this was 15,000 years ago,
by virtue of his size and strength...

Kurt would be entitled
to his choice of female partners.

And male partners, animal partners,
large primordial eggplants...

pretty much
whatever tickled his fancy.

Yes, but our society
has undergone a paradigm shift.

In the information age, Sheldon,
you and I are the alpha males.

 And we shouldn't have to back down.
 True.

Why don't you text him that
and see if he backs down?

No.

I'm going to assert
my dominance face to face.

Face to face?

Are you gonna wait for him to sit down
or you gonna stand on the coffee table?

Hello, Penny. Hello, Kurt.

Oh, hey, guys.
You having a good time?

Given the reaction to my costume...

this party is a scathing indictment
of the American education system.

What? You're a zebra, right?

Yet another child left behind.

And what are you supposed to be,
an elf?

No, I'm a hobbit.

What's the difference?

A hobbit is a mortal, halfling inhabitant
of Middle-earth...

whereas an elf
is an immortal, tall warrior.

So why the hell
would you wanna be a hobbit?

Because he's neither tall nor immortal,
and none of us could be the Flash.

Well, whatever. Why don't you go hop off
on a quest? I'm talking to Penny here.

I think we're all talking to Penny here.

I'm not. No offense.

Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.

 Go away.
 All right, Kurt, be nice.

Oh, I am being nice.

Right, little buddy?

 Kurt.
 Okay.

I understand your impulse
to try to physically intimidate me.

You can't compete with me
on an intellectual level...

and so you're driven
to animalistic puffery.

You calling me a puffy animal?

Oh, of course not.

No, he's not. You're not, right, Leonard?

No, I said animalistic.

Of course, we're all animals...

but some of us have climbed
a little higher on the evolutionary tree.

If he understands that, you're in trouble.

So what? I'm unevolved?

You're in trouble.

You know, you use a lot of big words
for such a little dwarf.

Okay, Kurt, please.

Look, Penny, it's okay.

I can handle this.

I am not a dwarf, I'm a hobbit.

A hobbit.

Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus
preventing the conversion...

from short-term to long-term memory?


Okay, now you're starting
to make me mad.

A Homo habilis discovering
his opposable thumbs says, "What?"

 What?
 Ha-ha.

I think I've made my point.

Yeah? How about I make a point
out of your pointy little head?

Let me remind you, while my moral support
is absolute, in a physical confrontation...

I will be less than useless.

There's not going to be a confrontation.

In fact, I doubt
if he can even spell confrontation.

C-O-N...

Frontation.

 Kurt, put him down this instant.
 He started it.

I don't care, I'm finishing it.
Put him down.

Fine.

You're one lucky little leprechaun.

He's a hobbit.

I got your back.

Leonard, are you okay?

Yeah, no, I'm fine.

I can't afford you

It's a good party. Thanks for having...
It's just getting a little late, so...

Oh. Okay. All right.
Well, thank you for coming.

I had nothing to do with

Happy Halloween.

If it's any consolation...

I thought that Homo habilis line
really put him in his place.

 What's that?
 Tea.

When people are upset...

the cultural convention
is to bring them hot beverages.

There, there.

You wanna talk about it?

 No.
 Good.

"There, there" was really all I had.

 Good night, Sheldon.
 Good night, Leonard.


 Hey, Leonard?
 Hi, Penny.

Hey, I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

I'm fine.

I am so sorry about what happened.

It's not your fault.

Yes, it is.
That's why I broke up with him.

He always does stuff like that.

So why was he at your party?

Well, I ran into him last week...

and he was just all apologetic
about how he's changed.

He was just going on and on,
and I believed him.

And I'm an idiot,
because I always believe guys like that.

And I can't go back to my party
because he's there.

And I know you don't wanna hear this. I'm
upset and really drunk and I just wanna...


There, there.

God, what is wrong with me?

Nothing, you're perfect.

Ecch. I'm not perfect.

Yes, you are.

You really think so, don't you?

 Penny?
 Yeah?

How much have you had
to drink tonight?

Just... a lot.

Are you sure that your being drunk
and your being angry with Kurt...

doesn't have something to do
with what's going on here?

It might.


Boy, you're really smart.

Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.

Leonard, you are so great.

Why can't all guys be like you?

Because if all guys were like me,
the human race couldn't survive.

I should probably go.

Probably.

Thank you.

That's right, you saw what you saw.

That's how we roll in the Shire.


Coming.

Hey, have you seen Koothrappali?

He's not here.

Maybe the Avengers summoned him.

He's not the Marvel Comics Thor,
he's the original Norse god.

Thank you for the clarification.

 I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
 I'm sure he'll be fine.

He has his hammer.

Wow.

I have to say, you are an amazing man.

You're gentle and passionate.

And, my God,
you are such a good listener.



Okay, we've got power to the laser.

I should've brought an umbrella.

 What for? It's not gonna rain.
 I know.

But with skin as fair as mine,
moon burn is a real possibility.

That's a buzzinga, right?

One of my best, don't you think?

Howard, double-check
the equatorial mount on the laser.

 We need it locked on the Sea of Tranquility.
 You got it.

Raj, no.

Billions of dollars have gone
into inventing the Internet...

and filling it with pictures of naked women
so we don't have to peep through windows.

It's not like that.
I'm watching someone's TV.

The Good Wife is on.

I tell you,
this is my new Grey's Anatomy.

Leonard, what is that? What is that?

Relax, it's just a dirty sock.

How on earth can you say "dirty sock"
and "relax" in the same sentence?

Sheldon, the world is filled
with dirty, discarded socks.

Not my world.

You know who'd really dig
seeing this experiment? Penny.

I wasn't aware that lunar ranging
was her thing.

Although I suppose...

the retro reflector left on the moon
by Neil Armstrong...

does qualify as a shiny object.

Ask her to come up.

I don't know. It's still weird since,
you know...

 She dumped you?
 She didn't dump me.

We were just in different places
in the relationship.

I fail to see how a relationship...

can have the qualities
of a geographic location.

Well, it's very simple. Leonard was living
in a town called Please Don't Leave Me...

while Penny had just moved
to the island of Bye-bye.

Screw you, guys.
I'm gonna go see if she's home.

If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to point this at the moon now.

Wait a second.
The good wife is crying.

Something's very wrong.

Oh, hi. What's going on?

We're up on the roof
bouncing laser beams off the moon.

I'm sorry, what?

It's cool. We've got a two-meter
parabolic reflector and everything.

 I thought you might wanna see it.
 That makes no sense.

How can you bounce stuff off the moon?
There's no gravity.

Oh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.

 Hey.
 Sorry, I didn't know you were busy.

 Maybe another time.
 Yeah. Maybe.

 Hey, I wanna see this laser thing.
 Oh, what about the party?

It's a surprise party,
doesn't matter when we get there.

Right.

Okay, well, yeah, come on up.

So how'd you guys meet?

My company designs the menus
for The Cheesecake Factory.

Your company?

My dad, but me and my sister are VPs.

So menus.

It sounds easy, but there's a lot of science
that goes into designing them.

Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.

Thank you.

Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.

 Hey, guys. This is my friend Zack.
 Hey.

 Hello.
 Whoa, is that the laser? It's bitchen.

Yes. In 1917...

when Albert Einstein established
the theoretic foundation for the laser...

in his paper
Zur Quantentheorle der Strahlung...

his fondest hope was that
the resultant device be "bitchen."

Well, mission accomplished.

Let me explain what we're doing here.

In 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11...

positioned reflectors on the moon.

We're gonna shoot a laser
off one of them...

and let the light bounce back
into this photomultiplier.

Oh, that's very cool.

One question: How can you be sure
it won't blow up?

 The laser?
 The moon.

See, now this is a man for Penny.

 That's a great question, Zack.
 No, it's not.

 Sheldon, play nice.
 It's not a great question.

How could somebody possibly think
we're going to blow up the moon?

That's a great question.

Don't worry about the moon.
We set our laser to stun.

Smart.

We'll see the beam when it leaves. It won't
be strong enough when it comes back...

 ...to be seen by the naked eye.
 Naked. Heh, heh, heh.

Right, funny.

So that device there
will measure the photons that return...

and show it to us on this computer.
Raj, get them some glasses.

Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D?

Preparing to fire laser at the moon.

Make it so.

There it is. There's the spike.

Two-point-five seconds for the light to
return. That's the moon. We hit the moon.

That's your big experiment?
All that for a line on the screen?

Yeah, but think
about what this represents.

The fact that we can do this
is the only way of definitively proving...

that there are man-made objects
on the moon...

put there by a species
that only 60 years before...

had just invented the airplane.

What species is that?

I was wrong. Penny can do better.

 Okay, guys, thank you. It's been fun.
 Yeah, thanks.

 Should we invite them to the party?
 No, just keep walking.

He's must be very skilled at coitus.

I'm telling you, dude...

the only way to feel better
about Penny going out with other guys...

is for you to get back on the whores.

 Horse.
 What?

The phrase is "get back on the horse."
Not whores.

That's disgusting, dude.

No, it's not... Never mind.

He is right, though.

If you want, I can turn you on
to this great new dating site I found.

No, thanks.

You sure? They say
they can find a match for anybody.

 Have they found a match for you?
 Tons.

I've had, like, eight dates
in the last month.

Twelve, if you count the ones
who showed up and left.

 I can't bring the nitrogen tank down.
 Why not?

All right, let me restate that.
It's very heavy and I don't want to.

 I'll help you.
 Thank you.

Lift with your knees, not your back.

Good night.

You know what would be fun?

 Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
 Yeah, right.

No, think about it.
We make it an experiment.

Like when Frankenstein's monster
was lonely and he found a wife.

He didn't find a wife.

They built him a wife
out of dead body parts.

Okay, we'll call that plan B.

Coming.

Damn you, you rat bastard.

Are you drunk?

Zack was a perfectly nice guy
and then you ruined him.

How did I ruin him?

Because in the olden days,
I never would've known he was so stupid.

 Come on, he wasn't that stupid.
 Yes, he was.

He thought you were
gonna blow up the moon.

Okay, yeah, he's stupid. Heh, heh.

He spent the entire night...

bragging about how he invented
the word "appeteasers."

How is that my fault?

You have destroyed my ability
to tolerate idiots.

Now, come with me.

 Where are we going?
 We're gonna have sex.

Why? I mean, okay.

What's going on?

Put on your noise-canceling headphones,
because it's gonna get loud.

Ugh. Not this again.

In what universe is this "low-pulp"?

Good morning, Penny.

Do you have eyes
in the back of your head?

When one gets beaten up
every other day in school...

one, of necessity,
develops a keen sense of hearing.

Incidentally, one can get beaten up
in school...

simply
by referring to oneself as "one."

I'm making English muffins.
Would you like an English muffin?

Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.

FYI, my noise-canceling headphones
proved ineffective last night.

 Yeah, sorry about that.
 As a native Texan, I must say...

I've never heard the phrase "yeehaw"
used in quite that context.

Oh, God.

"Oh, God."

That I've heard on multiple occasions.

In what universe is that "lightly toasted"?

This has to be the worst day of my life.

Good morning, Leonard.

How many times
have I asked you not to do that?

Counting this instance?
Three hundred seventeen.

 Where's Penny?
 She returned to her apartment.

I presume to shower and vomit.

Not necessarily in that order.

Wonder why she didn't say goodbye.

Are you expecting me to offer
an explanation of human behavior?

I know. I thought as an outsider...

you might be able to provide
a fresh perspective.

Well, I have no difficulty
believing you are not butter.

 Oh, hey.
 Oh, hi.

 I gotta run. Early shift.
 Okay, I'll walk down with you.

So last night was fun, huh?

Yeah, it must've been.
I just threw up in my closet.

Bummer.

I was thinking tonight
maybe we could catch a movie.

Oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.

Doesn't have to be tonight.
I'm free pretty much always.

Leonard, last night was a mistake.

When you say "mistake,"
do you mean a fortunate mistake...

like the discovery of penicillin?

Look, I'm sorry.

I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack.

Can we just forget it ever happened?

No, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain.

Especially the whole rodeo thing.

Oh, God.

So that's it?
Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?

Look, I said I'm sorry.
Can't you please let it go?

How am I supposed to let it go?
You used me for sex.

Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.

Good morning, Leonard.
Or should I say "yeehaw"

 Holy crap.
 What?

We finally have proof...

 ...that aliens walk among us.
 Excuse me?

The dating site
matched a woman with Sheldon.

You're kidding. An actual woman?

Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.

Trust me, breasts doesn't
necessarily mean "woman."

 Since when?
 I'll show you a picture...

of my Uncle Louie
in a bathing suit sometime.

Leonard, you gotta see this.
We found a match for Sheldon.

Great. Maybe she can have sex with him
and walk out on him the next morning...

without so much
as a "How do you do?"

 Know what he's talking about?
 No. Ask him.

 Leonard, what?
 I don't wanna talk about it.

That was a lousy suggestion.

Whatever.

Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper
has to send an e-mail to his perfect match.

"Greetings, fellow life-form..."

If she can do it, I can do it.
If she can do it, I can do it.

If she can do it, I can do it.

I can't do it.

 Hello?
 Oh, hi. Hey.

Hi, Leslie.

Leonard, what're you doing here?

I know. It's been a while.

Yeah, 18 months.

Right. Right.

So how you doing?

 Fine. You?
 Not bad.

You remember
when we used to have sex...

and you said it didn't mean anything,
it was just for fun?

Yeah.

Do you wanna do that again?

What happened? Blondie dumped you?

She didn't dump me. We were
just in different places in the relationship.

Right.

Anyway, apparently, it's okay to go back
to people you're no longer seeing...

 ...and have recreational sex with them.
 Uh-huh.

So, what do you say?

Let me think about it.

She's not coming back.

 Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
 Not us. Him.

Yes, but "him"
doesn't even know about "her."

Well, "him" about to find out about "her."

Really? Us gonna tell him?

Who's going to tell whom about what?

Sheldon. Hey. Hi.

Your surprise confuses me. I live here.

Right.

So, listen, what are you doing
tomorrow afternoon?

 Be more specific.
 Four-thirty.

That's not afternoon. That's preevning.

 What?
 It's a time of day I invented.

It better defines the ambiguous period...

between afternoon and evening:
preevning.

Fairly certain it will catch on
as it fills a desperate need.

Right, okay. What are you doing
tomorrow preevning?

Well, tomorrow's Saturday.
Saturday night is laundry night.

So I'll be spending the preevning
pre-sorting and pre-soaking.

Okay, what if I were to tell you...

tomorrow at 4:30,
you could meet a woman...

who has been scientifically chosen
to be your perfect mate?

I would snort in derision
and throw my arms in the air...

exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.

But it's true.

We put all your vital information
into this dating site...

answered all questions like you would
and they found a match for you.

 Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
 Please.

Even assuming you could answer
any question the way I would...

the algorithms used
by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.

That's the answer
we gave to the question.

"What is your attitude
towards online dating?"

Well, Howard wanted to write
"mumbo jumbo," but I said no.

Our Sheldon would say "hokum."

Come on,
where's your scientific curiosity?

Most of it is being applied to unraveling
secrets of universe...

while the rest of it is wondering why
I'm having this conversation with you.

Okay, how about this?

Even Spock had a date
once every seven years,

He didn't date. It was pon farr.

His blood boiled with mating lust.

Why don't you start
with a cup of coffee...

and you can pon farr
Amy Farrah Fowler later.

 I don't drink coffee.
 All right, you can have a hot chocolate.

As I will not be engaging in this nonsense,
my choice of beverage is moot.

For the record,
I only drink hot chocolate...

in months with an R in them.

 Why?
 What's life without whimsy?

Okay, I'm out.

Sheldon...

I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof
somewhere in your apartment.

Unless you're willing
to come with us to meet this girl...

it will remain there forever.

You're bluffing.

Are you willing to risk it?

Curse you.

Thirty feet.

Oh. Hey, Leonard.

I was a perfectly happy,
geeky, little lonely guy...

and then you ruined me.

Are you drunk?

Come on. We're gonna have sex
and it's not gonna mean a thing.

Are you out of your mind?

I'm really starting to think
there's a double standard here.

In a few minutes, when I gloat
over the failure of this enterprise...

how would you prefer I do it?
The standard "I told you so"?

With a classic "neener-neener"?

Or just my normal look
of haughty derision?

 You don't know we're wrong yet.
 Haughty derision it is.

Excuse me. I'm Amy Farrah Fowler.
You're Sheldon Cooper.

Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler.

I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been taken in...

by unsupportable mathematics...

designed to prey
on the gullible and the lonely.

Additionally, I'm being blackmailed
with a hidden dirty sock.

If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it.

If it was literal,
I share your aversion to soiled hosiery.

I'm here because my mother and I have
agreed that I will date at least once a year.

Interesting.

My mother and I have
the same agreement about church.

I don't object to the concept of a deity,
but I'm baffled by the notion...

of one that takes attendance.

Well, then you might
want to avoid East Texas.

Noted. Now, before this goes any further,
you should know...

that all forms of physical contact
up to and including coitus are off the table.

May I buy you a beverage?

Tepid water, please.

Good God, what have we done?



So I got the craziest e-mail
this morning.

I don't mean to burst your bubble,
but penile-enlargement pills do not work.

Believe me, I know.

The e-mail I got was from the office
of Stephen Hawking.

 You're kidding.
 Why?

He's coming to the university
to lecture...

and he's looking for an engineer to
maintain equipment on his wheelchair.

That's amazing.
You'll be like his pit crew.

A word of caution, I would not do
your Stephen Hawking impression...

in front of him.

You're right.


that could be considered offensive.

Oh, boy.
Oh, Sheldon's going to freak out.

Yeah, he worships Hawking.

I was thinking about bringing him along,
so he can meet the great man.

 That's really nice of you, Howard.
 Lt's no big deal.

Boy, a restraining order
from Stephen Hawking.

It'll look so nice
next to the ones he's got...

from Leonard Nimoy,
Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.

Leonard, do you recall when I said
that I was going...

to revolutionize understanding
of the Higgs boson particle...

and you said, "Sheldon, it's 2 a.m.
Get out of my bedroom"?

Like it was 10 hours ago.
What about it?

Well, I believe I've done it.

I'm only saying "believe"
to sound modest...

because, sweet Sam Houston,
I did it.

 Really?
 That's incredible. Oh, here.

 Break out the math.
 Oh, okay. Let me see this.

All right, so this particle here
is the boson moving forward in time.

Now, I was thinking...

Howard, you go ahead and eat.
This isn't gonna make any sense to you.

Sheldon, I have a working understanding
of physics.

Yeah, good for you.
And don't stop working on it.

You still going to tell him...

 ...about you-know-who?
 Yep.

 Still gonna introduce him?
 Not on your life.

Please, please, please.
Let me meet Hawking.

 I told you no.
 But I said I'm sorry.

No, you said,
"Would it help if I said 'I'm sorry'?"

Well, and you never answered me.

So who owes whom an apology now?

Sheldon, you're a condescending jerk.

Why on earth would I want
to do something nice for you?

To go to Jewish heaven?

Jews don't have heaven.

Well, then, to avoid Jewish hell?

Have you met my mother?
I live in Jewish hell.

Howard, please.
This is Stephen Hawking.

Perhaps my only intellectual equal.

You can't be serious.

Try to put yourself in my place.

Imagine you're the sole human being...

living on a planet
populated with nothing but dogs.

And then it turns out
there's another human being.

Hang on.
Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?

I can see you're gonna
take this the wrong way.

Let me try again.

Imagine
you're the sole human being...

living on a planet
populated with nothing but chimps.

Get out of my lab.

Oh, now,
they're so much smarter than dogs.

Have you seen them
on those little bicycles?

Get out!

 How about dolphins?
 Out!

So come on,
how was the first day with Hawking?

It was great. We talked about movies.

Oh.

 I showed him some card tricks.
 Oh.

He even let me read a couple pages
from his new book.

Oh...

Something got you down there,
bunky?

Howard, please, I'm begging you.

Raj, you're our group historian.
Has Sheldon ever begged before?

Three times.

He begged the Fox network
not to cancel Firefly.

He begged the TNT network
to cancel Babylon 5.

And when he got food poisoning
at the Rose Bowl parade...

he begged a deity he doesn't believe in
to end his life quickly.

Do you understand
how important Hawking is to me?

When I was 6 years old,
I dressed up as him for Halloween.

 You're kidding.
 No, sir.

No, I took my dad's desk chair,
attached a Speak & Spell to it...

and made my sister push me up
and down the block to trick-or-treat.

Granted, most people thought I was
R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.

You don't seem to be understanding
the English word "no."

Maybe a different language will help.

Russian: Nyet. Chinese: Bú.
Japanese: Lie. Klingon: Qo'.

Binary coded ASCII:
0110111001101111.

 It's actually 011011110...
 No!

I'm not asking for me.

I'm asking for Hawking.


Okay, look. How about this?

You just give him my paper
on the Higgs boson.

If he sees the breakthrough I've made,
he'll reach out to me.

 What if he doesn't?
 Yeah, he will. He's really smart.

That's an interesting idea.

Why don't you give me a minute
to talk it over with my friends?

 How?
 Walk away.

Walking away!

You do realize
you own his ass right now.

I do.

You can make him
do anything you want.

Yeah, I know. I'm just trying to figure out
how much I wanna punish him.

Well, don't be too mean.

Hey, I'm thinking about making...

freshly brewed iced tea
if anyone would like some.

 I wouldn't mind a glass.
 I wasn't talking to you.

Bring him to his bony knees.

Sheldon, come on back.

Yes, yes!

What did you decide?

I'll give your paper to Hawking.

Great. Thank you. Oh, that's terrific.

But in exchange,
I'd like you to do a few things for me.

What kinds of things?

Are you familiar
with the 12 labors of Hercules?

Of course.

You should be so lucky.

All right.
What would you like me to do first?

Well, I thought I'd start you off
by polishing my belt buckles.

By all means. Yeah, when I was a boy,
I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver.

And she would entertain me with stories
about growing up in Oklahoma.

Interesting woman.

You know, she once killed a prairie dog
with a gravy boat.

That's nice.

Whew. Heh.

That's a lot of belt buckles.

Funny thing is I only have one belt.

Anyway, I'll let you get started.

Oh, by the way, the little marks
that look like water spots...

I tend to stand too close
to the urinal, so...

What you're seeing there
is splash-back.

You make sissy on your belt buckles?

Mee-Maw's forks never had that.

Here is a black light to check them.
For your own peace of mind...

you might not wanna shine that
around the rest of the room.

Sheldon, these look great.

I mean,
they're like magnificent little crowns...

to hang
over my magnificent little jewels.

How did you get them so shiny?

Oh, I buffed them with Turtle wax.

The man down at Pep Boys
says from now on...

the urine should just bead up
and roll right off.

Way to go the extra mile.
Your Mee-Maw would be proud.

My Mee-Maw
must never know of this.

Now will you give
Professor Hawking my paper?

Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay.

Next, this is a sexy French maid
costume I bought for Bernadette.

I thought it might spice things up...

and get her to dust my room
at the same time, heh...

but I was wrong and really wrong.

You want me to return it for you?

No, no, no, ma petite chérie.

What are you all staring at?

You ever seen a man try to get
a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?


 Hey.
 Hello.

It's not Saturday night.
Why are you doing your laundry?

This is not my laundry.

Wow, are these Amy's?
Kind of trashy. Good for her.

 Those are Howard's.
 Eww.

Why are you washing
Howard's man-panties?

Because if I don't,
he won't give my paper to Stephen Hawking.

 He's a famous physicist...
 Yeah.

I know. He's the wheelchair dude
who invented time.

Close enough.

Why doesn't Howard
just introduce you to the guy?

Because he's punishing me
for being a, quote, "condescending jerk."

You don't think I'm condescending,
do you?

 Well...
 Oh, I'm sorry.

 Condescending means...
 I know what it means!

And, yes, you love correcting people
and putting them down.

Au contraire, when I correct people,
I am raising them up.

You should know.
I do it for you more than anyone.

Come on, you do it to feel superior.

I see that twinkle when someone
says "who" instead of "whom"...

or thinks the moon is a planet.

Or Don Quixote is a book
about a donkey named Hotay.

See? There it is. There's that twinkle.

Well, I can't help it.
That's an involuntary twinkle.

What do you want me to tell you,
Sheldon?

I want you to tell me
that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.

Fine. Howard is being mean to you
for no reason.

I knew it.


 What's the matter?
 Every time I spend the night...

your mom slaps me on the behind
and says, "Go get 'em."

it's not her fault.
She's getting hormone-replacement therapy.

Makes her crazy horny.

Check this out. I got Sheldon
to wear the French maid's costume.

My God, that's terrible.

What?
Hey, I gave you first crack at it.

Why are you doing that?
You're being mean to him.

He's mean all the time.

You've heard him tease me
about not having a doctorate.

You don't wanna get teased about that,
get a doctorate.

I have one. They're great.

Come on. The man torments me.

I'm letting him have a little taste
of his own medicine.

It's not the same. Sheldon doesn't know
he's being mean. The part of his brain...

that should know is getting a wedgie
from the rest of his brain.

Fine. I'll just make him do
a couple more things, then I'll stop.

No, you have to stop now.

Bernadette!

I wanna remind you, you promised
to take me dress-shopping tomorrow!

Oh, damn.

I'm sorry, I can't make it!

But Sheldon's gonna go with you!

And that's the last thing
you do to him.

Sheldon!

I need your help.

What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?

It's this dress.

When I put my front in,
my back pops out.

When I put my back in,
my front pops out.

It's like trying to keep two dogs
in a bathtub.

What do you want me to do?

We're gonna have to work as a team.

Get in here, grab a handful,
and start stuffing.

I'm not sure how to do this.

you're putting away a sleeping bag.

sweat this much, but okay.

Now zip me up.

you might turn into a diamond.

You're right.

Who am I kidding?

You should've seen me
when I was young, Sheldon.

The fellas used to line up
and bring me boxes of candy.


Why did I eat it all?

Would you hold me?

Oh. No, you know,
I'm not really the holding kind of...

Oh!

Oh, guys, I just remembered.

I got you some Hawking souvenirs.

What are these?

Gears and springs
from his wheelchair.

Pretty cool, huh?


Wow. That's amazing.

Yeah, I made an adjustment
on the motor drive...

and when I was putting it
back together...

I could not for the life of me
figure out where they went.

I did it.

Had to go to three clothing stores...

but we finally found a dress
that could envelop your mother.

I should have sent you to the custom
car cover place in Altadena.

They have her pattern on file.

Ha-ha. Humorous.

Now, will you please present
my paper to Professor Hawking?

 I don't know.
 Oh, for heaven's sake.

I did your laundry.
I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles.

I even sprained my wrist
helping your mother lift her bosom.

All right, Sheldon. There's only
one thing left I want you to do.

 Don't worry, it's an easy one.
 Okay.

Give me a compliment.

Fine.

You have very tiny hands.

No. About my job.

I want you to tell me
I'm good at what I do.

You're obviously good
at what you do.

Well, then, why are you always ripping
on me?

Oh, I understand the confusion.

No. I have never said
that you are not good at what you do.

It's just that what you do
is not worth doing.

It's nicer than anything
he's ever said to me. I'd take it and run.

Thank you, Sheldon.

Will you give my paper to Hawking?

 Sorry, I can't.
 What? Why not?

I gave it to him three days ago.

He was really impressed.

He wants to meet you.

All right, then.

Thank you, Howard.

Please let Professor Hawking know...

that I'm available
at his earliest convenience.

 Thought he might be more excited.
 Give it a second.


Professor Hawking, it's an honor
and a privilege to meet you, sir.


I know.

for taking time to see me.


My pleasure.

I enjoyed reading your paper
very much.

You clearly have a brilliant mind.

I know.


Your thesis that the Higgs boson
is a black hole...

accelerating backwards
through time is fascinating.

one morning in the shower.


That's nice.

Too bad it's wrong.

What do you mean, "Wrong"?


You made an arithmetic mistake
on page two.

It was quite the boner.


I don't make arithmetic mistakes.

Are you saying I do?

Oh, no. No, no, of course not.

Oh, gosh, golly. I made a boo-boo.

And I gave it to Stephen Hawking.


Great. Another fainter.



Goin' out tonight

I'm feelin' all right

Gonna let It all hang out

Wanna make some noise

Really raise my voice

Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

Unh! No...

Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.

No.

Why not?

Penny, while I subscribe
to the Many-Worlds theory...

which posits the existence of infinite
Sheldons in an infinite number...

of universes, I assure you
that none of them am I dancing.

Are you fun in any of them?

The math would suggest that in a few,
I'm a clown made of candy.

But I don't dance.

 All right, want some French toast?
 It's oatmeal day.

Tell you what, next French toast day,
I will make you oatmeal.

Dear Lord, are you still going
to be here on French toast day?

Morning.

Look, Leonard,
Penny made French toast.

Sorry, I haven't given her
your schedule yet.

It's an iCal download.
She can put it right in her phone.

And we agreed you'd have
conjugal visits in her apartment.

We did, but there
were extenuating circumstances.

I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping
skills finally trump her perkiness?

No, her bed kind of broke.

That doesn't seem likely.
Her bed's of sturdy construction.

Even the addition
of a second normal-sized human...

wouldn't cause a structural failure,
much less a homunculus such as yourself.

A homunculus?

Perfectly formed miniature human being.

Oh, you're my little homunculus.

Don't do that.

Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup
and who wants cinnamon sugar?

 I want oatmeal.
 Yes, well...

I want a boyfriend whose roommate
isn't a giant pain in the ass.

 Ha, ha.
 I'm sure that will happen soon enough.

But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.

You know what? I give up.
He's impossible.

I can't be impossible, I exist.

I believe what you meant to say is,
"I give up. He's improbable."

Sheldon, you need to find
a better way of dealing with Penny.

What am I supposed to do?

Eat French toast on a Monday?
Now, that would be impossible.

I'm saying you can catch more flies
with honey than vinegar.

You can catch even more flies
with manure. What's your point?

It's a...

Boy, that does smell good.

Too bad it's Monday.

Kim, the night manager,
went on maternity leave...

and her husband's name is Sandy.

So get this, her replacement
is a woman named Sandy...

whose husband's name is Kim.

 Wow.
 I know. What are the odds? Oh.

Easily calculable. We begin by identifying
the set of couples with unisex names.

We eliminate those unqualified
for restaurant work:

the aged, the imprisoned
and the limbless, for example.

 Next, we look at the...
 Sheldon.

It's an amazing coincidence.
Can we leave it at that?

I'm sorry.

Oh, Penny, it's as if the Cheesecake
Factory is run by witches.

Oh, Sheldon, it's as if you don't think
I'll punch you.

Come on, you guys. Let it go.

Fine, whatever.

Are you finished?

Well, thank you. How thoughtful.

Would you like a chocolate?

Um, yeah, sure.

Thanks.

What was that?

You said be nice to Penny.

I believe offering chocolate to someone
falls within the definition of "nice."

It does. But in my experience, you don't.

There are more things in heaven
and Earth, Horatio...

than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

Yeah, now, that's you.
Obnoxious and insufferable.

What's going on, day dwellers?

Oh, man, did the KISS Army repeal
"Don't ask, don't tell"?

No. Raj and I are going to a goth club
in Hollywood...

to hang with the night people.

Wanna come along?

Oh, wow, you're actually going out
like that?

No, ha, ha. No. I'm going out like this.

Howard, what did you do?

They're called tattoo sleeves. Look.

Yeah, I bought them online.
Raj got a set too.

Fantastic, right?

Put them on, have sex with some girl
with her business pierced...

take them off, and I can still be buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

You know, I've always wanted
to go to a goth nightclub.

 Really?
 Buzzinga.

None of you ever see
my practical jokes coming, do you?

Okay, how about you two?
Look, I got some extra tat sleeves.

Why are you carrying extras?

In case I snag one
on someone's nipple ring.

Yeah, I think we'll pass.

Oh, is the missus speaking
for the couple now?

In this case, you bet she is.

Ahh. Yes, she's pushy and, yes,
he's whipped, but that's not the expression.

Come on, I wanna stop at Walgreens
and pick up some more eyeliner.

They're gonna get beaten up at that club.

They're gonna get beaten up
at Walgreens.

Oh, sorry, Sheldon.
I almost sat in your spot.

Did you? I didn't notice.

Have a chocolate.

Thank you.

I think we're fitting in quite nicely.

It'd help
if you weren't drinking light beer.

Well, what's so gothic
about vodka and cranberry juice?

Hello? It looks like blood.

Did you even read the wikiHow link
I sent you on being goth?

No, I'm behind on my wiki reading.

I'm kind of on a John Grisham kick
right now.

 What?
 I finished reading The Pelican Brief...

and loved it so much,
I dived right into The Client.

He was a lawyer himself, so his novels
are accurate as well as entertaining.

Just remember, we are lost boys.
Children of the night.

Great. Lost boys, children of the night.
Got it.

Can you pass the Chex Mix, please?

Thank you.

We are lost boys.

Good for you.

I'm actually much more lost than he is.

Nice ink.

Thanks.
Can we buy you ladies a drink?

Two light beers.

Light beers. Well, wikiHow about that?

What's your names?

 I'm Howard.
 Raj.

 I'm Bethany.
 Nice to meet you, Bethany.

Yes, very nice.

Nice to meet you too.

I'm Sarah. Not that anyone cares.

Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels
of John Grisham?

What's this cartoon called again?

Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.

And it's not a cartoon, it's anime.

Anime. You know, I knew a girl
in high school named Anna May.

Anna May Fletcher.

She was born with one nostril.

Then she had this bad nose job
and basically wound up with three.

You're here a lot now.

Oh, am I talking too much? I'm sorry. Zip.

 Thank you.
 Mm-hm.

Chocolate?

Yes, please.

 Oh. Hey, Kim.
 Ahh.

Yeah, I...

You know what? Hold on.
Let me take this in the hall.

Chocolate?

Thank you.

You'll never guess who they got
to replace you at work.

Okay.

I know what you're doing.

Really?

Yes. You're using chocolates
as positive reinforcement...

for what you consider correct behavior.

Very good.

 Chocolate?
 No, I don't want any chocolate.

Sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend
like a lab rat.

Actually, it turns out I can.

Well, you shouldn't.

Oh, ugh.
There's just no pleasing you, is there?

You weren't happy
with my approach with her...

so I decided to employ operant
conditioning techniques...

building on the works of Thorndike
and B.F. Skinner.

Next week, I believe
I can have her jumping out of a pool...

balancing a beach ball on her nose.

No, this has to stop now.

I'm not suggesting we really make her
jump out of a pool.

I thought the "buzzinga" was implied.

I'm just tweaking her personality,
sanding off the rough edges, if you will.

No, you're not sanding Penny.

Are you saying that I am forbidden
from applying a harmless...

scientifically valid protocol
that will make our lives better?

Yes, you're forbidden.

Bad Leonard.

So, what do you guys do?

Oh, you know, goth stuff.
Goth magazines, goth music.

Goth food.

What's goth food?

Uh... Blackened salmon?

No, I meant, what do you do for jobs?

 Oh, we're scientists.
 Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.

What are the dark sciences?

Well, I am an astrophysicist,
and a lot of that takes place at night.

When there are vampires
and miscellaneous undead out and about.

That sounds really cool.

Does it?
Well, okay, if you like space stuff...

I designed components
for the space station. Which is in space.

Where, as I'm sure you know,
no one can hear you scream.

So, what do you gals do?

I work at the Gap.

Really? How about that?
I've been to the Gap.

I've been there as well.
I like your T-shirts with the little pocket.

I work there too.

Not that anyone cares.

You know, this place is boring.

Yeah. Why don't we go somewhere else
and have some fun?

 Okay.
 Sure. We like fun.

We are fun people.

Uh, dark and fun.

Come on. I know a place you'll really dig.

 Did you bring the black condoms?
 In my fanny pack.

Let's go.

Are you happy now?

Not particularly.

Oh, my God, she didn't.

What could she possibly be talking
about for so long?

Obviously, waitressing
at the Cheesecake Factory...

is a complex socio-economic activity...

that requires a great deal
of analysis and planning.

Buzzinga.

You know, using positive
reinforcement techniques...

I could train that behavior out of her
in a week.

 No.
 If you let me use negative reinforcement...

I can get it done before we go to bed.

You're not squirting her in the face
with water.

No, of course not.

We're talking very mild electric shocks.

No tissue damage whatsoever.

 Forget it.
 Oh, come on.

You can't tell me
that you're not intrigued...

about the possibility
of building a better girlfriend.

I'm not.

Penny's qualities, both good and bad,
are what make her who she is.

You mean like that
high-pitched irritating laugh?

Yes.

You wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?

You're not changing how Penny laughs.

No, that would be incongruous.

I was going to lower the whole voice
to a more pleasing register.

Ugh, sorry, guys.

That girl is freaky.

 Come again?
 Freaky.

 Freaky?
 Yeah, freaky.

Have a chocolate.

Thank you.

Are you seriously
going to deface your body...

just on the possibility you could have
cheap sex with a girl you met in a bar?

Uh, yeah.

What is your mother going to say?

She's not gonna see it.

She takes my temperature orally now.

What are you gonna get?

Well, I can't really decide
between a screaming devil...

this mean little skull,
or Kermit the Frog.

 Kermit the Frog?
 You know:

"Heigh-ho, I'm on Howard's butt."

Get the mean little skull,
and I'll see if I can make him smile.

Yeah, I'd like the mean little skull, please.

What are you gonna get, Raj?

With my luck, hepatitis.

Okay, here we go.

Ow, ow, ow.

That's just rubbing alcohol.

I know, but it was cold.

Ow, ow, ow.

I'm putting on the stencil.

 What comes after the stencil?
 This:

Aah! Okay, that's it. No needle.
No pain. No tattoo.

What's the big deal?
You've done this before.

No, I haven't. Look.

 I'm sorry. I'm a fraud. He's a fraud.
 We're both frauds.

 Yeah, I think I covered that.
 Well, I was summing up.

We're not goth. We're just guys.

Very, very smart guys.

So you were totally scamming us?

Yes.

And I wouldn't blame you
if you walked out of here...

and never wanted to see us again.

Unless, of course, our bold honesty
has suddenly made us attractive.

Huh? Huh? Anything?

I'm leaving.

I'm leaving too.

Not that anyone cares.

When we tell this story,
let's end it differently.

What are you thinking,
maybe a big musical number?

Well, I'm going to make some warm milk
and then turn in.

I trust if you two are planning
on engaging in amorous activities...

you'll keep the decibel level
to a minimum.

Of course.

Thank you.

Mm. These are so good. Mm.

Unbelievable.

 What?
 I was just thinking...

we should probably turn in too.

Well, my new bed got delivered.

If you put it together,
you can stay at my place.

Really? That's a lot of work, and it's late.

Yeah, but we won't have to be quiet.

Let's go.

Interesting.

Sex works even better than chocolate
to modify behavior.

I wonder if anyone else
has stumbled onto that.

Okay, wait, how about this?

We say there were four goth girls.

The two girls in the club had two friends.

I like it, I like it.

Did they smell good
despite their goth-like nature?

 What's that gotta do with the story?
 Engaging my olfactory sense...

 ...helps make it real for me.
 Fine, they smelled good.

Oh, they did.
Like jasmine and honeysuckle.

 Whatever.
 And they held hands...

and did a sexy demonic hokey-pokey
for us.

No. Let me say my story all the way,
and then you can say yours...

 ...then we'll pick.
 I'm sorry. Go on.

We got tattoos, and then the four girls
took us to their place.

We don't have tattoos. What if someone
asks to see our tattoos?

We say they're in a very intimate area.

Oh, we are bad boys, aren't we?

 Right. Right.
 Yeah. Ha, ha.

So we go back to their place,
and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.

But we just got tattoos. Wouldn't we be
concerned about bacterial infection?

True. Okay, forget the hot tub.

The point is, we each had a m�nage
with sexy goth girls.

Wow.

What a great night.

Yeah.

Hey, wanna try a country bar
tomorrow night?

Yeah, maybe we'll get lucky
with sexy cowgirls.

 Could happen.
 Ha, ha.

I wonder how they smell.



This movie baffles me
every time we watch it.

What do you mean?

The instructions are very clear.
Don't feed the gremlins after midnight.

Don't get the gremlins wet.

How hard is that?

Hi, guys.

 Hi, honey.
 Hey.

Oh, we're "honey" now, are we?

Yes. Since their relationship
became carnal...

Penny has upgraded
his designated term of endearment...

distinguishing him
from those she calls "sweetie"...

in an attempt to soften
a thinly veiled insult.

You're boring people, sweetie.

Although sometimes
she omits the veil entirely.

 So, what are you guys doing?
 Celebrating Columbus Day.

We're watching Goonies, Gremlins
and Young Sherlock Holmes.

They're all written by Chris Columbus.

Okay. What do you watch
on Thanksgiving?

The parade.

That reminds me. I usually go back
to Nebraska for Thanksgiving.

This year, they're calling it off
on account of my brother's trial.

 What's he on trial for?
 Oh, just a big misunderstanding.

You know, you'd like my brother.
He's kind of a chemist.

I was thinking
I'd have Thanksgiving here.

 And you are all invited.
 Oh, I'll be there.

Will you be serving cranberry jelly
or cranberry sauce?

I guess I could serve both.

You guess? You don't seem
to have much of a handle on this.

Yeah, I really wish I could,
Penny, but every year...

my mother has all the relatives over
and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.

Tur-briska-fil?

A turkey stuffed with a brisket
stuffed with gefilte fish.

It's not as good as it sounds.

Raj, what about you?

Oh, he usually comes
to my house. Right, pal?

Uh, all right. This year,
you don't have to eat the tur-briska-fil.

I don't even chew it.
I swallow it like pills.

So, what's going on with Raj?

Well, the good news
is he has no problem...

with my mother's tur-briska-fil.

Hard to believe, but go on.

The bad news
is he says he's getting deported.

What do you mean
he's getting deported?

I believe it means the U.S. government
is going to expel him from the country.

He could return to India, immigrate to
another country willing to accept him...

or wander the high seas
as a stateless pirate.

Personally, I'd choose pirate.

Penny, would you mind stepping outside
so we can speak to him?

Ugh. Fine, but the man really needs to work
on his girl issues.

Another reason
to consider a life of piracy.

Even today, I understand
that's an all-male profession.

Okay, she's gone.

Sorry I lost my cool.

So, what's going on?

Okay, here's the deal.

Six months ago, my research
testing the predicted composition...

of trans-Neptunian objects
ran into a dead end.

So?

My visa is only good as long
as I'm employed at the university.

When they find out I've got squat,
they're gonna cut me off.

By the way, when I say "squat,"
I mean "diddlysquat."

I wish I had squat.

Wait. What have you been doing
for the past six months?

You know, checking e-mail...

updating my Facebook status...

messing up Wikipedia entries.

Did you know Netflix lets you
stream movies on your computer now?

You've continued to take the university's
money under false pretenses?

Highly unethical for an astrophysicist.

Although, practically mandatory
for a pirate.

I don't wanna go back to India.
It's hot and loud.

And there's so many people.

You have no idea. They're everywhere.

Okay, guys, think.
How do we keep Raj in the country?

Why doesn't he just get another job?

What are you asking me for?
I don't know if you can talk now or not.

Oh, beef.

I'm gonna miss you so much.

Did you know at the Mumbai McDonald's,
you can't get a Big Mac?

All you can get
is a Chicken Maharaja Mac.

And the special sauce?

Curry. Which in India,
believe you me, is really not that special.

 Don't worry. You'll find another job.
 Yeah, let me start practicing for it.

"Do you want fries
with that Maharaja Mac?"

Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.

Hello, Sheldon.

Forgive me.
I'm not adept at reading facial cues.

But I'm going to take a stab here.
You're either sad or nauseated.

 I'm sad.
 I was going to say sad.

I don't know why I hedged.

What are you eating?

Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger
and tomato sauce.

Oh, beefaroni.

I think I'll miss you most of all.

I've always been a little confused
about this. Why don't Hindus eat beef?

 We believe cows are gods.
 Not technically.

In Hinduism,
cattle are thought to be like God.

Do not tell me about my culture.
I'll take you out, I swear to cow.

I'm sorry.

Me too. I'm just... I'm a little on edge.

Mm, understandable. Your life seems
to be crumbling around you...

and your future appears bleak at best.

Thank you.

And you're wrong
about Hinduism and cows.

Hey, Raj, Professor Laughlin
is looking for someone to join...

 ...the stellar evolution research team.
 You're kidding. That's fantastic.

 Call him and set up an interview.
 I'm on it.

 That's happy, right?
 Yeah.

Nailed it.

Dr. Koothrappali, come on in.

I was surprised to hear you're interested
in joining our team.

Giving up on those
trans-Neptunian objects, are we?

No, no. It's a very promising area.

In a perfect world,
I'd spend several more years on it.

I couldn't pass up the opportunity
to work with you...

on your tremendously exciting and
not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.

Splendid. Please sit down.

Can I offer you a sherry?

It's a little early, isn't it?

Not on Proxima Centauri. Ha, ha.

Oh, that's very good.

Jolly amusing. But if you don't mind,
I'll hold off until sunset on Titan.

Ha, ha. Well done. I have a feeling
you're going to fit in fine, Dr. Koothrappali.

Thank you, sir.

I'm sorry. Am I late?

No, no. Right on time.

Dr. Koothrappali,
may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT.

She'll be heading up
our data analysis team.

It's nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali.

I read your paper on Kuiper Belt
object-size distribution.

I really enjoyed it.

How did you correct
for the selection bias?

Well, I ran a simulation.

Allowed me to correct
for the observational efficiency.

 Oh. That's just fascinating.
 Thank you.

Would you like to hear more about it
at my hot tub?

So when do I start?

You didn't get the job?
How could you not get it?

You know, he's British, I'm Indian.

Ever since Gandhi,
they haven't liked us very much.

Are you saying that he discriminated
against you? We should file a complaint.

That's okay. Complaint's been filed.

So that's it.

That was my last hope.

I'm gonna be deported.
Sent home in disgrace.

Exposed to the sardonic barbs
of my cousin Sanjay.

Or as you may know him,
Dave from AT&T Customer Service.

 I'm really gonna miss you.
 Will you come visit me in India?

Gee, that's like a 17-hour flight.

How about I meet you halfway?

Halfway is 600 miles
off the coast of Japan.

Tell you what, we'll Skype.

 Gentlemen.
 Hey.

Raj, did you get the job
with Professor Laughlin?

 No.
 I assumed as much, but never fear.

Like the subordinate male protagonist
in action movies who disappears...

halfway through the second reel,
I have returned to save the day.

Odd. Usually he's met by cheers.

Anyway, I was thinking about exploring
the string theory implications...

of gamma rays
from dark-matter annihilations.

 It occurred to me that I could...
 Excuse me.

How many reels before the subordinate
male protagonist gets to his point?

If you didn't cheer at my entrance,
it's too late to buy into the premise.

Anyway, I got some extra money
from the head of the department...

and Raj can come work for me.

You want me to work with you?

For me.

You're going to have to listen
more carefully when you're on the job.

Okay. Please don't take this
the wrong way...

but I'd rather swim buck naked
across the Ganges...

with a paper cut on my nipple...

and die a slow, agonizing death
from a viral infection...

than work with you.

For me.

Sheldon, are you busy?

Of course I'm busy.

 Shall I wait?
 Yes, please.

How may I help you?

I've reconsidered your offer
to let me work with you.

For me.

Yes, for you.

I do, however, have a few conditions.

First, at all times, I am to be treated
as a colleague and an equal.

Second, my contributions shall be noted
in published materials.

Third, you are never allowed to lecture me
on Hinduism or my Indian culture.

I'm impressed, Raj.

Those are very cogent
and reasonable conditions.

 Thank you.
 I reject them all.

Then you leave me no choice.

I accept the job.

I'm sorry.
I believe you've misunderstood.

I'm not giving you the job.

I'm simply affording you the opportunity
to apply for it.

Have a seat.
We'll get started with the interview.

You're kidding.

Please.

All right.

So...

That's what you wear to an interview?

Come on, we've been friends for years.

Oh, pulling strings, are we?

Sheldon, for God's sakes,
don't make me beg.

Buzzinga.

You've fallen victim to another one
of my classic practical jokes.

I'm your boss now.
You may wanna laugh at that.

Ah. This is nice,
having the place to ourselves, isn't it?

Uh-huh.

Now that Raj is working for Sheldon,
I don't have to chauffeur him around.

Plus, yeah, with them working late
so much, we get some privacy.

Mm-hm.

Hey.

Wanna get a little crazy?

What are you thinking?

Let's slide over to Sheldon's spot
and make out.

You are a dirty girl.

Oh, God, how did he know?

Hello?

 Hi, Howard.
 Heh.

Am I interrupting?

Little bit, yeah.

Guess I should've called.

Yeah, maybe.

Tonight's the night I usually go
line dancing with Raj at the Palomino.

Uh-huh.

But he's working with Sheldon.

 Yes. We know.
 Hoo.

Want me to leave?

You know, whatever.

I guess I can hang for a little while.

So, what are we watching?

Sex and the City, yikes.

Hey, I happen to love this movie.

Fine. Let's watch it.

Maybe all our periods will synchronize.

We're going to be
designing an experiment...

to look for the annihilation spectrum
resulting from dark-matter collisions.

Ooh, dark matter.
We better bring a flashlight, ha, ha.

I was making a joke.

I'm the boss. I make the jokes.

Sorry. Go ahead and make your joke.

This is not the time for joking.

We're doing serious research
which requires complete and utter focus.

All right. Let's buckle down and work.

 Sheldon.
 What?

 I need an aspirin.
 Top desk drawer.

 Thank you.
 All right?

 Yes.
 Good.

That was fun, ha, ha.

Thank you.

Leonard, you don't have to say
thank you every time we have sex.

Oh, okay.

Tomorrow, you're gonna get a card
in the mail. Just throw it away.

Top of the morning to you.

What are you doing here?

Well, usually on Sundays...

I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks
at the farmer's market...

but he's still working with Sheldon.

So I thought I'd come over here
and make scrambled eggs and salami.

It's the perfect meal for apr�s I'amour.

Kill me.

By the way, I couldn't help overhearing
your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.

See, if you had killed me
when I said "kill me"..

I wouldn't have had to hear that.

What do you guys think?
Wanna take in a matin�e? Go rollerblading?

Catch a step class?

 Do something.
 Yeah. Okay. Um...

Howard, we need to talk.

Sure. What's up, homes?

Please understand that it's not
that we don't want you around.

But Penny and I
occasionally need some alone time.

Oh.

I get it. I'm the third wheel. Heh.

Sorry, I should've seen that.

I'll get out of your way.

Uh, you're gonna wanna eat those eggs
while they're still hot.

Thank you.

And there's lox and cream cheese
in the fridge.

The bagels are in the oven.
I was warming them up.

That's great.

I'm just gonna hang out with my mom.
That's always fun.

Good.

 Are we terrible people?
 I don't know.

What do you want me to do?

Ahh. Get him. Bring him back.

You sure?

Yeah.

Okay. Howard, come back.

Oh, you guys had me scared
for a minute.

No, no. That rate is much too low from
what we'd expect from this collision.

Do you understand we're talking about
dark matter colliding in outer space?

Of course I understand. And who
are you to tell me about outer space?

Well, I'm the astrophysicist.
"Astro" means "space."

"Astro" means "star."

Let me just tell you,
if we were having this argument...

in my native language,
I'd be kicking your butt.

English is your native language.

Okay, you got me there.
But you're wrong about this.

There's a fine line
between wrong and visionary.

Unfortunately,
you have to be a visionary to see it.

God, you think that every thought that
comes out of your head is pure gold.

Let me tell you,
some of those thoughts are pure caca.

Caca?

 It means "doo-doo."
 All right.

First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first
proposed that you work with me...

Aha! So I am working with you?

In this context,
"with me" means "for me."

Oh. Yeah, well, in this context:

All right.

If I'm wrong, prove it.

Okay.

Here's where we derived the mass
of the dark-matter particle.

 You've misstated the weight.
 Let me finish.

 You're defacing my work.
 I'm not. I'm fixing it.

 Give me the eraser.
 No.

I said give it to me.

Come and get it.

Fine.

Oh, Lord.

Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior,
I forbid you from writing on my board.

 You are not my superior.
 I am in every way.

Oh, yeah? Can you do this?

Nice working with you.

I'm sorry. "For you."

Argh!

Raj?

Raj?

I'm busy.

Doing what?

 You've made your point.
 What do you want, Sheldon?

I looked over the board,
and it turns out you were right.

 You were wrong?
 I didn't say that.

 That's the only logical inference.
 I didn't say it.

Anyway, I would like you to come back
and work for me.

For you or with you?

In this context,
"for me" could mean "with me."

 I have conditions.
 I reject them all.

I'll take the job.

See you Monday.

 Wait. You have to drive me home.
 How did you get here?

 I walked.
 So walk home.

I can't. There's a big dog outside.

We can start thinking about methods
of optimizing the detector...

 ...for 500 GeV particles.
 All right.




 What the hell?
 Emergency-preparedness drill.

 Oh, no. Come on.
 Yeah, you know how it works.

Once a quarter, keep our readiness up.

Now, rise and shine, sleepy head.
Half the town is probably dead.

I have to get a lock for my door.

I think you'll like the drill tonight.
I've tried to make it fun.

Each of these cards contains a detailed
scenario of a possible apocalyptic event.

Everything from wildfires
to a surprise invasion by Canada.

Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.

Sheldon, Canada is not
going to invade California.

Yeah, really? You think those hippies
in Washington and Oregon can stop them?

Oh. Fine.

Alrighty. An 8.2-magnitude
earthquake devastates Pasadena...

reducing mighty edifices to dust,
engulfing the city in flames...

the streets flow with blood
and echo with the cries of the wounded.

Oh, excellent choice.
Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.

Oh, fun. I get to spend
another night in front of our apartment...

dressed like one of the Village People.

You make that joke every three months,
I still don't get it. Leonard, wait.

 What are you doing?
 I don't know. What am I doing?

Look around you, there's hypothetical
broken glass everywhere.

Really? You're going to face Armageddon
without your orthotics? Your choice.

 Uh-oh! Hypothetical aftershock.
 Unh! Aah!


And that's why we wear hard hats.

Check it out. Press release. From NASA.

Ahem. "Expedition 31 will launch this spring
to the International Space Station.

Crew members will include
Commander Tom 'Tombo' Johnson...

astronaut Mike 'Supernova' Novacelik,
and payload specialist Howard Wolowitz."


This is going right into
my synagogue's newsletter.

If you're going to be an astronaut,
you need to pick a cool nickname.

I don't get to.
The other guys have to give it to me.

Oh. If I had one,
it would be Brown Dynamite.

Are you not listening to me? The other
astronauts have to give you your nickname.

Are you not looking at me?
I am Brown Dynamite.

Why do you put six sugars
in your coffee?

Because the cafeteria doesn't offer
little packets of methamphetamine.

 Emergency drill night last night, huh?
 Uh-huh.

 How'd you do?
 I'll tell you exactly how he did.

"Readiness: Unsatisfactory.
Follows direction: Barely.


Overall: Not only will he
probably die in a fiery inferno...

his incessant whining would
most certainly spoil everyone else's day."

You know what, I'm so tired
I can't even think straight. I'm going home.

Can one of you
give this nutbag a ride later?

You can't go home.
You have to take me to the dentist at 4:00.

 Oh. Can't you take the bus to the dentist?
 Of course I can.

It's coming back under the effects
of the anesthesia that's the problem.

Two years ago,
after a deep gum cleaning...

I thought I got on a bus but somehow
wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.

 They put you under for a cleaning?
 Yeah, they have to. I'm a biter.

Okay, whatever. Sheldon, I'm exhausted.
I'm not taking you to the dentist.

Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under Section 37B
of the Roommate Agreement...

Miscellaneous Duties,
you are obligated to take me to the dentist.

See? Here, after "providing a confirmation
sniff on questionable dairy products."

You know what?
I am sick of the Roommate Agreement.


It's ridiculous, I'm your roommate,
not your chauffeur.

I had better things to do yesterday...

than drive you to the good
model train store in Garden Grove...

because the one in Pasadena
has gotten too big for its britches.

Well, it has. Ask anybody.

I don't care. I'm done.

Hold on. Are you saying that
you want to invoke Clause 209?

I don't know what that is, but if it means
I can go home and sleep, then yes.

Think carefully here.
Clause 209 suspends our friendship...

and strips the Roommate Agreement
to its essentials.

Our responsibilities toward
each other would be rent...

utilities and a perfunctory chin jut
of recognition as we pass in the hall.

What's up?

Where do I sign?

Right here. Use your finger.

 There. Done.

That's it. We are now
no longer companions, boon or otherwise.

We are now merely acquaintances.

To amend the words of Toy Story,
you have not got a friend in me.

 I'm gonna go home and take a nap.
 Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.

I got pretty exciting NASA news today.

Next week, I fly to Houston for orientation
and zero-gravity elimination drills.

 What does that mean?
 He's gonna learn to poop in space.

Open the pod bay doors, HAL.

Maybe your nickname
should be Brown Dynamite.

Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.

What's up?

My apologies.

I would've been here sooner but the bus
kept stopping for other people to get on it.

I saved you a dumpling.

Oh. Your concern for me is touching.

It will serve you well
when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.

I'm sorry, Sheldon, I'm busy. I'm right
in the middle of my addiction study.

I've got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys,
and tomorrow we switch them to O'Doul's.

You're my girlfriend and
you're not going to cater to my every need?

Oh, where'd the magic go?

Sheldon, that's not
what girlfriends are for.

Although, you don't use them
for what they're for, so what do I know?

Howard doesn't make me
do his shopping, take him to the dentist...

 ...or pick up his dry cleaning, right?
 Absolutely. But when Ma's hips give out...

you're up, kid.

Well, if Amy's too busy, it gives the rest of
you an opportunity to make my life easier...

thus assuring yourselves
a footnote in my memoirs...

tentatively entitled
You're Welcome, Mankind.

All right, then. Just shout when you hear
the task you want to undertake.

Uh, dentist.

Okay, we can circle back
to that one. Um...

Who wants to take me Wednesday morning
to get new heels put on my dress shoes?

Anyone? Oh.

That one had "hoot" written all over it.

Um, all right. Uh, dermatologist.

Allergist.

Podiatrist.

Supercuts?

Okay, okay, here's a fun one.

Um, I need a new picture frame and
I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs.

Who wants to spend the day
with me at Ikea?

 Their meatballs are good.
 What?

Nothing. Nothing.

Hello, Stuart.

Oh, hey, Sheldon.
Can I help you find something today?

No, I was just sitting at home...

thinking about how it might be nice
to catch up with my ninth-favorite person.

 Ninth?
 You moved up one.

My pen pal in Somalia
was kidnapped by pirates.

So, uh, how are you?

Uh, not so good.
My shrink just killed himself...

and blamed me in the note.

Great, great.

So, what's new with your family?
How's your mother? Is she alive?

Yeah.

 Your father. Alive?
 Yes.

 How about your grandparents, they alive?
 No.

Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss.

On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning
appointment this afternoon.

What do you say you take me over there,
buddy boy?

Sorry, you want me to take
you to the dentist?

Yes. And, now,
I can't make any promises...

but that's the sort of thing that gets a fella
on the list for the number eight friend slot.

Sheldon, I'm working.
I can't take you to the dentist.

Also, and I can't stress this enough,
I don't want to take you to the dentist.

Can't help a friend out
in a time of need, huh?

I see where your therapist
was coming from.

Ooh, ooh. What about we make
your astronaut nickname...

Howard "Buzz" Wolowitz?

You can't do Buzz. Buzz is taken.

Buzz Lightyear is not real.

No, that's not what I'm talking about.

Well, are you talking about
when he thought he was real?

No.

Okay, um, oh, how about Crash?
Howard "Crash" Wolowitz.

Terrific. The astronauts would love hurtling
through space with a guy named Crash.

All right, uh, how about...?
Oh, how about Rocket Man?

That's not bad.
Howard "Rocket Man" Wolowitz.

It's great, but I told you,
I don't get to pick my nickname.

It has to come from the other astronauts.

Maybe there's a way
to get them to come up with it.

Like how?

Once I tried carrying around
a Duncan yo-yo...

hoping the other kids
would start calling me Duncan.

 Did it work?
 No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth...

because they took away my yo-yo
and stuffed their socks in my mouth.

Okay. Uh, what if we make
"Rocket Man" your ringtone...

and the next time you talk to those guys,
I'll call you and they'll hear it.

That's not a terrible plan.

They don't call me
Brown Dynamite for nothing.

 What's up?
 What's up?

You ever make it to the dentist?

Not necessary. I found a service that'll send
a van to your house for a teeth cleaning.

Mostly they cater to dogs...

but the fellow on the phone
seemed to have an open mind.

All right, Sheldon, if you need me
to take you to the dentist, I will take you.

Are you suggesting
that you've come to your senses...

and wish to reestablish the benefits
that stem from the Roommate Agreement?

Absolutely. If you admit you're a 30-year-old
man incapable of functioning on his own.

Ooh. Sock Mouth's got him on the ropes.

I will admit nothing of the sort.
And now, if you'll excuse me...

I have to call my dentist and see if I can
get my hair shampooed and nails clipped.




 Oh, good, your power's out too.
 Why is that good?

Last month, I sent the electric company
a Starbucks gift card...

an apology note
and a few snapshots of me in a bra.


Power failure.
Implementing power-failure protocol.

What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark
emergency-exit stuff painted on the floor?

Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic.

Anyway, too bad you're no longer entitled
to the full benefits of my friendship...

because I happen to be
extremely prepared for such an emergency.

Please try not to see anything
by this light.

It's not for you.

It's a blackout,
I'm sure the power will be back on soon.

And I'm sure some fool in the Donner Party
said the snow would stop any day now.

I like to think they ate him first.

I got candles in my apartment.

Candles? During a blackout?
Are you mad? That's a fire hazard.

No, Pasadena Water and Power
recommends the far safer glow stick.

You call that a glow stick?

That is a glow stick.

Come on, let's go.

Before you go, consider this:

Not only do I have a deep-cycle
marine battery power source...

more than capable of running
our entertainment system...

I also have all 61 episodes
of the BBC series Red Dwarf.

And Fiddle Faddle.

All yours if you're willing to reinstate
the Roommate Agreement.

I've got wine at my place
and some bubble wrap we could pop.

He'll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark,
he's gonna be bored out of his mind.

To wine and bubble wrap.


And to not having to watch Sheldon
demonstrate his reverse-osmosis machine...

that converts urine into drinking water.

You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dineesha
said you could do that with panty hose.

Boy, was she wrong.

Anyway, you wanna make out?

I thought because our relationship's in
a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.

Okay. Do you wanna make out slow?

I can go so slow it'll be like
there's a snail in your mouth.

Oh...

Lucky for you
there's nothing else to do right now.

 Excuse me, Leonard.
 Since when don't you knock?

It's, like, the only good thing about you.

Social niceties have been suspended.
We're in a state of emergency.

The world has descended
into darkened turmoil...

lawlessness and savagery
are the order of the day.

 Fine, what is it?
 I'm making s'mores.

I wanted to alert you in case you smelled
caramelizing marshmallows...

and thought
a nearby candy factory was on fire.

 S'mores, huh? Good for you.
 Yes.

Or good for us if you sign here and
reinstate the full Roommate Agreement.

No, thanks, I'm good.

Really? Oh.

Okay. In that case,
I will have a s'more by myself.

And then I'm gonna have some more.

By myself.

 Aw.
 Now, don't "aw" him...

he brought all this on himself.

 But he's sad.
 No, he's crazy.

Sometimes crazy looks like sad
so it'll suck you back in.

I think he misses his little buddy.

Fine.

But mark my words, this frustrating bogus
teenage make out session is not over.


You said candles were dangerous.

This is a Bunsen burner.

I'm a scientist. I know what I'm doing.

Oh, drat.

Oh. It took me a gallon of urine
to make that water.

Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid.
I don't see why we can't be friends.

I'm willing to drive you
and help you out with stuff...

I just don't want to
because of some agreement.

 What are you proposing?
 That we go back to the way things were.

But when I do something for you,
you show a little appreciation.

How would I do that?

 You say "thank you."
 Every time?

It's not crazy.

Counter-proposal.

We reinstate the full Roommate Agreement
with the following addendum:

In the spirit of Mother's Day
or Father's Day, once a year...

we set aside a day to celebrate
all your contributions to my life...

both actual and imagined by you.

We could call it Leonard's Day.

I kind of like the sound of that.

Of course you do.
It's about you, like everything else.

Oh, thank goodness. I don't think I had it
in me to make another glass of water.

So do I get breakfast in bed
on Leonard's Day?

 No.
 Can I sit in your spot?

 No.
 Could I control the thermostat?

 No.
 Do I get a card?

Of course you get a card.

It's Leonard's Day.

Hey, guys. The building manager said
the reason the power went out...

is someone went into the basement
and pulled the main breaker switch.

Really.

Who do you think did that, Sheldon?

Oh, I don't know.

But whoever that mystery man was,
you should be eternally grateful...

for without him,
there would be no Leonard's Day.

Leonard's Day?

No pressure,
just get him a crummy card, you're good.

All right, test my ringtone.

Rocket man

Burning out his fuse up here alone

 It really is a good song.
 Yeah, there's a reason he's Sir Elton John.

They don't make you a knight for writing
"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go."

are you coming down for breakfast?

Ma, I told you, I have a video conference
with NASA! I said don't bother me!

Ooh, listen to Mr. Big-Shot-Astronaut!

Yes, please listen
to Mr. Big-Shot-Astronaut!


Hey. Good morning.

Hey, Howard.
Thanks for getting up so early.

No problem, Dr. Massimino.

The guys here call me Mass.

Mass. That's a cool nickname, because
force equals mass times acceleration.

Yeah. It's just short for Massimino.

Anyway, the plan for this morning
is to go over the...


Sorry. My phone.

What is that? Is that "Rocket Man"?

Yeah, it's my ringtone.
Kind of my favorite song, "Rocket Man."

your Froot Loops are getting soggy!


 Who's that?
 My mom. Sorry.

No problem, Fruit Loops.



Why hast thou forsaken me, O
deity whose existence I doubt?

Here. Breathe
into this bag.

What's going on?

They stole everything, Leonard!

Everything.

Are you the roommate?

Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter.
What happened?

Your friend here called 911
to report a robbery.

Oh, my God,
what did they get?

What didn't they get?

They got my enchanted weapons,

my vicious gladiator armor,

my wand of untainted power,

and all my gold!

You called the police

because someone hacked your
World of Warcraft account?

What choice did I have?

The mighty Sheldor,
level 85 blood elf,

hero of the Eastern kingdoms,

has been picked clean, like
a carcass in the desert sun.

Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

Into the bag.

They took my battle ostrich!

 Oh, no, not Glenn!
 Yes!

Glenn!

The only bird I ever loved.

Good luck, fellas.

Oh. Well, thank you, officer.

Wait a minute!

You're not going to do anything?

Mr. Cooper,
there's nothing...

Dr. Cooper.

Seriously?

Not the kind with
access to drugs.

Fine. Dr. Cooper.

I'm sorry for your loss,

but the Pasadena
Police Department

doesn't have
jurisdiction in...

Pandora.

That's from Avatar!

World of Warcraft
takes place in Azeroth.

Goodness gracious, how are you
allowed to carry a gun?

Can you at least refer me
to a rogue ex-cop?

What?

Wh-- you know, one who was
drummed off the force

because he refused
to play by the rules,

and now he hires himself out

to impose his own brand
of rough justice?

No.

Thank you, officer.

It's all gone. All gone.

I'm really
sorry, Sheldon.

What kind of world
do we live in,

where a man would take
another man's battle ostrich?

I don't know.

This act of aggression
must be met

with swift and cruel ferocity.

It is time to cry havoc,
and let slip the dogs of war.

I'm on it.

Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz.
Is, is Howard there?

Okay, thanks.

That particular dog of war

will have to call you back
after his bath.

See if Raj is done with Pilates.

 


Three thousand hours.

Three thousand hours
clicking on that mouse,

collecting weapons and gold.

It's almost as if it was
a huge waste of time.

Whoever did this
knew what they were doing.

He got in and out
of your account in under

15 minutes, transferred
all your stuff,

and didn't leave
a digital fingerprint.

Oh!

There isn't enough
chamomile tea in the world

to quell the rage in my heart.

Hold on. I'm talking to an orc

under the bridge
in Thunder Bluff

who says if we pay him, he'll
help us track down your things.

Can we trust him?

I should say so;
he appears to be a member

of the Nigerian royal family.

Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off
a jeweled ostrich bridle!

No. Glenn's was leather.

He was a simple ostrich.

Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.

Hey.

Hey, Penny. We're kind of in
the middle of a crisis, here.

Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

Sorry, Sheldon. I know
that game meant a lot to you.

What-- "that game"?

Excuse me, Penny, but
Doodle Jump is a game.

Angry Birds is a game.

World of Warcraft is a

massively multi-player
online role-playing...

all right,
technically it's a game.

Bad news, the Nigerian prince
may be a fraud.

Okay, well, anyways,
I brought you

a day-old cheesecake
to cheer you up!

Stale pastry
is hollow succor

to a man who is
bereft of ostrich.

Just say "thank you."

I thought I just did.

All right. See you later.

Oh! Hello.

Oh, hi! I was just
dropping off a cheesecake

to Sheldon. He was robbed
of a bunch of imaginary crap

that's useful in
a make-believe place.

I don't know what that means.

Yeah, well,
sadly, I do.

Did you know last weekend
Priya took Leonard

rollerblading
at the beach?

Can you believe that?

I feel like I'm supposed
to say "that bitch,"

but I don't have
enough information.

I am the one who
spent two years

trying to get him to even

go to the beach
in the first place.

And he was so phobic about
stepping on medical waste,

I had to carry him
to the water.

I took Howard to the beach once.

He almost burst into flames
like a vampire.

So what's the thanks
I get for turning Leonard

into quality boyfriend material?

I have to tiptoe around
his new girlfriend.

I think you're on.
Oh.

That bitch!

Want some coffee liqueur
on your ice cream?

Ah, here's the alcohol
and drug peer pressure

Mother warned me about.

I was starting to think
it was never going to happen.

Yes, please.

You guys should've seen Leonard
when I first met him.

There was no eye contact.

He was either looking
up at the ceiling,

or down at his shoes.

I'm drunk.

You know, for the
first couple of months,

whenever I would
take off my bra,

he would giggle and say,
"Oh, boy, my breast friends!"

Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

I'm never speaking
to Priya again.

No, don't do that.

No reason to be mean to her.

This may be the
alcohol talking...

but I believe there is.

Are you familiar
with the recent study

of Tanzanian chimpanzees
by Nishida and Hosaka

out of Kyoto University?

No, but I can name
all the Kardashians.

Primates, such as ourselves,
have a natural instinct

to ostracize ill-mannered
members of the troop.

Bernadette's urge to

shun, scowl or
fling her waste at Priya

is hard-wired into her DNA.

I don't have an urge
to fling my waste.

Believe me, it's there,
we all have it.

Hit me with some more booze,
and I'll show you.

All right, here we are--
this is the tavern

where all the black-market
weapon trades go down.

I don't think my character
should be in a place like this.

Everyone's undressing
her with their eyes.

Maybe if you stop
dropping your sword

and bending over to pick it up.

Okay, what exactly
are we looking for?

Redheaded troll,
goes by the name of Glumly.

According to the
message boards,

if you want to
move stolen goods

and it's after school
hours, he's your guy.

Leonard,
is this going

to take much longer?
I thought we were

going to spend
some time together.

Uh, we are.
In the meantime,

you're welcome to whip up
a quick character and join us.

Seriously?

Well, you have to put
in a credit card number,

but it's fun.

Maybe I should just go home.

Our troll just walked
in! I got him!

We got him.
We're almost done.

So, how do

you guys want
to play this?

Be ruthless.
You tell him

if he doesn't start talking,
we'll register a complaint

with his Internet
service provider.

Sheldon, what if he gets his
Internet from his cable company?

He could lose his HBO and all their
delightful original programming.

I don't care!
I'm losin' it, man!

Why don't we play this smart?

Try a little
"good goblin, bad goblin."

Oh, dear Lord.

Nah, I think we have
to be more subtle.

Okay, I see where
this is going.

Fine, I'll have
sex with him.

That's not where it was going.

Good, because
I would hate that.

Leonard, you're busy--
let's talk tomorrow.

Oh, wait.

 Hang on. Are you upset?
 No, no, I think

it's sexy to date a boy
trapped in a man's body.

Oh.

Good, good.

I'll tell you
what happens.

And people think I
don't get sarcasm.

Well, well, well.

Look who it is.

Okay, be nice.

Hello.

Hi. We're just
heading out for a drink.

Because I do that now.

Count your blessings

you're not a Tanzanian chimp.

What?

Don't listen to her--

she's had a lot
of ice cream.

Do you want to join us?

Oh, thank you,
but I have work to do.

Four women walk
down the stairs--

how many reach the lobby?

Did your sister say anything
when you got home last night?

Oh, no, don't put me
in the middle of this.

I'm not going to
be your go-between.

Come on, help me out.

Am I in trouble?

There's no
reason to worry.

That's a relief.

I'm sure
many women

in happy relationships
spend their nights

Skyping with their
ex-boyfriend Sanjay.

Good news, gentlemen--
I found our hacker.

 What?
 Really?

Yeah. No one can hide from me,

not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego,

not even topless
Natalie Portman.

I've never said
these words before,

but good job, Howard!

Thanks. Our culprit
is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711

Ocean View Road,

Carlsbad, California.

The name and the address
drip with evil.

What else do we know about him?

Why, quite a
bit, actually.

I'll bet he's some loser
who lives with his parents.

Yes, he does live
with his parents.

Here's a Google Earth
shot of their house.

Excellent!
It's in a cul-de-sac.

We can box him in.

Hold on, you're thinking
of going there?

Carlsbad is only
a couple of hours away.

Fine.

You walk up to the house,
knock on the door

and demand your stuff back.
What if he says no?

I don't know if you've been
following the news, Leonard,

but there have been
some terrific advancements

in the field of torture.

No one's getting tortured.

Fine, we'll abide by
the Geneva Convention.

But ask yourself this:

in the course
of our lives,

how much lunch money
has been taken from us?

How many kites?

How many Scooby-Doo
Trapper Keepers?

I totally had one of those.

Of course you did.

It was a fun and practical way
of organizing your school work.

But the bullies
took it from us.

Well, no more.

Tonight, we take back
our dignity,

our birthright and our pride.

What do you say?

Who's with me?

I have a hip-hop aerobics class
at 5:00; could we go after?

Sure.

Also, tonight's the Sabbath

and my mother and I
have a tradition of

lighting the candles and
watching Wheel of Fortune, so...

If we could leave

at 8:00, we'd still be able to

regain our birthright
at 10:00, 10:30 latest.

Fine.

Leonard?

Oh, geez, I-I don't know
if I can ditch Priya

two nights in a row.

Oh, come on, man.

Bros before...

my sister.

Aw, screw it.

I'm in.
Me, too.

And me.

One moment.

I'm hell-bent on catching
a cyber criminal,

not the common cold.

I'm sorry, I thought
this delay was

so you could watch Wheel of
Fortune with your mother.

I am.

She's just bleaching
her mustache.

Check it out.

Hey, Ma!
"Before and After!"

Four words, 17 letters,
two N's, one V!

"Fanny pack of wolves!"

That's incredible.

Yeah, she's kind of
a Wheel savant.

Uh-oh, that's Priya.

Sitar music for her ringtone
is not cool, dude.

Hit the...

Hey, sweetie.

Yeah, I'm sorry.

I'm gonna be working late.

Yeah, I-I miss you, too.

Okay, sure, I'll call you
when I get home.

Okay, bye-bye.

Very nice.

You lie to my sister.

That's the nicest thing
he does to your sister.

Oh, guess who.

Cover for me.

Hello, Priya. What's up?

How would I know
if Leonard's at work or not?

Don't be suspicious.

Look, if you want your
relationship with Leonard

to continue,
you're going to have to believe

whatever wild-eyed,
cockamamie excuse

the white devil
has the nerve to offer you.

Okay? Yeah, bye-bye.

You owe me.

New puzzle, Ma!

"Same name"!

One N, two D's, three O's!

Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!

That's uncanny.

I know.
It's her superpower.

Well, that and jiggling
her arm fat.

I can't believe we're going
all the way to San Diego

to confront this guy.

Yeah, we're kind of
bad-asses, aren't we?

Totally.

Hey, how about
we stay the night

and hit Legoland
in the morning?

Sea World is better.

It has Shamu, who is
literally tons of fun.

But for the moment, let's stay
focused on Todd Zarnecki.

Yeah, we're coming for you,
Todd Zarnecki.

And for the record, Legoland
is more interactive.

I almost feel sorry

for the poor fool, sitting in
his split-level suburban ranch,

unaware that

a vengeful horde is barreling
down the San Diego Freeway

at 71 miles an hour.

Ease up there, lead foot.

You trying to get us killed?

I took the liberty
of burning us

a mix of heroic
questing music.

This says "Beyonce
Bootylicious Dance Mix."

It's a
re-writable CD.

Just put it in.

Beyonce? Really?

She's curvy and she owns it.

I like that.

Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.

We are winged fury!

Which is still no excuse

for going over
the posted speed limit.

 

Next time we go to
kick someone's ass,

we take the train.

I always prefer the train.

Sheldon, let's go.

Coming.

Why did you bring that?

No weapon strikes more fear
into a man's heart

than a Klingon bat'leth.

Okay, let's get
clear on something.

We're just going to tell
this guy to transfer all of

your stuff back into your
account and then be on our way.

No one's bat'lething anybody.

So my blade shall not
taste blood tonight?

No.

Well, now I just feel silly
holding it.

Come on.

Can I at least
kick down the door?

You're welcome to try, but
the other day, it took you

15 minutes to get
into a FedEx box.

Who is it?

Your doom!

Don't say "your doom."

Who opens the door
for their doom?

Good point.

Basket of puppies.

What?

Uh...

Sheldon?

Are you Todd Zarnecki?

Yeah. Who are you?

I am Sheldor of Azeroth.

I want my things back.

I don't think so.

Let me see that.

Careful.
That's a collectible.

I know.

I've always wanted one.

Well, he's even more cunning
than we thought.

You know, the joke's on him.

Without the certificate of
authenticity,

that bat'leth is worthless.

Yeah, he walked
right into our trap.

Legoland seems like
a hollow dream now.

Uh-oh.

What's the matter?
Something's wrong.

I'm not getting any gas.

Anybody know anything about
internal combustion engines?

Of course.

19th-century technology.
Very basic.

Does anybody know how to fix
an internal combustion engine?

No. No.
Not a clue.

Well, we'd better call somebody
to come pick us up.

It'd be swell
if they had a train.

Thank you, Penny.

No problem.

So, Leonard,

I think it's interesting
you didn't call your girlfriend

to come get you.

Uh, I kind of
told her I was working.

So you lied to her.

Also interesting.

Yeah, she doesn't really
understand

the whole Warcraft
adventure-role-playing thing.

Well, doesn't matter if she gets
it, as long as she's pretty.

This one's funny,
Leonard.

How come you couldn't
make it work with her?

So did you at least get
Sheldon's fake stuff back?

No. We failed
in our noble quest.

How come?

Todd Zarnecki was mean.

All right. Hang on.

What are you doing?

I'm gonna show you how we
finish a quest in Nebraska.

Oh. Beyonce.

This ain't no Beyonce.

Now what?

Give my friend his stuff back.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

Well, then, good news.

Today's the day a girl's
finally going to touch you

in your little special place.

Now give him his stuff back.

Okay.

We did it!

I said, "we."

Oh, hold the door.

 Oh, hi.
 Hi.

Going to see Leonard?

Yes.

How have you been?

Fine. You?

Very well, thank you.


All right, well,
great seeing you.

Yeah. You, too.

Amy's right.

I do want
to fling my poop at her.


Good morning.

We're gonna have to stop
by Pottery Barn on the way to work.

I bought these Star Wars sheets, but,

they turned out to be
much too stimulating

to be compatible
with a good night's sleep.

I don't like the way
Darth Vader stares at me.

I'm not going to work.

Just because your career's
been stagnant for a few years,

that's no reason to give up.

I was up all night
using the new free-electron laser

for my X-ray
diffraction experiment.

Did the laser accidentally
burn out your retinas?

No.

Then you can drive. Let's go.

Ddn't I tell you
I'd be working nights and that

you'd have to make
other arrangements?

 You did.
 And?

I didn't.

Let's go.

Good night.

 But how am I going to get to work?
 Take the bus.

I can't take the bus anymore.
They don't have seat belts,

and they won't let you latch yourself
to the seat with bungee cords.

You tried to latch yourself
to the seat with bungee cords?

I didn't try. I succeeded.

But for some reason,
it alarmed the other passengers

and I was asked to de-bus.

You're a big boy.
You'll figure it out.

Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

Now, take me to return
my Star Wars sheets!

What is it?

Leonard's asleep.

Thanks for the update.

No. Wait.

You have to drive me to work.

Yeah, I really don't think I do.

But I don't drive,
and I can't take the bus.

You'll be fine as long as you don't do
that bungee cord thing, okay?

Didn't you recently state
that you and I are friends?

Yes, Sheldon. We are friends.

Then I hereby invoke
what I'm given to understand

is an integral part
of the implied covenant of friendship.

The favor.

Oh, dear God.

I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was interrupting your morning prayers.

When you're done, we'll go.

Subtitles: sub-way.fr

Thank you for driving me to work.

You know this is my day off?

Oh, good.
I'm not keeping you from anything.

Your "check engine" light is on.

Typically that's an indicator
to, you know, check your engine.

It's fine.
It's been on for, like, a month.

Actually, that would be
all the more reason to...

you know, check your engine.

Sheldon, it's fine.

If it were fine,
the light wouldn't be on.

That's why the manufacturer installed
that light, to let you know it's not fine.

Maybe the light's broken.

Is there a "check the 'check
engine light' light"?

What?

Studies have shown
that performing tasks

such as eating, talking on a cell phone
or drinking coffee while driving

reduces one's reaction time

by the same factor
as an ounce of alcohol.

Do you have any alcohol?

 Of course not.
 Too bad.

You're going up Euclid Avenue?

Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.

Good for Leonard.

Euclid Avenue is shorter
as the crow flies,

but it has speed bumps,
which appreciably increase

point-to-point drive time,
making it the less efficient choice.

But you have the conn.

If you're not going
to slow down for the speed bumps,

I withdraw my previous objection.

Here's a fun question.

Do you know what the most
common street name is?

 No.
 The answer's tricky.

It's Second Street.

You'd think it would be First Street,
but in most towns,

First Street eventually
gets renamed to something else.

You know,
like Main Street,

Broad Street.

Michigan Avenue.

Leonard and I
often use our commute time

to exercise our minds
with brain-teasers like that.

We also play games.

 Would you like to play one?
 No.

Come on. It's fun.

Another bump.

Okay. I'll say an element,
and you say an element

whose name starts with the last letter
of the one I said, okay?

I'll start.

Helium.

Now, you could say "mercury."

That would give me a "y."
Very clever. That's a tough one.

So I go with "ytterbium,"
which gets you back to "m."

So you go "molybdenum,"
and I say "magnesium."

You say "manganese."
I say "europium,"

and, then, you're left
with "mendelevium,"

and... there are no more m's

because I believe that meitnerium
should still be called ekairidium.

So, congratulations. You win.

Do you wanna go again?

Why don't we just have
a little quiet time now?

All right.

I'm sorry.
I'm finding your reckless nonchalance

regarding the check-engine light
to be very troubling.

Get out.

I have to tell you that while I do have
a theoretical understanding

of the workings
of an internal combustion engine,

I'm not sure I'm capable
of performing diagnostics.

I said, "Get out."

Okay. I'll give it a shot.

There you are.
I'm ready to go home.

 I just got here.
 Good. Perfect timing.

I told you, I only have access
to the free-electron laser at night.

I can't drive you
for the next few weeks.

No, you said you couldn't
drive me to work.

This is from work.

Howard, help me out here.

No, just for the fun of it,
I'm gonna take his side.

Now,
how do you propose I get home?

How did you get here
in the first place?

Penny.

But I sense
that's no longer an option.

I need to get to the laser lab.

You're just gonna have
to find someone else to take you home.

Damn, I picked the wrong side.

God, not Euclid Avenue!

Why did Howard leave you
in the middle of the road anyway?

 We had a difference of opinion.
 Over what?

Whether or not
he was trying to kill me.

For the record,
I maintain he was.

Where are you going?
I'm taking you home.

But I'm not going home.
It's Wednesday.

Wednesday's new comic book day.
We have to go to the comic book store.

Then, we have to stop
at Souplantation;

it's creamy tomato soup day.

And Radio Shack.
There's a sale on triple-A batteries.

Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn
and return my Star Wars sheets.

I have a better idea.

You want to go
to Pottery Barn first?

Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?

Maybe if I turn off the night-light,
I can keep the sheets.

Good morning.

Good morning.

Sheldon, sit down.

She's in my spot.

Don't look at me like that.
Everybody knows that's my spot.

You know that we care about you.

And it's because we care about you
that we've decided we have to speak up.

You're hurting the people
around you, sweetie.

So we made you an appointment,
and we want you to keep it.

Department of Motor Vehicles
New Driver Handbook?

But I don't have a problem.

Sheldon, you need
to learn how to drive.

This madness has to stop.

Penny's taking you to the DMV.
I'm going to bed.

 Why Penny?
 Because rock breaks scissors.

Good night.

 All right, come on, Sheldon.
 Hold on.

 I have one condition.
 What?

We have to stop at Pottery Barn.

And Radio Shack.

Fine.

 And the comic book store.
 All right!

I want to go
to the comic book store.

I like comic books.

I still don't see
why I need a driver's license.

Albert Einstein never had
a driver's license.

Yeah, but Albert Einstein
didn't make me wet myself

at 40 miles an hour.

Yeah, and I never wanted to kick
Albert Einstein in the nuts.

I gotta ask, why didn't you just get
a license at 16 like everybody else?

I was otherwise engaged.

Doing what?

Examing perturbative amplitudes
in N=4 supersymmetric theories

leading to a re-examination
of the ultraviolet properties

of multi-loop N=8 supergravity
using modern twistor theory.

Well, how about
when you were 17?

Take this to the testing area,
put your name at the top,

sign the bottom, answer the questions,
bring it back. Next.

Application?

I'm actually more of a theorist.

The application in your hand.

Give it to her.

Take this to the testing area,
put your name at the top,

sign the bottom, answer the questions,
bring it back. Next!

Excuse me, but I have some
concerns about these questions.

Look at that sign up there.

Does it say "I give a damn"?

That's because I don't.

Just look.
This first question makes no sense.

"How many car lengths should you leave
in front of you when driving?"

There's no possible way
to answer that.

A "car length" is not
a standardized unit of measure.

Look at the sign.

 It's "C." Just put down "C."
 I don't need your help, Penny.

Listen to that little girl, honey.
Put "C." Next!

Wait! Hang on.

 Look at this next question.
 Why are you arguing with the DMV?

How else are they going to learn?

Look... question two:

"When are roadways most slippery?"

Now, there are 3 answers,
none of which are correct.

The correct answer is
"when covered by a film of liquid

"sufficient to reduce
the coefficient of static friction

"between the tire and the road
to essentially zero,

"but not so deep as to introduce
a new source of friction."

Here's your learner's permit.
Go away.

But I'm not done.

I have many additional concerns
about these questions.

 Don't make me climb over this counter.
 Come on.

Next!

Aced it.

That's... it.
Let's boot it up.

Booting.

This is a state-of-the-art simulator.

I adapted it from something
a friend of mine designed for the army.

Is that why I appear to be
in downtown Fallujah

behind the wheel
of an up-armored Humvee?

I haven't configured it yet.

Let's see...

Bradley tank...

transport truck...
Batmobile...

Here we go.
Red 2006 Ford Taurus

on the streets of Pasadena.

What?

Statistically, red cars
are stopped by police

far more often
than any other color.

I don't want any hassles
with the fuzz.

Fine, what color do you want?

You know the pale blue
of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber?

Before it was digitally remastered?

Black, it is.

Okay, now, what you want to do first
is turn on the ignition

and shift into drive.

I haven't fastened
my seat belt yet.

Okay, fasten your seat belt.

 Now, are there air bags?
 You don't need air bags.

What if a simulated van
rear-ends me?

I'll hit you in the face
with a pillow.

Okay, now shift into drive.

Pull out slowly into traffic.

Watch out, watch, watch out
for the pedestrians!

Wait-- slow--
Hit the brakes! The brakes!

Thank you.

Sorry. Excuse me.

My bad.

Student driver.

How did you manage to get
on the 2d floor

of the Glendale Galleria?

I don't know.

I was on the Pasadena freeway.
I missed my exit,

flew off the overpass,
and one thing led to another.

Maybe you want to give it a rest
and try again tomorrow.

I quit.

The pet store...

Remind me to compliment Wolowitz
on the software.

It's amazingly detailed.

So wait, you're just
gonna give up?

No, I'm not giving up.

I never give up.

So, what is it you're doing?

I'm...

transcending the situation.

I'm clearly

too evolved for driving.

What does that mean?

Have you ever wondered
why my little toes and lateral incisors

are significantly smaller
than the average for someone of my size?

I wonder a lot of things about you.
But not-not that.

Well, those are indicators

that I'm farther along
the evolutionary scale

 than the average human.
 No kidding.

Hold on.

I'm not gonna go so far as to say

that I represent a distinct
new stage in humankind--

you know, a homo novus,
if you will.

That's for anthropologists to decide.

But I am convinced

that the reason I cannot master
the plebeian task of driving

is because I'm not meant to.

Yes, you are.
You're meant to learn how to drive.

Please learn how to drive!

I'm meant for greater things,

like unraveling the mysteries
of the universe,

not determing when it's safe

to pass a stopped school bus
on a country road.

 It's never safe.
 Yeah, well, I know that now.

Fine.

Assuming that everything
you say is true,

how does the biologically superior
homo novus get to work tomorrow morning?

Homo novus doesn't know.

Well, hang in there.

Maybe you'll evolve
into something with wings.

Good morning, gentlemen.

Good morning.

Is there some new kind of casual Friday
I don't know about?

No, he lives here now.

Really? Why?

Since he won't take the bus
and he's too evolved to drive,

he decided it would be easier
to sleep in his office

and shower in the radiation lab

until I'm finished
with my experiment.

But you finished your experiment
a week ago.

You saw nothing!



Okay, Baby-Doll Pink...

let's see if you can cover up the fact
that I got my dad's feet.

It's two degrees, Sheldon.

I just wanna turn up
the thermostat two degrees.

Let me point out
that two degrees can be the difference...

between water and steam.

Yes, if we were lived in a tea kettle.

This is the temperature you
agreed to in the roommate agreement.

Screw the roommate agreement.

No, you don't screw
the roommate agreement...

the roommate agreement screws you.

You know what,
go to hell and set their thermostat.

I don't have to go to hell.
At 73 degrees, I'm there already.

Who is it?

 Leonard.
 Hang on.

Can I sleep on your couch tonight?

You can try, but the people
across the hall are being very noisy.

You heard that, huh?

Apparently, the one fella
tried to adjust the thermostat...

then the other fella
went bat-crap crazy.

So you agree he's nuts.

Not as nuts as the guy
who chooses to live with him.

Believe it or not,
he was worse when I met him.

Oh, I do not believe that.

You are so naive.

Just like I was seven years ago.

I'd just started at the university.

Excuse me, I'm looking
for Sheldon Cooper's apartment.

 Oh. I bet you're here to check out the room.
 Yeah.

Run away, dude.

 What?
 Run fast, run far.

That should've been my first clue.

So Sheldon's last roommate
tried to warn you off?

For all I knew, he was the crazy one.

He had this really deranged look.

Well, yeah, he'd been living with Sheldon.

Sure, it makes sense now.

Anyway, I went upstairs
and knocked on the door.

Yeah?

Dr. Cooper?

No, you want the crazy guy
across the hall.

In retrospect, that was clue number two.

 Yes?
 I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

 I called about the apartment. You said...
 I know what I said. I know what you said.

I know what my mother said
on March 5th, 1992.

What is the sixth noble gas?

 What?
 You said you're a scientist.

 What is the sixth noble gas?
 Uh, Radon?

Are you asking me or telling me?

Telling you?

Telling you.

All right. Next question.

Kirk or Picard?

Oh, uh... Well, that's tricky. Um...

Well, original series over
Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.

Correct.

You've passed the first barrier
to roommate hood.

You may enter.

Oh, this is pretty nice.

 The bedrooms are back there?
 That depends.

I don't understand.
Their existence is conditional?

No. But your ability to
perceive their existence is conditional...

on you passing
the second and third barriers.

 There's three?
 Each more daunting than the last.

 Have a seat.
 Okay.

No, that's where I sit.

What's the difference?

This seat is ideally located...

in relation to the heat source in the
winter and a cross breeze in the summer.

It also faces the television
at a direct angle...

allowing me to immerse myself
in entertainment or game play...

without being subjected to conversation.
As a result...

I've placed it in a state of eternal dibs.

Can you do that?

That's Latin for "My chair my rules."

Now, you said on the phone
that your area of study is physics.

Yeah, experimental physics.

Hmm.

 What is that?
 Doesn't concern you.

You'll be going to the university
every day?

 Yes.
 Do you have a vehicle?

 A car.
 And you'd be willing to drive me?

 Well, can't you drive?
 I can.

I choose not to.

Okay, I suppose I could drive you.

 Well, what's a point in my favor, right?
 Why don't you let me do this?

Come on, I just asked.

Last question.
In a post-apocalyptic world...

which task would you assign
the highest priority?

Locating a sustainable food source,
reestablishing a functioning government...

procreation
or preserving the knowledge of mankind?

Uh, I'm gonna go with
preserving the knowledge.

That's correct.

FYI, I would've accepted
any answer other than procreating.

Come, I'll show you
the rest of the apartment.

Good. I passed the barriers.

The second barrier. Don't get cocky.

This is the bathroom.

Are you fairly regular?

 Uh... I guess.
 This isn't going to work if you're guessing.

When do you evacuate your bowels?

When I have to.

When you have to?
I'm sorry, I don't rent to hippies.

I'm sorry, in the morning. Around 8.

I can't give you 8. I can give you 7:30.

Fine, I'll take it.

Third barrier passed.

You have won the right to see your room.

Pizah.

 Is this it?
 No, this is my room.

People don't go in my room.

So where do you sleep? Heh.

I don't understand.

If people don't go in there,
and you're people and...

You are people, aren't you?

Making a joke.

Do you do this often?

On occasion.

Your room.

You may wanna repaint.

And after all that you just moved in?

I didn't just move in.
First we had to iron out a few details.

"Roommates agree
that Friday nights shall be reserved...

for watching Joss Whedon's
brilliant new series, Firefly."

Does that really need to be
in the agreement?

Might as well settle it now,
it's gonna be on for years.

Initial here.

All right, that's television and movies.

"Section nine: Miscellany.

The apartment's flag is a gold lion
rampant on a field of azure."

We have a flag?

Never fly it upside down.

Unless the apartment's in distress.

Fine, next.

"If either of us ever invents time travel...

we agree our first stop will be this
meeting today in precisely five seconds."

Okay.

Well, that's disappointing.

Why on earth did you agree to all that?

It was the best apartment I'd seen,
the rent was very reasonable...

and after you pass the first three barriers,
you kind of wanna take it all the way.

Well, I'm sorry, Leonard.
It's very hard to feel sympathy for you.

Okay. Let me tell you about the first time
I brought a girl over.

Leonard?

Shh. Just pretend we're not here.

Leonard?

I'm sure he'll go away.

I'm just gonna keep knocking
till you answer.

Leonard?

Leonard? Leonard?

What do you want?

I didn't say come in.

You asked what I want.

I wanted to come in.

I'm here because you violated
our roommate agreement.

Specifically, section eight...

visitor's subsection C, females,
paragraph four, coitus.

"Roommates shall give each other
12 hours notice of impending coitus."

I didn't even know her 12 hours ago.

That's it, I'm out of here.

Joyce, come on.

Twelve hours?

Oh, my God.

 Do I get some sympathy now?
 Little bit.

Let me get this straight.

You move in with this guy, makes
you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement.

Then he walks into your bedroom
while you're doing Joyce Kim...

and you still stay?

Actually, I couldn't get too mad at him
about Joyce Kim.

Why not?

Well, I was doing some
government research at the time.

You know, military rocket fuels.
Kind of secret.

 What does that have to do with Joyce?
 As it turns out...

she was a North Korean spy.

Luckily, Sheldon drove her out
before I revealed anything important.

Which I'm not saying I would have.

So you stayed with Sheldon
all this time...

because he kept you from going
to federal prison?

That's part of it. The other part is
what happened with the elevator.

I've been wondering. You said
it was working when you moved in.

It was. But one night
Sheldon came home from work...

What is going on here?

Hey, this is Howard and Raj.
They work at the university too.

 Hey.
 Hey.

I'll get to you later.

What are you sitting on?

I can't speak for these guys,
but I'm sitting on my tushy. Heh, heh.

 It's a joke.
 Not a good idea.

 "Tushy" is "buttocks," right?
 Right.

Heh. Hilarious. Heh, heh.

Explain the couch.

There were people on the first floor
who were moving out and sold it for $100.

 Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.
 What's wrong with the furniture we have?

They are lawn chairs.

There was no place for company.

Did it occur to you that was by design?

According to the roommate agreement,
I'm entitled to allocate 50 percent...

of the cubic footage
of common areas.

But you didn't notify me by e-mail,
so this is still a breach.

I did notify you.

Oh, you did, did you?

Drat.

Hoisted by my own spam filter.

 What am I doing in your spam?
 I put you there after you forwarded me...

a picture of a cat playing
the piano entitled "T his is funny."

Oh, yeah. I saw that. That was hilarious.
Heh-heh-heh.

 What's this have to do with the elevator?
 I'm getting to it.

I assure you, you'll be sorry
you wasted your money on an iPod...

when Microsoft comes out with theirs.

Okay, do you have an opinion
about everything?

Yes.

You just assume you're always right?

It's not an assumption.

 Change seats with me.
 Why?

I don't like this spot.
I have to keep turning my head.

Fine.

It's time for Babylon 5.

We don't watch Babylon 5
in this apartment.

 Why not?
 Because no one likes Babylon 5.

 I like it.
 Me too.

 So do I.
 There you go, three against one.

They don't get a vote. It's one against one.

And according to the roommate agreement,
all ties will be settled by me.

 But I said no to that.
 And I said yes.

And I settle all ties.

 Change seats with me.
 Why?

There's a draft on my neck over here.

So I get the draft?

You're protected by your turtleneck.

Fine.

And it's a dickey.

Hmm...

I'm still not comfortable.

Of course,
there's too many people here.

We can fix that. Let's leave.

Yeah, we can go over to my place.

Wait, let me get my jacket.

 You're not going with us.
 Why not?

You're the guy
we're trying to get away from.

Oh.

In that case, I don't need my jacket.

And for the record,
the correct syntax is:

"I'm the guy from whom
you're trying to get away."

Oh, yes.

This is definitely gonna be my spot.

Okay. How do you know he said that?
You left the room.

Hey, do you want me to finish
working on your man-feet or not?

Fine. Go ahead.

Howard, are you having a playdate?!

I don't have playdates! I have colleagues!

Do their parents know they're here?!

No, but if you keep screaming,
maybe they'll hear you!

That your dad?

She grows any more hair on her face, yes.

Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?

Three. I designed the engine myself.

Cool. Can it break Mach 1?

Oh, probably, if I could get
my hands on that new fuel...

the government's been working on.

Oh, this just might be your lucky day.

Howard, what happened to
the Oreos I left on the counter?!

I haven't seen your Oreos!

Just take your bath without them!

So why was it his lucky day?

It turns out I had a little rocket fuel
in the apartment.

What were you doing with
rocket fuel in your apartment?

Joyce Kim was curious
about what I did for a living...

and I was gonna
kind of show it to her.

The point is, the guys and I
went back to the apartment.

 Are we ever gonna get to the elevator?
 We're close. We're at the apartment.

The trick is to mix it into Tovex in
order to create a combustible gel...

that will generate over
8000 kilonewtons of thrust.

 Cool.
 Nice.

Won't work.

Excuse me, but I've been
working on this a long time.

Trust me, it'll work.

You don't see your mistake, do you?

There's no mistake.

This is for a full scale rocket,
not a model.

 Well, I've adjusted the formula.
 Not correctly.

Okay, I've had it with you.

You might be an expert on theoretical
physics and science fiction programs...

and where to sit on a freaking couch,
but this is applied physics.

And when it comes to applied physics...
Uh-oh.

 What's happening?
 A bad thing. A very bad thing.

Get the door.

Get the door. Get the door. Get the door.

 You're waiting for the elevator?
 Oh, right.

 Wait. It's here.
 Ah!

Give me that.

What'd you do that for?
I had plenty of time.

You're welcome.

Not only did Sheldon save my life,
he didn't rat me out to the landlord.

Or the police. Or Homeland Security.

So you're the reason...

I have to walk up and down
three flights of stairs every day?

So I did something stupid.
I'm sure you did stupid things.

What were you doing seven years ago?

Excuse me, I was in high school.
Studying, keeping my nose clean...

doing volunteer work
for the community.

Not pregnant. Yes!

Ha, ha!

Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favorite
Linux-based operating system.

 Hey.
 Hello.

Why do I smell methacrylate?

Oh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi.

Men can get those.

Anyway, I may owe you an apology.

There's doubt?

I did agree to the thermostat setting
and I shouldn't have tried to change it.

That's not an apology.

That's simply an acknowledgment
that I was right.

 Okay, I'm sorry.
 There you go.

So we're good?

 Good what?
 Never mind.

 Okay if I watch some TV?
 Go ahead.

Up next: Babylon 5.

 You're not even watching.
 I can hear it.

Oh, so the dialogue offends you?

I would hardly call that dialogue.

You are insane, you know that?

Don't make me turn that flag
upside down because you know I'll do it.



So, what kind of cruise is this
you're going on?

It's called
the Born Again Boat Ride.

Christian Quarterly gave it
their highest rating: Five thorny crowns.

I do wish you'd come with me,
Sheldon.

Oh, well, Mom, if I did,
it would be conclusive proof...

that your God can work miracles.

You're missing out. It's gonna be
wall-to-wall fun. It's all themed.

There's Jonah-and-the-whale
watching.

All you can eat
Last Supper Buffet.

And my personal favorite,
Gunning with God.

What's Gunning with God?
I'm afraid to ask, heh.

Oh, it is a hoot and a half.

You write your sins
on a clay pigeon...

they fire them up in the air, and you
pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun...

full of our Lord's forgiveness.

Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see
how advanced your group has become...

willing to sail out into the ocean
without fear of falling off the edge.

For example, if Shelly was aboard,
he'd write "smart mouth" on his pigeon.


The Lord giveth
and the Lord bloweth away.

Well, Mom, according to my itinerary
for our weekend together...

 ...the fun begins with fried chicken.
 Sounds delicious.

Good, because I got you everything
you need to make it.

You are in for a treat.

My mother's fried chicken
is why we had to buy my dad...

the extra-large coffin.

Sheldon, she just got off the plane.
She doesn't wanna cook.

Of course she does.

Making me food is her way of saying
"I love you."

Making me food when too tired...

is her way of saying
"I really love you."

I wouldn't mind going out
for a bite, Sheldon.

Won't that spoil our appetites
for the chicken you're gonna make?

All right.
We're going out. You like sushi?

There's a great place down the street.

I've never had it, but there's no harm
in trying something new.

There's a lot of harm
in trying something new.

That's why we test out drugs
and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.

Sheldon, you're talking
like a crazy person.

Actually, I had him tested as a child.

Doctor says he's fine.

 Told you.
 I do regret not following up...

with that specialist in Houston.


Stop yelling.

I'm not happy about this.

What's the last thing
you were ever happy about?

The prospect of fried chicken.

This is exciting.

Back home, the diner
on Route 4 serves sushi...

but it's just cut up fish sticks
and a side of Uncle Ben's.

They put it on the menu in those kung fu
letters, but that don't make it sushi.

Uh, "Kung fu letters"
might not be politically correct.

Oh, I thought the one
we couldn't say was "ching chong."

Yeah, yeah, that too.

So, Shelly, what's up with you
and your friend Amy...

if you don't mind
a mother prying a bit?

Well, there's actually big news
on the Amy front.

She's been studying the neurobiology
of addiction in lower animals.

She's this close to getting a starfish
hooked on cocaine.

You have any idea
what's going on with those two?

Hmm. It's kind of like
the Loch Ness monster.

Maybe there's something there,
maybe there isn't. We'll never know.

But sometimes it's fun to creep
yourself out thinking about it.

How are you doing
on the young lady front?

I hear you're in some sort
of a long-distance situation?

Uh. Yeah, it's Raj's sister.

It's kind of tough. She's in India.

Her parents aren't happy
she's dating someone white.

Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it?

Because you... You never think about it
going the other way.

Well, you can't force things.

Figure out if you're in a relationship or if
you're just calling it one. Like they say:

"A cat can have kittens in the oven,
but that don't make them biscuits."

That reminds me of another saying:

"You can lead a chicken to Crisco,
but you can't make your mother fry it."

You pester me one more time
about chicken...

I will put you over my knee
right here in this restaurant.

Please pester her. Please, for me.

Mrs. Cooper,
what did you think of the sushi?

Good. The only thing that would have
made it better, if it was cooked.

And if it was beef.

Sheldon, when is your landlord
gonna fix the elevator?

I don't know.

Lately, we've been talking
about converting it into a missile silo.

Your son seems to think we need to
launch a preemptive strike on Burbank.

Get them before they get us.

Hey, look who decided to show up.

Raj, what are you doing?

Well, I couldn't find you guys
so I bought six new friends.

Three, sadly, are dead.

Mom, you remember Rajesh?
Rajesh, my mother.

Of course. Mrs. Cooper.
So nice to see you again.

Well, it's so nice to see you too. Heh.

I thought it was our Indians
that had the occasional alcohol problem.

We don't say that, either.

I'll make you a list.

Oh, that would be
mighty white of you.

So, Raj, what pain
are you trying to cover up...

with alcohol?

 Nothing, I'm fine.
 Are you?

No.

That's better.
Now, tell me what's bothering you.

I'm so lonely.

Oh, yes, born alone, die alone.
It's a tragic human condition.

Now, Raj,
if you'll excuse my mother...

she's about to make a pecan pie
that'll be so good...

I'll almost forget how she blew it
with the fried chicken.

Sheldon, your friend is hurting.

What do we do
when someone's hurting?

Offer them a hot beverage.

When they're drunk as a skunk,
what beverage do we offer?

Coffee.

And what do we do it with?

Now, you listen to me.

I know you feel
like you can't find someone...

but there's a lock for every key.

Back home, there's a girl works
at the Walmart. Tall, tall girl.

Woman could hunt geese with a rake.

Thought she'd never find a man,
then one day, wouldn't you know...

Harlem Globetrotters come to town.

Long story short,
today that woman travels the world...

with a semiprofessional
basketball player...

and two beautiful
mixed-race babies.

I didn't get a lot of that
because of your accent...

but the general tone was soothing
and somehow I feel better. Ha, ha.

I'm not gonna get my pecan pie,
am I?

You want some Oreos?

 Double Stuf?
 No, it's regular.

Nice. Kick a man when he's down.

I'm glad we're finally getting to do
something together, just the two of us.

Sure. One thing you really miss
when you're on vacation is laundry.

Careful,
you're using too much Downy.

You know if my clothes
get too soft it makes me sleepy.

Well, this takes me back. Me doing
your laundry, you next to me criticizing.

It is nice, isn't it?


Mrs. Cooper.

 Hi.
 Oh, hello, darling.

Sheldon, you didn't tell me
your mom was coming.

It was in my weekly e-mail blast.

Right between
"Beet season is finally here"...

and "Uh-oh, red stool from beets
leads to cancer scare."

 So how have you been?
 Good, good.

Leonard has a new girlfriend.
How are you doing with all that?

Oh, fine. You know, it's, been a while.
I'm getting back out there.

Let me ask you, when you get back
out there, are you wearing this?

Well, it's super cute on.

That top has paid for itself in free drinks,
like, 10 times what it cost.

Yes, Penny has a lot of money
tied up in promiscuity futures.

Hon, you think maybe the reason
why you're having trouble...

finding a guy is because you're letting
them ride the roller coaster...

without buying a ticket?

Oh, they don't always get to ride
the roller coaster.

Sometimes they only get to spin
the teacups.

I'm going out. Would it be crazy to ask
you to look at the outfit I'm gonna wear?

Oh, not crazy at all.
And don't beat yourself up.

When I was your age,
you could have me for a car ride...

 ...and a bottle of strawberry wine.
 Ha, ha.

Yeah, that will not be
in this week's e-mail blast.

So this spring, I get to go
to the International Space Station.

Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens.

If you ever wanna live there eternally,
I've got a good book you could read.

I watch the Charlie Brown
Christmas Special every year...

so I get the gist.

I bet your mom is really proud of you.

Nope. She says if I don't back out,
she's gonna go on a hunger strike.

Um, it would take years before she'd be
in any kind of danger, but still.

I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom.

I'm taking you to see
Saul Perlmutter give a lecture...

about his Nobel Prize-winning
work in cosmology.

And the best part is,
at the Q and A afterward...

I've worked up a couple of
Q's that will stump his sorry A.

I don't know, Shelly. I thought we could
do a little sightseeing.

What sight is better than your little boy
embarrassing a Nobel laureate?

Come on, we'll take your mom
to see the Hollywood sign...

the Wax Museum,
the Walk of Fame.

Ooh. Maybe a little Rodeo Drive.

Well, I can't spend $12,000
on a handbag...

but it's free to look upon those
who do with righteous condemnation.

 What do you say?
 What do I say?

I say you people need to stop ruining
my mom's visit with your sushi...

and your sadness
and your slutty shirts.

Stop it.

He's not talking about your shirt.
Your shirt is fine.

These are delicious.

The trick to pancakes is bacon grease.
I cook everything in it.

Everything?
Aren't you worried about your health?

Doctors are always changing
their mind.

One week bacon grease
is bad for you.

Next week
we're not getting enough of it.

Good morning, Shelly.

Mom, I want to apologize
for my behavior last night.

Apology accepted.

Great. Now, you're gonna love
the Perlmutter lecture.

Look, he will be stating that the universe
is older than 6000 years...

but you could stick
your fingers in your ears...

and hum "Amazing Grace"
during those parts.

I am still going out with your friends.

But I apologized.

And that was hard for me
because I didn't do anything wrong.

Shelly, I hung out with you
in enough dusty lecture halls...

while you were growing up.
I wanna go sightseeing.

So why don't you have some pancakes,
get dressed and come with us.

I'm not going, and you can't make me.

You're right, I can't. Have a nice day.

Well, I'm going to stand here
until you change your mind.

Then you are gonna stand there
all day.

I'm just gonna take my bacon grease
and slide over there.

I can't believe my own mother
is abandoning me.

I am not abandoning you.

Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you
in a basket on a church doorstep.

I am going to Hollywood
and thank a wax Ronald Reagan...

for his service to our country.

We appear to be at a crossroads
in our relationship, Mother.

 Well, I guess we are.
 Sorry. Syrup.

All right, Mom. When you're at
the Ripley's Believe it Or Not Museum...

if they have an exhibit about a mother
who threw away a chance...

to spend a day with the world's
most wonderful son, believe it, it's true.

I hadn't...

That lecture was a waste of time.

I made more accurate diagrams
of the expansion of the early universe...

on the nursery wall
with the contents of my diaper.


Are you getting sick?

No, I'm just allergic to people who get
Nobel Prizes for no good reason.

Sheldon, is it possible
that your foul mood or...

to use the clinical term, bitchiness...

is because your mother
isn't making you a priority?


Are you sure?
The infant-mother pair-bond...

is the building block
of primate psychology.

Oh, there it is. It always comes back
to monkeys with you.

Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.

Sheldon, we're all animals.

There are aspects of you
that are extraordinary...

but when it comes to relationships,
you're like everybody else.

Are you trying to suggest
that my emotional problems...

are no different
than those of a stupid person?

Actually, some research indicates
that by not overthinking...

the less intelligent
handle emotions better.


Sure you're not coming down
with a cold?

Oh, yes, the common cold.
Just like everyone else.

You'd love that, wouldn't you?

Oh, this one's sweet.

You know, for your rosary rattlers.

Mrs. Cooper, we say "Catholics,"
not "rosary rattlers."

My goodness, it's a wonder
you people in California can talk at all.

This is like the worst Hollywood
tour ever.

Now, dude, she wanted to see churches.

Hey, they have wine here, don't they?

Hey, none of our gods
have abs like that.

Yep, that's the last Jew
who did sit-ups.

And look where it got him.

Hey, while we're here,
why don't we all do some praying?

Let's put a little church in this church.

Oh, I'm not sure we should...

It's easy. I'll show you how.

Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you
from Gomorrah, California.

I want to thank you
for the blessing that is my little Shelly.

I also want to thank you
for the continued strength...

not to coldcock him with my Bible.

All right, Penny, your turn.

Okay, um, ahem. Hey, God. What's up?

Um. I'm good, but it would be a big help
to my family...

if you could get my brother
to stop cooking meth.

But no cops. Be cool.

She also goes a little overboard
on the "love thy neighbor."

Could probably use that chat
you had with Mary Magdalene.

Leonard, you're up.
Wasserman, you're on deck.

Okay. I don't know.

It's probably a little late to ask you
to make me taller.

Oh, um...

If you could help out with my girlfriend.
She's all the way in India.

 That would be great.
 Hear that? Girl trouble.

Turns out we were both wrong
on that front.

 How about you?
 Uh, me? No. Thanks, I'm good.

I'm really just trying not to burst
into flames. Heh.

Rajesh?

Uh, he says he's having trouble
dropping those last five pounds.

Huh. I might have gone
with the talking-to-girls thing.


No, you only get one wish.

Look at the two of us.

Me, a highly regarded physicist.

The kind of mind that comes along once,
maybe twice in a generation.

You, the common man...

tired from your labors
as a stockbroker...

or vacuum cleaner salesman,
or bootblack.

But deep down inside...

apparently we're
just two peas in a pod.

Uh, a regular pea...

and the kind of pea that comes along
once, maybe twice in a generation.


Rain. Another great equalizer.

Falling on the head of the brilliant
and the unremarkable alike.

Smarty-pants.

 Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.
 You take notes, darling.

The real way to get a man is with melted
cheese and cream of mushroom soup.

He'll die at 50,
but his love will be true.

Brr.

I need a tissue. This one got wet.

 Here.
 Thank you.

Yeah, I've learned something today.

You and I, in so many ways...

other than intelligence
and what counts, we're the same.


Sweetheart, are you sick?

I hope so, because if this is well,
life isn't worth living.

Sugar pie, you are burning up.
We've got to get you to bed.

 Okay.
 Don't worry.

Mama's here to take care of her baby.

And just to be clear, only her baby
and not these other people.

Of course.

Can I have tea with honey
and toast with the crust cut off?

 You can have whatever you want.
 Brr. Thanks, Mom. You're the best.

Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you,
you didn't have hair on your chest.

I know, it filled in last year.

I didn't get to spend a lot of time
with you on this visit.

And whose fault was that?


Yours.

Shelly, you're not 8 years old anymore.
We have to have a different relationship.

No, we don't.

 The one we have works great.
 Sweetheart, you are a grown man.

Or maybe I'm part of a new species
that lives for years...

which means
I'm still basically a toddler.

Oh, I so should have taken you
to Houston.

Does this mean
you're not going to sing "Soft Kitty"?

No, I will always sing you
"Soft Kitty."

Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur

 Were we supposed to take that pie out?
 Get out!

Well, that was rude.

Well, I know, but he means well.

Sing.

Happy kitty, sleepy kitty...

What are you trying to pull, Mom?

From the top.

This is what I'm talking about.

Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur



Fellow warriors,

this is Sheldor the Conqueror.

We are about to enter
Axidus' fortress.

Now, this is a long run,
so let's do another bladder check.

OK, Barry,
we'll wait for you again,

but you really should see a doctor.

Sheldor is AFK.

Are you experiencing
some sort of difficulty?

Yes. I can't get
my stupid door open.

You appear to have put
your car key in the door lock,

are you aware of that?

All right, then.

Damn it.

Would it be possible for you
to do this a little more quietly?

I can't get
the damn key out.

It's not surprising--
that Baldwin lock on your door

uses traditional
edge-mounted cylinders,

whereas the key for your Volkswagen
uses a center cylinder system.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Point of inquiry: why did you put
your car key in the door lock?

Why?
Because today I had an audition,

it took me two hours to get there,

I waited an hour for my turn,
and before I could even start,

they told me I looked
too Midwest for the part.

Too Midwest.
What the hell does that even mean?

The American Midwest was mostly settled
by Scandinavian and Germanic people.

They have a characteristic
facial bone...

I know what it means!

God! I have been in L.A.
for almost two years now,

and I haven't gotten
a single acting job.

I've accomplished nothing,

haven't gotten any raise at work,
haven't even had sex in 6 months,

and just now,
when I was walking up those stairs,

a fly flew in my mouth
and I ate it!

Actually, insects are a dietary staple
in many cultures.

They're almost pure protein.

Oh, son of a bitch!

I believe the condensation
on your frozen foods

weakened the structural
integrity of the bag.

But returning to your key conundrum,
perhaps you should call a locksmith

 and have him open the door for you.
 I did.

He said he'll get here
when he gets here.

You're frustrated
because he phrased his reply

in the form
of a meaningless tautology?

I am frustrated because
I am a failure at everything

and my breath smells like fly.

There, there.

Would you prefer to wait
in our apartment?

No, I'd rather sit
on this freezing-cold floor

sobbing like a three-year-old.

All right, then.

For God's sake.

Just when I think
I've gotten the hang of sarcasm.


Make yourself comfortable.

Not there.

Sheldor is back online.

Sheldor?

The Conqueror.

What are you doing?

AFK.

I'm playing Age of Conan,
an online multiplayer game

set in the universe of
Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian.

Sheldor back online.

 What's "AFK"?
 AFK.

Away From Keyboard.

Oh, I see.

What does that stand for?

Oh, I see.

Yes, but what does
it stand for?

Just click on the enchanted boots
to put them on.

I don't know--
can I see them in another color?

Just click on them.

Congratulations.

You are now a level-three warrior.

 What's going on?
 Guess what? I'm a level-three warrior.

Great.

Do you know there are groceries
outside of your apartment?

I only bring it up because
your ice cream's melting

and it's starting
to attract wildlife.

Do I stay in the jungle
or go towards the beach?

It doesn't matter-- right now;
you're looking for treasure.

 Wait, where are you going?
 No, no. You're okay.

If you run into crocodiles,
just kick them with your boots.

You want to catch me up?

Well, let's see,

she attempted to open
her apartment with her car key

because her face
is overly Midwestern...

she hasn't had sex in six months...

and she ate a fly.

Seriously?
Six months?

Oh, my God!
A treasure chest! I'm rich!

Level three,
and she thinks she's rich.

What a newb.

We're all set.

Let her rip.

Check it out--
it's just corn starch and water.

They make up a non-Newtonian fluid,
which is liquid,

but solid under the percussive
action of the speaker.

That's what makes it get all funky.

Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.

No, that's what she said--
Sheldon.

I bought the game, and I've been
exploring the island of Tortage,

but I don't know
how to get past the Guard Captain.

 Do you have the Enchanted Sword?
 No, I have a bronze dagger.

You can't slay the Guard
with a bronze dagger.

My Lord, it's like the car key
in your apartment door all over again.

 All right, how do I get the sword?
 Have you been to the Temple of Mitra?

Is that the place on the hill
with the weird priest in front of it?

 It's... Oh, for God's sakes, gimme.
 Thank you-- I really appreciate.

You're gonna have to learn
to do these things for yourself.

Don't patronize me--
just get the sword!

What the frack?

Beats me.
They were playing all last night, too.

It's like some kind
of weird comic book crossover.

Like if Hulk were dating
Peppermint Patty.

I always thought
Peppermint Patty was a lesbian.

No, that's Marcie.

Peppermint Patty's just athletic.

There you go--
one Enchanted Sword.

All right, gimme, gimme.
I want to kill the Guard Captain.

That girl needs to get a life.

Danger! Danger!

No danger-- it's just me, Penny.
Listen, I got to level 25

and reached Purple Lotus Swamp.

You're in my bedroom.

 Leonard gave me an emergency key.
 People can't be in my bedroom.

 Can we go talk in the living room?
 I'm not wearing pajama bottoms.

 Why not?
 I spilled grape juice.

Wear different pajamas.

I can't wear different pajamas--
these are my Monday pajamas.

People cannot be in my bedroom.

Fine, just tell me, is it too soon
to join a quest to the Black Castle?

You were invited on a quest
to the Black Castle?

By some guys in Budapest.

I'm just not sure it's the right move
for my character.

Of course it's not--
you're only a level 25.

These Hungarians, they're just
using you for dragon fodder.

Really? Boy, you'd think you could trust
a horde of Hungarian barbarians.

Please, Penny, enough.
I have to sleep.

Okay, you were great.
Thanks.

Listen, don't go in Sheldon's room.
He's not wearing bottoms.

Sheldon, you want
to catch me up again?

People, I'm very busy today.

I realize that, Dr. Gablehauser,

but it's your job,
as head of the department,

to mediate
all interdepartmental disputes.

University Policy Manual,
Chapter Four, Subsection Two:

"Mediation
of Interdepartmental Disputes."

Fine.

Dr. Winkle, what colorful name
did you call Dr. Cooper this time?

Dr. Dumb-Ass.

Dr. Cooper,
Dr. Winkle apologizes.

 I don't.
 She doesn't.

Here's the problem.
I was clearly signed up

to use the mainframe in Buckman 204,

and Dr. Winkle just wantonly
ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.

It wasn't an official sign-up sheet.
He printed it himself,

and he put his name down
on every slot for the next 6 months.

If it is a crime to ensure
that the university's resources

are not being squandered
chasing subatomic wild geese,

then I plead guilty.

 Penny!
 Do you need to get that, Dr. Cooper?

God, no.

Don't turn it off, you might miss
your call from the Nobel committee

telling you you've been nominated
as Dumb-Ass Laureate of the Year.

Oh, yeah? Well...

you wouldn't even be nominated.

Dr. Gablehauser, I have a series

of important calculations
and simulations to run.

All she's doing is
reducing irrelevant data

 and making a mock...
 Excuse me.

It's for you.

Penny, this is not a good time.

No, I told you,

you're not prepared
for the Sanctum of Burning Souls.

You need to be in a group
of at least 5 for that quest

and one should be
a level 35 healer.

I can't log on and help you.

We'll talk when I get home.

I'm not getting
the computing time, am I?

Dumb-ass.

Leonard, you have to do
something about Penny.

She is interfering with my sleep,
she's interfering with my work,

and if I had another significant
aspect of my life,

I'm sure she'd be interfering
with that, too.

Why should I do something?
You introduced her to online gaming.

Yes, but you're the one who said hello
to her when she moved in.

If you'd simply restrained yourself,
none of this would be happening.

 Just tell her to leave you alone.
 I did, I told her,

I texted her, I sent out
a very emphatic twitter.

I even changed my Facebook
status to

"Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny
would leave him alone."

I don't know what else to do.

 Well, what am I supposed to do?
 I don't know,

but if you don't figure something out,
I warn you,

I shall become
very difficult to live with.

You mean up until now
we've been experiencing

the happy, fun-time Sheldon?

 Yes.
 I'll go talk to her.

No, Fritz, I need you on my flank.

No, I don't know German.
Flanken sie, flanken sie.

 Hey, Penny.
 Busy.

Yeah, I see that.
Shouldn't you be at work?

I don't work on Mondays.

It's Thursday.

 Listen, Penny...
 Queen Penelope, AFK. What...?

Here's the thing.

Sometimes people,
good people,

start playing these games
and they find themselves,

through no fault of their own,
kind of... addicted.

Get to the point.
I'm about to level up here.

If a person doesn't have a sense
of achievement in their real life,

it's easy to lose themselves
in a virtual world

where they can get a false
sense of accomplishment.

Yeah, jabber, jabber.
Boys, Queen Penelope's back online.

Penny, you've got...

Cheetos in your hair.

Thanks.

Hey, Penny, it's me again, Leonard.

I said not now.

I know, I'm just a little
concerned about you.

I said not now!

Okay, maybe later.

Hey, guys.

 What's with him?
 Penny's been keeping him up at night.

Me, too.

But probably in a different way.

She's gotten really
hooked on Age of Conan.

 She's playing nonstop.
 Yes, online gaming addiction.

There's nothing worse than having
that multi-player monkey on your back.

 Sheldon, wake up!
 Danger! Danger!

Afternoon, men.

Your attempt at juvenilizing me

by excluding me from the set
of adult males, just...

I'm too tired to do this.

I heard you've been pulling all-nighters
with Middle Earth Barbie.

She comes into my room.
No one's supposed to be in my room.

I would postulate that she's escaping
into the online world

to compensate
for her sexual frustration.

I do that, too.

But probably in a different way.

That's not what she's doing, Leslie.

She's just trying to shore up
her self-esteem.

 It has nothing to do with sex.
 Everything has to do with sex.

Testify.

I'm not touching that.

You are way off base here.

Hang on.

While I have no respect
for Leslie as a scientist

or a human being,
for that matter,

we have to concede her
undeniable expertise

in the interrelated fields
of promiscuity and general sluttiness.

Thank you.

My point is that Tinkerbell
just needs to get her some.

Some what?

Yes, some sexual intercourse.

I'll take the bullet.

Excuse me,
this whole idea is insane.

Enough debate,
I'm going to take action.

Excuse me.

Are you currently involved
in a sexual relationship?

Would you like to be?

Sure, why not?

Can I have your phone number?

There. Problem solved.

Dumb-ass.

Okay, I'm at the gate
of the Treasury of the Ancients.

 I'm going in.
 Stay close to the wall.

 Avoid the mummies.
 Got it.

I must say you're playing very well
for a woman of 23.

 Twenty-two.
 Right, 22.

Here come the mummies.
Which spell do I use,

the hateful strike
or the frenzy stance?

What happened to your group?

I dumped them,
they're a bunch of wussies.

 Frenzy stance.
 Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!

So, listen,

would you describe
your ideal vacation

as a wild adventure
to unknown lands

or staying at home curled up
with a good book?

 What?
 These are market research questions.

I'm filling out the online
registration for your game.

Okay, wild adventure.

Frenzy stance isn't working.
Die, you undead mummy, die!

 Healing potion.
 Thank you.

You're welcome.

Anyhow, on a scale
of one to five,

with one being
always initiated by him

and five being
always initiated by you,

how do you prefer
your sexual encounters to begin?

 That's on the registration?
 Yes, it's quite extensive.

But if we complete it,
you get a free expansion pack.

75 additional quests.

Awesome. I totally like to initiate.
I'm a big ol' five.

Good to know.

Big ol' five.

Leonard, this is Tom.

Hi, Tom. Sheldon...

Didn't I explain to you

about your little mistake
in the cafeteria?

You were very clear.
As was everyone else at the table.

Tom, however,
has been chosen by science

as a suitable mate for Penny.

Chosen by science?

Well, what passes for science
on dating sites.

They claim to use
heuristic algorithms,

but it may well be hokum.

You got Penny to sign up
for online dating?

No, of course not.

See, I used trickery and deceit.

This is bad.

Tom is a paramedic
with the fire department,

but he's going to med school at night.

He likes the outdoors

and strong women
who initiate sex.

Really, really bad.

I'm surprised
you struck out with Penny.

Apparently,
she's a big ol' five.

 Sheldon, what do you want?
 Good,

you got my note.
I'd like you to meet Tom.

Penny, this is Tom.

Tom, may I present Penny.

 Hi, Penny.
 Yeah, hi. Listen,

as long as I'm here,
I'm on a quest with a bunch of newbs.

We've got one assassin,
3 spell casters and no tank.

 Can we talk about this later?
 No, no. I need you now.

Wouldn't you prefer
to socialize with Tom,

who is a sexually passive
outdoorsman?

Whatever.
I'll figure it out myself.

Bye, Penny.

I'm sorry, dude, she didn't look
anything like her picture.

They never do.

 Hello, fair Penny.
 Who are you?

It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz.

Can I interest you
in an afternoon of spirited questing

followed by a flagon of ale
at Yon Virtual Tavern?

Yeah, sure, why not?

Oh, my God, I need help.



And now the
kung pao chicken.

Ah, yeah.
Wow.

Smooth.

And finally,

my moo shu pork.

Whoo-hoo!

Oh, there you have
it, gentlemen.

Our entire dinner
unpacked by robot.

And it only took 28 minutes.

Impressive,

but we must be cautious.
Why?

Today, it's a Chinese food
retrieval robot.

Tomorrow,
it travels back in time

and tries to kill Sarah Connor.

I don't think that's
going to happen, Sheldon.

No one ever does.

That's why it happens.

Hey. Is the food here?

Ooh. What's that?

That, dear lady,

is the Wolowitz
Programmable Hand,

designed
for extravehicular repairs

on the International
Space Station.

Ah, cool.

Ask me to pass the soy sauce.

Oh, does that come up much
on the space station?

Mostly with Asian
and Jewish astronauts.

All right. Pass the soy sauce.
Coming up.

So how's work?

Oh, it's not bad.

Kind of hungry.

Yeah, we all are.

Just wait.

You realize, Penny,
that the technology

that went into this arm
will one day make

unskilled food servers
such as yourself obsolete.

Really?

They're going to make a robot
that spits on your hamburger?

I thought you
broke up with her.

Why is she here?

Okay, here we go.

Passing the soy sauce.

Put out your hand.

Oh!

That's amazing.

I wouldn't say amazing.

At best,
it's a modest leap forward

from the basic technology

that gave us
Country Bear Jamboree.

Hey, Sheldon?

Yes?

Peace?

No, not peace.

Hang on.

 


Does NASA know you're using
that thing as a napkin holder?

You kidding? They still think
it's in a secure locker at JPL.

You stole it?

Borrowed.

The trick is to carry it out
to your car like you own it.

Excuse me.

Oh.

Amy's at the dry cleaners,

and she's made a very
amusing pun.

"I don't care
for perchloroethylene,

and I don't like glycol ether."

Get it?

She doesn't like glycol ether.

Sounds like "either."

"L-O-L."

Who's Amy?
His girlfriend.

Sheldon has a girlfriend?
She's not my girlfriend.

How long
has this been going on?
Four months.

She's not my girlfriend.
Are you telling me, for
the past four months

I have been asking you,
"What's new?"

and you never thought
to go with,

"Sheldon has a girlfriend"?

She's not my girlfriend.

Ah... d-d-d-d...

How did they meet?

Raj and I entered Sheldon's
information on a dating site,

and it spit out
Amy Farrah Fowler.

Oh, my God!
Sheldon and Amy.

Or, as we
call them, "Shamy."

Shamy.

I am so digging the Shamy.

All right,
everyone pay attention.

Yes, I have a friend
named Amy Farrah Fowler.

Yes, she is female.

Yes, we communicate
on a daily basis,

but no, she is not
my girlfriend.

Okay, well, what do
you communicate about?

Well, my work in physics,
her work in neurobiology,

and most recently,
the possibility

of our having a child together.

Thank you.

Wait a minute-- a child?

You never see this girl.

You just e-mail
and text and Twitter.

Now you're considering
having a baby?

Amy pointed out
that between the two of us,

our genetic material
has the potential

of producing the first in a line

of intellectually superior,
benign overlords

to guide humanity
to a brighter tomorrow.

I'm guessing
that future historians

will condemn us
for not taking

this opportunity
to kill Sheldon.

Okay, I have
a question.

Yes, Penny.

You don't even like people
touching you.

How are you going to have sex?

Why on Earth would we have sex?

Oh, honey, did your mom
not have the talk with you?

You know, when your
private parts started growing?

I'm quite aware of the way
humans usually reproduce,

which is messy,
unsanitary,

and based on living next
to you for three years,

involves loud and unnecessary
appeals to a deity.

Oh, God.

Yes, exactly.

Consequently,
if Amy and I choose

to bring new life
into this world,

it will be accomplished
clinically,

with fertility experts in a lab
with petri dishes.

Which reminds me--

you have broad hips
and a certain corn-fed vigor.

Is your womb available
for rental?

Still digging the Shamy?

Look, Sheldon,

before you race off to
the fertility clinic,

you might want
to think about--

uh, gee, I don't know--

maybe actually spending
some time with her.

You mean dating?
Yeah.

I can't date Amy.
Why not?

She's not my girlfriend.

Okay, look, don't think of it
as dating a girlfriend.

Think of it as, uh...

getting to know
the future mother of your child.

Oh.

I hadn't considered that.

I suppose she will have
to have access to our progeny.

And you don't think
I can achieve

the required intimacy
via text messaging?

Probably not.

Huh.

It would appear as if

the phone companies
have been lying to me.

Penny.

Penny. Penny.

You do realize I stand
on the other side of the door

waiting for you to finish
knocking three times.

I know. I can see the shadow
of your feet under the door.

Yeah, my point is
it's a waste of time.

If you're looking for an example

of a waste of time,
I would refer you

to the conversation
we're having right now.

What do you want?

I've decided to take your advice
and have arranged

to go on a date
with Amy Farrah Fowler.

Oh, that's great.

Have fun.
Wait.

You have to drive me.

What?
You know I don't drive.

Well, go ask Leonard.
I did.

He said-- and I quote--
"Ask Penny.

It was her cockamamy idea."

Leonard said "cockamamy"?

Actually, I'm paraphrasing.

Having been raised
in a Christian household,

I'm uncomfortable
with the language he used.

And to be honest,

I'm not entirely comfortable
with "cockamamy."

Okay, fine. When's the date?

Now.
Now?

Hurry. We're going to be late.

Sheldon,
did it ever occur to you

that I might have other plans?

I'm sorry.

Do you have other plans?

Well, no, not per se, but...

So this conversation
is as pointless

as your door-knocking soliloquy?

Let me get my...
cockamamy keys.

Oh, God, that feels so good.

Yeah, that's the spot.

Oh, baby.

MRS. WOLOWITZ
Howard, dinner's ready!

I'll eat later.

I'm busy!

Oh, yeah.

Just like a real hand.

Hmm.

Thank you
for driving me.

You're welcome.

I wish you weren't
wearing flip-flops.

It's dangerous
to drive in flip-flops.

Sheldon.
Sorry.

I just don't want to be
yet another flip-flop fatality.

Can I ask you
a question?

Given your
community college education,

I encourage you to ask me
as many as possible.

Yeah.
Well, my question is--

and I'm pretty sure
I know the answer--

is this your first date?

That depends.

Does square-dancing
with my sister

at a Teens for Jesus
Fourth of July Hoedown

count as a date?

No.

Then, this is my first date.

Okay. Well, then,
there's a couple of things

you should probably know.

I have a master's degree
and two doctorates.

The things I should know,
I do know.

My point is, I know more
about dating than you,

and if you were as smart
as you think you are,

you would listen to me.

If you know so much,
how come I have a date tonight

and you have nothing better
to do than drive me to it?

Fair point.

You know,
there's something

I've always wondered
about Aquaman.

Yeah?
Where does he poop?

What?

What would a toilet
look like in Atlantis?

How would you flush it?

And when you did flush it,
where would the poop go?

Hold that thought.

Hey, Howard.
What's going on?

What...

Hold on.
Howard, Howard, slow down.

The robot hand
is stuck on your what?

You're not going
to believe this.

So, um, Amy,
Sheldon tells me

you're a neuro...
something-or-other.

Neurobiologist.

Your "check engine" light is on.

Yeah, it's okay.

But the light indicates...

Don't bother.

I've wasted many an hour

tilting at
that particular windmill.

Uh, what is that
scent you're wearing?

It smells great.

Dandruff shampoo.

I have dry scalp.

Ah.

Well, your hair
looks very nice.

Are you a homosexual?

No, no, I'm just giving
you a compliment.

Hmm.

Would have been more flattered
if you were a homosexual.

Guys, how 'bout
some music?

Oh, no, I wouldn't
care for that.

Amy?

No, thank you.

Okay.

Uncomfortable
silence it is.

Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy

what it was like for you
growing up in Texas?

No.

Well, why don't
you tell her?

All right.

It was hell.

Any follow up, Amy?

No.

I myself grew
up in Nebraska.

Small town
outside of Omaha.

Nice place, mostly family farms,
a few meth labs.

I'm sorry, how is this better
than uncomfortable silence?

I don't know.

I was just trying something.

Muggles.

You slipped and fell
into a robot hand?

Yes.

Penis first?

Yes. Now, help me!

I'd suggest a lubricant,
but I have a feeling

you fell on some
of that as well.

Not funny, Leonard.

Really? A robot hand's got
a death grip on your junk, dude.

That's funny, ask anyone.

Plea-- before my mother
walks in, get this off me!

Okay, let's see.

No, no!
Don't touch.

The program
is paused.

Well, then let's
un-pause it.

No, no! I loaded
the wrong program.

The hand thinks it's holding
a screwdriver in outer space.

If you continue the program,
it's gonna start twisting.

A-All right.

Um, how about this.

When-when Winnie the Pooh
got his head stuck

in the honey tree,
his friends all grabbed onto him

and pulled and pulled.

You do what you want,

I'm not touching another
man's honey tree.

All right, uh,
forget pulling.

How about we get
an electric saw and cut it off?

What?! No saws!

One circumcision was enough.

How about an
acetylene torch?

Okay, I can't believe
this needs to be said out loud.

No pulling, no saws, no torches.

Well, then what do
you want us to do?

MRS. WOLOWITZ
Howard, I made cookies for you

and your little friends!

That's great, Mom, thanks!

I'll bring them up
with some Hawaiian Punch!

Don't come up here!

Why not?! Are you
ashamed of your mother?!

Yes, but that's not the point!

Get me out of here.

You have any ideas, Raj?

Right now, all I can think about
is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.

Hey, here's another possible
topic of conversation.

This is a big night for Sheldon.

Right, Sheldon?

Big night?

The winter solstice
is a big night.

It's over 14 hours

in Southern California.

That's an amusing factoid.

Thank you.

No, no.

My point is, uh, tonight is
Sheldon's first official date.

Discuss.

Is this true?

Apparently, a semi-incestuous
Teens for Jesus

Fourth of July Hoedown
didn't count.

So, um, Amy, what about you?

Do you date much?

Once a year.

It's a deal I made
with my mother in exchange for

her silence on the matter,
as well as the occasional use

of her George Foreman Grill

that seals in the flavor
without the fat.

How about you, Penny?

Do you go on many dates?

Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many.

A few.

What's...
?

Your characterization of

approximately 171 different men
as "a few."

What...

Where did you
get 171 men?

Simple extrapolation.

In the three years
that I've known you,

you were single for two.

During that time,
I saw 17 different suitors.

If we work backwards,
correcting for observation bias

and postulate an initial
dating age of 15...

Whoa, wait,
wait, wait.

I did not start dating at 15.

I'm sorry. Sixteen?

Fourteen.

My mistake.

Now, assuming the left side
of a bell curve

peaking around the present,
that would bring the total

up to 193 men.

Plus or minus eight men.

Remarkable.

Did you have sexual intercourse
with all of these men?

No.

Although that number would be

fairly easy
to calculate.
Oh.

Based on the number of
awkward encounters I've had

with strange men leaving
her apartment in the morning,

plus the number of times

she's returned home
wearing the same clothes

she wore the night before...

Okay, Sheldon, I think
you've made your point.

So we multiply 193--

minus 21 men
before the loss of virginity--

so 172

times 0.18 gives us...

30.96 sexual partners.

Let's round that up to 31.

Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong.

That is not even close
to the real number.

I'm gonna need
a drink over here.

This is very interesting.

Cultural perceptions
are subjective.

Penny, to your mind,
are you a slut?

No! No!

No.

Let's just all finish
our dinners, okay?

This is
an interesting topic.

How many sexual encounters
have you had?

Does volunteering
for a scientific experiment

in which orgasm was achieved
by electronically

stimulating the pleasure centers
of the brain count?

I should think so.

Then 128.

Okay, come on.

Almost there.

Don't tug.
No tugging.

Next time, take your own advice.

Excuse me,
could you help us out?

My, my, my.

What do we have here?

I slipped and fell.

Yeah, we get that a lot.

What is this?

It's a robot arm.

Where's the rest of the robot?

I only built the arm.

'Cause that's all
you needed, right?

Can you please
just help me?!

All right, all right.

Hang on, stay calm.

I need an orderly
with a wheelchair.

I got a robot hand grasping
a man's penis out here.

You think you could be
a little more discreet?

I'm sorry,
we don't have a code for

"robot hand
grasping a man's penis."

Why is it hooked up
to a computer?

Uh, it's what
controls the arm.

But it's frozen.

Did you try turning it off
and back on again?

No, you see, it's more
complicated than that.

No, wait!

Winnie the Pooh
is out of the honey tree.

Now can we have cookies
and Hawaiian Punch?

You were right.

This was a very
productive evening.

I saw a whole new side of
Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.

I did not have
sex with 31 guys.

I'll be happy
to check the math,

but numbers
don't lie, Penny.

In any event,

now that Amy and I have
spent quality time together,

I feel much
more confident

proceeding to the next
stage of our relationship.

And that is?

Using in vitro
fertilization

and a surrogate uterus to
gift humanity with our progeny.

You're still
on that?

In these uncertain times,
doesn't humanity deserve a gift?

Okay, you know what?

I'm gonna come at this
in a whole new way.

Sheldon, if you try to make
a baby with Amy in a petri dish,

I'm gonna tell
your mother on you.

That's no threat.

My mother's always
wanted a grandchild.

Really? Your deeply religious
born-again Christian mother

wants a test-tube grandbaby
born out of wedlock?

Curses.

If I'd thought of that
in the first place,

I could've saved myself
this whole night.

Well, it's not that late.

You could still go out
and look for number 32.

Good night.

Hey, Howard,
what's up?

I've decided
not to procreate.

Yeah, yeah, great.

Howard, uh, slow down.

What do you mean
it happened again?



Okay, in Avatar
when they have sex on Pandora...

they hook up their ponytails.

So we know their ponytails
are like their junk.

Yeah. So?

When they ride horses
and fly on birds...

 ...they also use their ponytails.
 Your point?

My point is if I were a horse or a bird I'd
be very nervous around James Cameron.

It amazes me how you constantly
obsess over fictional details...

when there are important things
in the world to worry about.

For example, why wasn't William
Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?

Hey, Sheldon,
I was up in the administration office...

and I happened to overhear
the name of the winner...

of the
Chancellor's Award for Science.

You wanna rub my nose in the fact my
contributions are being overlooked again?

I am the William Shatner
of theoretical physics.

All right, I'll play.

What self-important preening fraud
are they honoring this year?

Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that.
You.

 I won?
 You won.

I won.

This is astonishing.

Not that I won the award.
No one deserves it more.

Actually, I guess I misspoke.
It's not astonishing.

It's more like inevitable.

Not sure what to do.
Maybe call my mother.

Wait. I'm gonna conduct
an interview with myself...

and post it online.

Well, good for him.

Yeah, the one thing
the William Shatner...

of theoretical physics needed
was an ego boost.

Did it look like that spear was gonna
go right through your skull?

No.

Hey, you didn't want a Slurpee
at 7-Eleven, you don't get glasses.

Oh. That will be another
congratulatory call for me.

 Mute, please.
 Wait. Hang on. Flaming arrow.

Hello?

Oh, Chancellor Morton,
how are you, sir?

Yes, I was expecting your call.
Three years ago.

I see.

What happens if
I choose not to give a speech?

Uh-huh. And if I don't want to forfeit
the award?

Well, you've got that tied up
in a neat little bow.

All right, thank you.

 Problem.
 What?

They expect me to give a speech
at the banquet.

I can't give a speech.

Well, no, you're mistaken.
You give speeches all the time.

What you can't do is shut up.

Yeah, before the movie,
you did 20 minutes...

on why guacamole turns brown.

Turned brown
while you were talking.

I'm perfectly comfortable speaking
to small groups.

I cannot speak to large crowds.

What to you is a large crowd?

Any group big enough
to trample me to death.

General rule of thumb is 36 adults
or 70 children.

Sheldon. Congratulations.

Brought you cheesecake from work.

You know, because of your award,
not because that busboy sneezed on it.

 I'm not accepting the award.
 Why not?

Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper
has stage fright.

That's no reason to back out.

I once got a pretty big
honor in high school.

I was terrified about appearing
in front of a big crowd...

but I went through with it.
You know?

The world looked pretty darn good
sitting on a haystack...

in the back of a Ford F-150 as a
member of the corn queen's court.

Thank you. I'll bear that in mind...

if I'm ever nominated
for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.

 Sheldon, you're being ridiculous.
 Am I?

Let me tell you a story.

Where's 70 children
when you need them?

I was 14 and graduating
summa cum laude from college.

"Summa cum laude" is Latin
for "with highest honors."

I just love how you always skip over
the part where no one asks.

I was valedictorian
and expected to give an address.

Even now I can remember
that moment...

when I walked up to the podium
and looked out at the crowd.

There must have been
thousands of people.

My heart started pounding
in my chest.

I began to hyperventilate.

My vision became blurry,
and before I knew it...

Oh, dear.

 Oh, my God.
 Sheldon?

 Sheldon, are you okay?
 Don't trample me.

Come on, Mother, you know
why I can't accept the award.

With all due respect,
I don't think praying will help.

No, I have not heard the song
"Jesus, Take the Wheel."

No, no, no.
You don't need to start singing it.

Yes, I'll buy it on "the iTunes,"
Mother.

Goodbye, Mother.

Hello.

 Sit down. We wanna talk to you.
 Am I in trouble?

Did my mother call you?

Just sit.

We think we can help you
with your stage fright.

Oh, I doubt that.

I haven't figured out a way
and I'm much smarter than all of you.

Yes, but you're not smarter
than all of us put together.

Oh, I'm sorry.
That is what I meant.

Okay. Your problem is
you're trying to do this all by yourself.

We could help you.
We can be your team.

Like Professor Xavier
and his X-Men.

I do like the X-Men.

Did I see X-Men?

Yeah, we watched it last week.
You said you liked it.

Oh, I say a lot of things, sweetie.

So how about it, Sheldon?

I don't know. If you're my X-Men,
what are your powers?

Okay, well, I'm gonna take you
shopping, get you a nice suit.

 Might give you more confidence.
 It's not exactly a mutation...

that would get you into Xavier's
School for Gifted Youngsters...

but go on. Leonard?

I thought I could try to analyze you
and get to the root of your anxiety.

What qualifies you to attempt
to understand my mind?

My mother is a highly regarded
psychiatrist...

and I've been in therapy
ever since...

she accused me
of breast feeding co-dependently.

And Raj says he can teach you...
What did you call it?

I don't know,
some Indian meditation crap.

I see. I assume since the rest of you
have set the bar so low...

you're saving the most impressive
contribution for last.

Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.

My power is the ability to pretend
like I give a damn...

about your piddly-ass problems.

And that's 24/7, buddy.

And I appreciate the pretense.

So, what do you say, Sheldon?
Are we your X-Men?

No. The X-Men were named
for the X in Charles Xavier.

Since I am Sheldon Cooper,
you will be my C-Men.

Oh, that's not a good name.

Okay, Sheldon...

I'm going to be leading you through
a series of meditation exercises.

These methods come
from the ancient gurus of India...

and have helped me
overcome my own fears.

And yet you can't speak to women.

But thanks to meditation...

I'm able to stay in the same room
with them without urinating.

Now, ahem, close your eyes.

Okay, but don't punch me.

 What?
 When I was little my sister would say:

"Close your eyes,
you'll get a surprise."

And then she'd punch me.

 I'm not going to punch you.
 That's what my sister used to say.

 Look, do you wanna do this or not?
 I'm sorry. Proceed.

All right, ahem...

imagine yourself in the one place
you feel most at home.

 Where is that?
 SimCity.

More specifically, the SimCity
I designed, Sheldonopolis.

Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.

Where exactly? Sheldon Square?

Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium,
home of the fighting Sheldons?

Whatever you like.

I thought this was supposed to be
guided meditation.

Fine, you're in Sheldon Square.

Really? This time of the year?
It's a bit nippy.

Then put on a sweater.

Suppose I could run downtown
and pick up something at Shel-Mart.

Yeah. Whatever.
Just go buy a sweater.

The nice thing about Shel-Mart is
I own it, so I get a 15 percent discount.

You own the damn thing,
just take a freaking sweater.

I didn't turn a profit last quarter...

by taking product off the shelves
willy-nilly.

All right.

You've paid for a sweater
and you're in Sheldon Square.

Ahem. Hang on.

It's a cardigan, I have to button it.

 Oh, no.
 What now?

A Godzilla-like monster
is approaching the city.

I have to get my people to safety.

People of Sheldonopolis,
this is your mayor.

Follow me.

If the children can't run,
leave them behind.

Oh, the simulated horror.

Raj?

Just as I suspected.

Meditation is nothing but hokum.

I question your premise.

How is a new suit going to prevent me
from passing out...

in front of a ballroom
full of people?

It'll give you confidence.

Sometimes when I'm feeling
stressed out...

I go out and buy a cute top
or a fun skirt...

and I have a whole new outlook
on life.

Don't you eventually realize
you're the same stressed-out person...

in a cute top or a fun skirt?

Yeah, that's when I buy shoes.

Now, let's see what we got.

Oh. This is nice.

It's only one color.

Yes, so?

That's a lot of money
for only one color.

Fine. Why don't you pick out
what you like?

Hmm.

This is pretty sharp.

No. You're wrong.

This is great.

I had a suit like this when I was six.

Okay, I think we have a winner.

 Where the hell did you find that?
 In the prom department.

It's ridiculous.

Says the former member
of the corn queen's court.

 Please just try this one on?
 Okay.

But anything I put on now
is only gonna suffer in comparison.

This is absurd. I look like a clown.

So, Sheldon...

how you doing?

That's how you start
a psychotherapy session?

How am I doing?

I was promised a riverboat journey
into the jungles of my subconscious.

Instead I get the same question...

I hear from the lady
who slices my bologna at Ralph's.

I'm sorry. I'll start again.

Would it be helpful to you
if I told you about my dreams?

Um... I don't know, maybe.

I recently had a dream
that I was a giant.

But everything around me
was to scale so it all looked normal.

Well, how did you know you were
a giant if everything was to scale?

I was wearing size a million pants.

 Why don't we just talk?
 Ah. The talking cure.

Classical Freudian. Good choice.

If it will help speed things along...

my answers to the standard
Rorschach inkblot test are:

A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat...

and D, my father killing my mother
with a hypodermic needle.

Why don't I just start?

Sometimes people have trouble
accepting accolades...

if on a subconscious level,
they don't feel they deserve them.

Do you think maybe
that's what's happening here?

Really, Leonard?

You just going to try to recycle Adler's
doctrine of the inferiority complex?

I could probably get that
from the woman at Ralph's.

And she'd let me taste some pieces
of cheese for free.

But it could be part of your problem.
Let me give you an example.

When I was 8, I won a ribbon
at the science fair for my project...

Do Lima Beans Grow Better
to Classical Music.

But my mother pointed out
that it was just a rehash...

of my brother's earlier...

Do Lima Beans Grow Worse
to Rock 'n ' Roll.

I felt so guilty
I gave the ribbon back.

And how did that make you feel?

Terrible.

I worked really hard on that project.

I stayed up all night singing
the clown's aria from Pagliacci...

to a lima bean sprout.

Go on.

It wasn't my fault.

I had never seen
my brother's project.

And my mother could've told me
before...

instead of at the ceremony
in front of everyone.

So I hear you saying you're angry
with your mother.

Damn right,
I'm angry with my mother.

For God's sake,
I was 8 years old.

She humiliated me.

That's when the bed-wetting
started again.

 Thank you, Leonard.
 For what?

If someone as damaged as you
can find his way...

to crawl out of bed each morning...

I think I can face
a simple awards ceremony.

Wait, that's it?
I thought we had a whole hour.

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

It is my great honor
to introduce the winner...

of this year's Chancellor's Award
for Science, and my good friend...

Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

But before I do,
I'd like to share with you a letter...

from Sheldon's mother,
who couldn't be here tonight.

Isn't that nice?
His mother sent him a letter.

She's proud of him.

Wonder what that feels like.

"Dear Shelly."

That's what she calls him.
Shelly. It's a pet name.

You know what my mother's
pet name for me is? Leonard.

But I digress.

 "Dear Shelly, I am so proud..."
 Oh, dear.

 What's the matter?
 I'm getting dizzy.

Don't worry.
You're surrounded by your C-Men.

I can't do this. I'm going to faint.

All right, drink this. It'll relax you.

 Alcohol? I don't drink alcohol.
 Fine, faint.

I don't feel different.
This alcohol's defective.

Here. See if this one works.

First of all,
the projects were totally different.

I was showing that classical music
nurtures lima beans...

and makes them grow.
But my mother didn't hear me.

If you look at the relationship
between nurturing and growth...

I'd like to point out that my brother
is 8 inches taller than me.

I'm ready!

Right.

Ladies and gentlemen,
our guest of honor...

Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Thanks, shorty. I'll take it from here.

All right,
you people ready to have some fun?

You have an understanding
of differential calculus...

and at least one year
of algebraic topology?

Well, here come the jokes.

Why did the chicken
cross the Mobius strip?

To get to the same side?
Buzzinga.

A neutron walks into a bar and asks,
"How much for a drink?"

The bartender says,
"For you, no charge."

Hello? I know you're out there.

I can hear you metabolizing oxygen
and expelling carbon dioxide.

It looks like we have some
academic dignitaries in the audience.

Dr. Randall
from the geology department...

only man who's happy
when they take his work for granite.

Bada-cha.

I kid the geologists, of course...

but it's only because
I have no respect for the field.

Let's get serious for a moment.

Why are we all here?

Because we're scientists.

And what do scientists study?

The universe.

And what's the universe made of?

I am so glad you asked.

There's antimony, arsenic
Aluminum, selenium

Hydrogen and oxygen
And nitrogen and rhenium

And nickel, neodymium
Neptunium, germanium

Everybody!

And Iron, americium
Ruthenium, uranium

Europium, zirconium
Lutetium, vanadium

Just the Asians!

And lanthanum and osmium
And astatine and radium

Penny, Leonard.

Would you be able to answer
some questions I'm having...

about the events of last night?

 Sure.
 Question one.

Where are my pants?

You might wanna check YouTube.

 What do I search?
 It's already loaded. Just hit play.

All right, people,
let's get down to the math.

It Is only three-dimensional thinking
that limits our imagination.

Can I take my pants off
over my head?

Of course not,
my body's In the way.

But If we had access
to higher dimensions...

we could move our pants
around our bodies...

through the fourth dimension...

and our days of dropping trousers
would be over.

Oh, Lord, this couldn't be
any more humiliating.

Oh. Give it a minute.

Now for the astronomers
In the audience...

get ready to see the dark side
of the moon.

And here's Uranus.



All right, that's the last servo.

Behold the Mobile
Omnidirectional Neutralization

and Termination Eradicator.

Or...

MONTE.

Featuring one articulated
razor-sharp killing saw,

one polycarbonate grinding
and flipping wheel,

steel-armor plate exoskeleton
top and bottom,

and enough horsepower to drive
a 110 pounds of mechanized death

from zero to holy crap
in 4.8 seconds.

Is it wrong to say
I love our killer robot?

As with my father,
I both love and fear it.

All right, enough chitchat.
Let's destroy something.

One, two, three.

What shall be first to taste
the wrath of MONTE?

Maybe we should start small.

Perhaps today is the day

we finally find out
what's inside the Magic Eight Ball.

Did it when I was four.

It's an icosahedral die
floating in tinted blue water.

Man, call "spoiler alert"
before you say things like that.

How about the toaster oven?

What did the toaster oven
ever do to you?

What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins
in the third grade?

He still punched me in the face
with my own fists.

Sorry, little nerd,

you were just in the wrong boys' room
at the wrong time.

Gentlemen, goggles.

This is an auspicious moment.

Like Robert Oppenheimer
or Neil Armstrong,

we need the appropriate words
to mark this historic scientific event.

How about "Die, toaster, die"?

That'll do it.

All right, what's next?

No, I think I'm just going
to stay in tonight and do laundry.

Subtitles: sub-way.fr

This door got the full MONTE.

What the hell?

Killer robot.
We built it.

Yeah, well, it almost killed me.

If it wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead.

So, who exactly
does it want to kill?

I'm sorry, are you
unaware of the upcoming

Southern California
Robot Fighting League

Round Robin Invitational?

You know, since I moved last year,
not all my mail has been forwarded.

It's a big deal.

There's an awards banquet
and a dance afterward.

Perhaps you'd like to come with me.

I know the other fellas would be
really excited to see a girl there.

How is it supposed to be a dance
if I'm the only girl?

Well, that may be
a slight exaggeration.

You'd be the only doable girl.

You are a pig, Howard.

How is "doable" anything
but a compliment?

 Why don't we just work on the robot?
 Please, not now.

Once again, Penny and I
have begun our little tango.

Our tango?

The carnal repartee,
the erotic to and fro.

But as delicious
as the appetizer might be,

at some point
we will have to succumb

and eat the entr�e
while it's still...

 hot.

I'm begging you, stop talking.

Look, normally
I can just ignore you.

I get it... you're a little peculiar.
Like Sheldon.

Excuse me, Penny, but in this room,
you're the one who's peculiar.

You might be right.

But back to you.
I know you think you're some sort

of smooth-talking ladies' man,
but the truth is,

you are just pathetic and creepy.

So what are you saying?

I am saying it is not a compliment
to call me "doable."

It's not sexy to stare
at my ass and say,

"It must be jelly 'cause
jam don't shake like that."

And most important,
we are not dancing a tango,

we're not to'ing and fro'ing.

Nothing is ever going
to happen between us. Ever.

Wait a minute.

This isn't flirting.
You're serious.

Flirting?
You think I'm flirting with you?

I am not flirting with you.
No woman is ever gonna flirt with you.

You're just gonna
grow old and die alone.

Thanks for the heads up.

Where you going?

I'm going home to live
my creepy, pathetic life.

Someone had to say it.

What?

He said maybe we should enter you
in the killer robot competition.

Howard, the phone is ringing!

Here's a crazy idea, Ma: Answer it!

All right, hold on.

It's your friend, Leonard!

He wants to know why
you're not at school today!

I don't go to school, Ma.

I work at a university.

That's a school!
Now pick up the phone!

I don't want to talk to anybody.

Should I ask Leonard to bring
over your homework?!

I don't have homework.

I'm a grown man with a master's
degree in engineering!

Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants.

Want me to get you a Popsicle?

Cherry, please!

I ate the cherry.
All that's left is green.

You make me want to kill myself.

 What's going on?
 I don't know,

now they're just yelling
about Popsicles.

 Sounds like Penny really got to him.
 I'm not surprised.

Despite his hard and crusty shell,
Howard is a very sensitive man.

Do you know he writes poetry?

Mostly about men from Nantucket
and hermits named Dave,

but he does it
with real sensitivity.

Hey, Hofstadter.

Word around the pwasma wab
is you built a wobot?

 Yes, we did, Kripke.
 His name is MONTE.

Well, if you have any dewusions
about entering him

against my wobot,
the Kwipke Kwippler

in the Southern California
Robot Fighting League

Wound Wobin Invitational,
aka the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.,

his name is gonna be Scwap Metal.

Come on, is that really necessary?

Leonard, I believe it is.

This is trash talk,

and trash talk is a traditional
component in all sporting events.

Kripke,

your robot is inferior

and it will be defeated by ours

because ours exceeds yours
in both design and execution.

Also, I'm given to understand
that your mother is overweight.

Oh, snap.

Of course, if that is the result
of a glandular condition

and not sloth and gluttony,
I withdraw that comment.

What difference does it make?
Fat is fat.

There are boundaries.

Tell you what,
forget the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.

Wet's settle this woboto a woboto.

What do you mean?

There's no guarantee
we're gonna go against each other

in the Wound Wobin,
so let's throw down.

You know,

unless you're afwaid.

We accept your challenge.
Name a time and place.

 Tomorrow, 3:00, the kinetics wab.
 Make it so.

No, don't make it so.

Barry, we can't fight you tomorrow.
Our engineer is incapacitated.

What's wrong with him?

He's depressed because he's pathetic
and creepy and can't get girls.

We're all pathetic and cweepy
and can't get girls.

That's why we fight wobots.

If you're not there,
you'll be exposed to widicule.

I'm curious, what part of America
is that accent from?

 You got a minute?
 Yeah, come on in.

What's up?

 I need you to apologize to How...
 Get out.

Come on. He won't come out of his house
and we need him for a robot battle.

Well, then have the robot
go and get him.

The robot didn't hurt his feelings.

His feelings needed to be hurt.

He's been in bed for two days.

Probably with a blow-up doll.

He's not with a...

Does it really matter
who or what he's with?

The guy is devastated.

Please, how could I possibly
devastate Howard?

Okay, don't take this as a criticism,
but you kind of have

that overexposed-to-gamma-rays
thing going on.

What does that mean?

You know, like, most of the time,
you're the easygoing Bruce Banner,

but then, when you get angry,
you kind of turn into, like, you know?

I turn into a bear?

Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner?
You didn't get The Incredible Hulk?

Never mind.
Just, please go talk to him.

And say what?

That I didn't mean it,
because I meant it.

Maybe you can go at it
from a different angle,

like, you see a
glimmer of goodness in him

and you only said what you said
because you want to

nurture it and make it shine.

Okay, let's try it this way.

Remember the day
we met and you asked me

to go to your boyfriend's
apartment to get your TV back

and he was nine feet tall and he took
my pants off and you said...

What was that?
What did you say?

Oh, yes.
You said you owed me one.

Okay, come on, that's not fair.

I came home with no pants.

Fine, I'll go over there tomorrow.

Thank you.

I should probably give you
a heads up about his mother.

What about her?

She's a delightful woman.
You'll love her.

Howard, there's a blonde girl,
Patsy, here to see you!

Who?

Okay, now she's saying it's Penny.

I don't wanna talk to her.

Ma!

She ran past me.

Was I supposed to tackle her?

So, I just came by
to see how you were doing.

I'm fine.

Good.

Your mom seems nice.

People move away from her
on the bus.

What do you want?

I just want to apologize.

For some things that I have said.

About you.

I've been informed
that you have feelings.

And apparently, I have hurt them.

So, I'm sorry.

Fine. You're sorry.
Good-bye.

So... you're okay?

Hey, I'm a big boy.

I'm not traumatized
by some random comment

from some random woman.

I mean, get over yourself.

Bye.

So close.

Oh, my God.
That's Kripke's robot?

As you can see, the Kwippler is weducing
the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.

I can't watch anymore.

Sheldon, we have to call it off.

We don't have that option.

We've accepted the challenge.
We can't run away from a fight.

Please, we've spent our whole lives
running away from fights.

Personally, I can squeeze
through a hole in a fence half my size.

Impressive as that may be,
MONTE is not us.

MONTE has no fear.

Didn't we watch the same video?

Kripke's robot just had angry sex
with a mid-sized automobile.

You are overlooking the fact
we know what we're up against

and we can modify MONTE
so that he's prepared.

You wanna prepare him?

Install a bladder and a pair of shorts
so he can wet himself.

Excuse me, but how are we gonna make
any modifications without Wolowitz?

 Have you heard from Penny?
 Not yet.

Have faith, gentlemen.
We don't need Wolowitz.

Engineering is merely
the slow younger brother of physics.

Watch and learn.

Do either of you know
how to open the toolbox?

And then, when I was 14,

I met Marcy Grossman.

She was so beautiful.

She just got her braces off

but they left a little
of the overbite.

It was so hot.

Like a sexy little chipmunk.

I didn't have the courage

to ask her out,

but I dedicated a song to her

at the ninth grade talent show.

That sounds sweet.

Marcy Grossman is sunshine

On a cloudy day

When it's cold outside

Marcy Grossman is the month of May

It's cute.

I guess

You'd say

What can make me feel this way

Marcy Grossman,
Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman

Talkin' 'bout Marcy

That's great.

 Grossman.

It's fun.

And then she came up
with that sexy little chipmunk mouth

and spit in my hair.

Which brings us to tenth grade.

Do you think maybe sometimes

you try too hard?

Look at me.

What chance do I have
if I don't try too hard?

You'd have a terrific chance.

I mean, you're smart, you're funny.
You have a cool job.

You build stuff
that goes into outer space.

I guess.

I'm telling you,
I've known you for a year and a half

and this is the first time
I feel like I'm talking

to a real person.

And you know what? I like him.

He's a nice guy.

You really think so?

I don't know.

I do.

Nice little bot you've got here.

I'm aware.

What's this do, spin?

Yep. At 3400 RPM.

It can cut through steel
like it was wubber.

Neat.

Good work.

Sheldon, we've gotta call this off.

No, Leonard.

For years,
merciless thugs like Kripke

have made my life
a series of painful noogies

and humiliating wedgies

and the insensitively named
Indian burns.

That stops now.

But we don't have a chance.

The only improvement
you were able to make

was to put fresh batteries
in the remote.

What you fail to realize is
Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw:

overconfidence
from his robot's massive size

and its overwhelming power.

That's not overconfidence.
That's observation.

Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey
to my psychological warfare.

Observe.

I would ask if your robot
is prepared to meet its maker,

but as you are its maker,
clearly the two of you have met.

What is his pwoblem?

Way to bust out
the Jedi mind tricks, dude.

I just wanna make sure
we're all clear.

Standard robotic fighting
league rules apply.

Are you cwazy?

This is a stweet fight.
The stweet has no rules.

He's right, Leonard.
The paradigm is to the death.

I will, however,

give you the opportunity
to concede my superiority now

and offer me your robot
as the spoils of war.

Never.

I'd rather see MONTE dead
than in your hands.

That could be easily arranged.

Ready, set, go?

 Do it.
 All right then.

Weady. Set. Go.

 Come on, Sheldon, you got this.
 Indeed.

We are prepared for anything
he can throw at us.

That's new.

Run, MONTE, run!

Run, MONTE!

Go, go, go, go!

Don't hurt us, don't hurt us,
don't hurt us!

Well, so much for making up

for the emotional wounds
of childhood.

I did this.

MONTE was killed
by my hubris and my pride.

No matter what anybody says,
this is my fault.

No one's arguing with you, dude.

I got your text. How bad is...

Forget the robot.
What happened to you?

 He slipped and fell.
 Yes,

I slipped and fell.

In the bathroom.

Bounced right off the tub.

Now he knows what bathtubs
are capable of doing

when you don't treat them
with respect.

They sucker punch you
when your eyes are closed.

So what do you think, Howard?

It's not that bad, right?

A little electrical tape,
some solder...

Are you insane?

I've seen space probes
that crashed into the desert

that were in better shape than this.

You're right.

MONTE's gone.

We'll bury him in the morning.
A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

Leonard, you'll play your cello.

Honey, aren't you getting
a little carried away?

I mean, it's just a toy robot.

"Just a toy robot"?

I know, I got it.

Sheldon, I'm sorry.

Don't get the wrong idea.

The way I see it,
I'm halfway to pity sex.



All right, I'm ready
for my next question.

In a world where rhinoceroses
are domesticated pets,

who wins the Second World War?

Uganda.

Defend.

Kenya rises to power

on the export of rhinoceroses.

A Central African
power block is formed,

colonizing North Africa and Europe.

When war breaks out, no one can
afford the luxury of a rhino.

Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.

Correct.

My turn.

In a world where a piano is a weapon,
not a musical instrument,

on what does Scott Joplin
play "The Maple Leaf Rag"?

Tuned bayonets.

Defend.

Isn't it obvious?

You're right. My apologies.

What the hell are you guys playing?

It's a game we invented.

It's called Counterfactuals.

We postulate an alternate
world that differs from ours

in one key aspect and then
pose questions to each other.

It's fun for ages eight to 80.

Join us.

All right.

I like a good brainteaser.

Give it a whirl.

You're in luck;
this is an easy one.

In a world where mankind is ruled

by a giant intelligent beaver,

what food is no longer consumed?

Uh... a BLT where the
"B" stands for beaver?

I don't know.

Leonard, be serious.

We're playing a game here.

(clears throat)

I can figure this out.

Let's see.

Um, well, beavers eat tree bark.

The only tree bark I know that
humans consume is cinnamon.

So, I'll say cinnamon.

Incorrect.

Obviously, the answer
is cheese Danish.

What?

In a world ruled by a giant beaver,

mankind builds many dams to
please the beaver overlord.

The low-lying city of
Copenhagen is flooded.

Thousands die.

Devastated, the Danes never
invent their namesake pastry.

How does one miss that?

This is ridiculous.

You're just making stuff up.

Is he always like
this when he loses?

Oh, yes.

You should've been here for the
great Jenga tantrum of 2008.

You bumped the table
and you know it.

Perhaps it would be
kinder to play a game

more suited to his abilities.

We'll close our eyes and
count to ten while you hide.

I'm going to my room.

Very good, Leonard.

But next time, don't tell
us where you're hiding.

 


Did you guys see the paper

in The American Physics
Journal on supersolids?

It's pretty interesting.

This guy's working from
a hypothesis where...

Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.

What? Don't ruin it for me, man.

I printed out a PDF
to read on the potty.

On the potty?

What are you, five?

It's a potty. What do you call it?

Toilet.

That's a little vulgar for

the dinner table, don't you think?

Oh, and "potty" is okay?

"Potty" is innocent.

"Potty" is adorable.

What do you do in the potty,
wee-wee?

If I don't have to boom-boom.

Greetings.

You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.

Nice to see you. Hello.

Sorry we're late.

I must take responsibility.

I had to stop for
feminine hygiene supplies.

Aha. Okay.

I believe she's
experiencing her menses.

Actually, I'm not.

In order to avoid surprises,
I wear them all the time.

Aha. Okay.

"Toilet's" sounding
pretty good now, huh?

Hey, look, it's Shamy.

Shamy?

A juvenile amalgamation
of our names.

Sheldon, Amy-- Shamy.

Oh.

I don't like that.

Don't do that.

(awkward chuckle)

All righty. What's new?

Well, just recently, I learned
that you refer to us as Shamy,

and I don't like that.

I got it.

But what I was going for was,
you know, how's your life?

Like everybody else's.

Subject to entropy,
decay and eventual death.

Thank you for asking.

Why is she not taking our order?

I should've warned you,

one has to navigate a
labyrinth of social nonsense

before one can be fed here.

AMY: Really?

I assumed an establishment called

the Cheesecake Factory would
function more efficiently.

It's how they lure you in.

I believe it's called "
bait and switch."

Okay, I'm just gonna walk away,

'cause... I don't want to be here.

So, this is nice.

First time we've all
gotten together to eat.

You're right, he's a
festival of humdrum chitchat.

Okay, that's all I got.

Howard, you're up.

Um... tell us about your work, Amy.

I doubt you'd understand.

Sheldon tells me you only
have a master's degree.

Raj, do you have any
questions for Amy?

I'm curious as to why
we're not eating alone.

They can't function without me.

I'm the social glue that holds
this little group together.

You're welcome.

Listen, can I talk to you
about your girlfriend?

She's not my girlfriend.

She's a girl and she's my friend,

but there's no touching or
unsanitary exchange of saliva.

Got it.

Although, for the record,
on one occasion,

she licked her thumb to
remove raspberry jelly

from the corner of my mouth.

It's an action we both
regret to this day.

Uh-huh.

Anyway, I'm not sure
she's the best fit

for our little-- how should
we call it-- rebel alliance.

Oh, I never identified
with the rebel alliance.

Despite their tendency
to build Death Stars,

I've always been more
of an empire man.

Yeah, not my point.

I know what your point is.

You're intimidated
by Amy's intellect.

To that I say, buck up.

Okay, let me just

get right to it.

Amy is judgmental,
sanctimonious and frankly...

just obnoxious.

So?

So we already have
you for all that.

Are you suggesting I terminate
my relationship with Amy?

No, no, of course not.

Just have your relationship
someplace else.

May I point out that
for eight long months,

I suffered in silence
as your female companion

filled our apartment with her

off-key country music caterwauling,

the unappetizing spectacle

of her grinding a pumice stone
against her calloused feet

in our living room,

and night after night of
uninformative TV documentaries

about the Jersey Shore.

Suffered in silence?

Yes.

And I'd thank you to do the same.

Reall-- Silence?!

(sighs): Ah.

Nothing makes beer
taste better than

cool clear Rocky
Mountain spring water.

Where are the Rocky
Mountains, anyway?

Philadelphia.

Really?

I thought they were
out West someplace.

Think about it, Raj.

Where did the movie
Rocky take place?

Philadelphia.

Okay, now I get it.

So this is the plan?

From now on, we're just
gonna hide out in here

to avoid the Shamy?

I'm very comfortable here.

Penny, dear, why don't you shoot
another silver bullet my way?

Get one yourself.

Ooh, somebody's been
taking bitchy pills.

God, he's an ass when he drinks.

Oh, he's an ass when he doesn't.

You just don't hear it.

Think we need to start
entertaining the possibility

that the Shamy could
go on for years.

Well, if that's the case,
Penny will have to get satellite TV

and maybe once a week run a
vacuum through this place.

I thought you were going
to talk to Sheldon.

I did. Well, what'd he say?

Well, he pointed out that
he kinda sorta had to...

put up with you.

Kinda sorta had to?

I didn't agree with him.

Well, you defended me, right?

I tried, but...

he made a fairly
well-reasoned argument.

You're not doing that right.

What?

Gimme.

No. Trust me.

No! I do this for
my mom all the time.

See?

With the grain.

Wow, that is better.

And someday, when you
have varicose veins,

I'll show you how to massage them.

Oh, God, never again.

I assume by "never again,
" you mean never again will you drink

all of Penny's beer,
then run down to the gas station

for a couple of 40s,
a box of Slim Jims

and the latest issue of
Bombay Badonkadonks.

I was homesick.

The highlight of the evening
was when you showed us

your Bollywood break
dancing skills.

(humming Indian music)

That's very offensive.

Yeah, we all thought so.

LEONARD: Oh, no.

What?

It's John and Yoko.

More like Yoko and Yoko.

Greetings. Hey.

I brought Amy here

to show her some of
the work I'm doing.

It's very impressive,
for theoretical work.

Do I detect a hint
of condescension?

I'm sorry, was I being too subtle?

I meant compared to the
real-world applications

of neurobiology,
theoretical physics is--

what's the word I'm looking for?--
hmm, cute.

(Leonard and Wolowitz oohing)

Are you suggesting the
work of a neurobiologist

like Babinski could ever
rise to the significance

of a physicist like
Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?

I'm stating it outright.

Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast

and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.

You take that back.

Absolutely not.

My colleagues and I are mapping

the neurological
substrates that subserve

global information processing,

which is required for
all cognitive reasoning,

including scientific inquiry,
making my research ipso facto

prior in the ordo cognoscendi.

That means it's better
than his research,

and by extension, of course, yours.

I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying

to work on the defecating
Clark Maxwell, so...

Excuse me, but a
grand unified theory,

insofar as it explains everything,

will ipso facto
explain neurobiology.

Yes, but if I'm successful,

I will be able to map and
reproduce your thought processes

in deriving a grand unified theory,

and therefore, subsume your
conclusions under my paradigm.

That's the rankest psychologism,

and was conclusively
revealed as hogwash

by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!

We appear to have
reached an impasse.

I agree.

I move our relationship
terminate immediately.

Seconded.

There being no objections...

ALL: Uh-uh.

the motion carries.

Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.

Good day, Sheldon Cooper.

Women, huh?

Can't live with them,

can't successfully
refute their hypotheses.

Amen to that.

Hey, Sheldon.

Hello.

I hear you broke up with Amy.

A breakup would imply
she was my girlfriend.

She was a girl who was my friend

who is now a girl who
is not my friend.

Wow. That's like the
worst country song ever.

So, how are you doing?

Regarding what?

Amy.

I don't follow.

Well, breakups-- or whatever the
hell this is-- can be tough.

Penny, I assure you, I'm fine.

My relationship with Amy
was purely intellectual,

There were no emotional bonds,

the severing of which would
cause me any discomfort.

The relationship simply
outlived its utility,

and I'm continuing on
with my life as before.

Okay. Good.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to buy a pussycat.

I gotta tell you guys,

I'm a little worried about Sheldon.

We're all a little
worried about Sheldon.

No, I mean since the
Shamy hit a reef.

Oh, I thought you were just
making a generalization:

"You know,
I'm worried about Sheldon

"someday setting off a
low-yield nuclear device

because the cafeteria
ran out of lime Jell-O."

What does "hit a reef" mean?

Uh, went splitsville.

Pardon?

Turned to boom-boom.

Ah.

I think Sheldon really misses Amy.

You should lend him your copy of
Bombay Badonkadonks.

He got a cat to keep him company.

You're kidding.

He takes it everywhere:

to bed, to the bathroom.

He takes the kitty to the potty?

I thought we discussed the P-word.

Don't try to change me, dude.

I am what I am.

Oh, gentlemen.

Hey. Aren't you going
to introduce us

to your little friend?

My apologies.

Raj, Howard, I'd like you to meet Dr.
Robert Oppenheimer.

Hello. Hi.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

the father of the atomic
bomb wants a saucer of milk.

Okay, I get it.
We're worried about Sheldon.

Yeah.

Hey.

Oh, no.

Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.

So you decided to get the
whole Manhattan Project?

but he's so zazzy.

Okay, we need to talk.

About what?

Cats, Sheldon.

You're clearly upset
about Amy being gone,

and you're trying to replace
her with a bunch of cats.

Clowder. What?

A group of cats is a clowder.
Or a glaring.

Okay, yeah, fine.

It's the kind of thing you ought

to know now that we have one.

Terrific. My point is,
you need to face up

to what you're feeling
with this breakup.

It wasn't a breakup.

A breakup would imply that
Amy was my girlfriend.

Okay, I got it, I got it;
she's not your girlfriend.

Now listen to me.

I know about loneliness.

I know about trying to replace
someone with other stuff.

When I broke up with Penny,
I got back into my cello,

I built a bunch of model rockets,

I got those weightlifting gloves
and that five-pound dumbbell.

You didn't break up,
she dumped you.

She didn't dump me.

It was mutual!

I was there. She dumped you.

Okay, fine.

Live with cats.

Be like my Aunt Nancy.

She had dozens of them.

And do you know what happened
after she died? They ate her.

You don't have to sell
me on cats, Leonard.

I'm already a fan.

All right, fellas,
who's in the mood for Fancy Feast?

Well, that's not fancy at all.

Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.

Where is he?

He's in his bedroom.

Now, when you said on the phone

he broke up with a girl,
you meant an actual girl,

not something you kids
whipped up in a lab?

No, she's real.

Did they sin?

No, no, it's not like that.

It's, uh...

I don't know what it's like.

But there is something I
should prepare you for.

Oh, relax, Leonard,
I have raised that boy.

I've seen him at his best,
I've seen him at his worst.

There's nothing he can
do that'll surprise me.

Hold on to that thought.

(knocks)

Come in.

(cats meowing)

Surprise.

Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.

My, my, that's a powerful smell.

I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer,
Frisch, Panofsky,

Feynman, Weisskopf...

Yeah, I get it.

You got a lot of cats

and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.

What are you doing here?

Leonard called.

And he said that you were
pining for a young lady.

Oh, that's preposterous.

I'm not pining over anyone.

Oh, lambchop, we can
quibble what to call it,

but I think we can
both agree it's creepy.

I do not agree.

Cats make wonderful companions.

They don't argue or question
my intellectual authority,

and this little guy here,

I think you'll find
to be quite zazzy.

You should have called sooner.

Shelly! Dinner's ready!

SHELDON: Coming!

No cats!

Aw...

What is she doing here?

I called her.

Your mother thinks

you might be losing
your mind over me.

As a neurobiologist, I was curious.

Well, rest assured, I am in
full possession of my faculties.

(sneezes): 25 cats!

Oh, God bless you, dear.

Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.

All right, but you're
not fooling me.

Whenever you say we have to talk,

it means you want me to listen.

Then stop talking.

Yes, ma'am.

Now, the reason I
called Amy over was

to find out what type
of person she is.

And after chatting a bit,

I have to say that while she is a

perfectly unique young woman,

you two are definitely not
suited for each other.

That's a peculiar conclusion.

By any standard,
Amy is more similar to me

than anyone I've ever met.

Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly,
I can't see it.

Well, whether you see
it or not is irrelevant.

I can't see subatomic particles,

but nevertheless, they're there.

Excellent point.

A physics point.

Touché.

Well, putting aside the pig Latin,

it's a good thing that

you two decided to
end the relationship

so I didn't have to end it for you.

Amy, after consideration,

I believe we may have acted rashly.

I propose we resume
our relationship

and attempt to resolve
our differences.

I'll agree to that only
if you'll stipulate

that 80% of our difficulties
were caused by you.

I'll go as high as 40. Sixty-five.

Done.

You understand that moving forward,

we deal with the fact that my
mother does not approve of you?

I do. I find being cast

in the role of bad
girl oddly titillating.

Would you like to see my cats?

I would. I love cats.

They're the epitome
of indifference.

Ah, then you may find
Zazzles a little cloying.

I saw what you did there.

He thinks he's such a smarty pants.

He's no different from any man.

You tell 'em not to do
something, that's all

they want to do.

If I hadn't told my brother Stumpy

not to clear out the
wood chipper by hand,

we'd still be calling him Edward.

Now, don't you move.

I'll bring over all the food.

No, no, no, I can do it.

Well, isn't that sweet?


Thank you, Amy.

Here's your cat.

And here's your $20.

AMY: Next!

Thank you, Amy.

Here's your cat.

And here's your $20.





I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper...

and welcome to the premiere episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:

Fun with Flags.

Over the next 52 weeks...

you and I are going to explore
the dynamic world of vexillology.

Hang on, Dr. C. What's vexillology?

Vexillology is the study of flags.

Cool.

I think I just learned something.

 Did you have fun doing it?
 I'll say.

Fun and information
are two sides to this video podcast.

Not unlike the only two-sided state flag:
Oregon.

Oh, look.

Hello, Mr. Beaver.

In future episodes,
we'll answer some burning questions.

What's the only non-rectangular flag?

What animal appears most often on flags?

What animal appears second most often
on flags?

And more.

Sweet.

Why are you waving a white flag?

I'm surrendering to fun.


Now, today's episode of Fun with Flags
is not fun...

but it is important.

Flags, you gotta know how to hold them...

you gotta know how to fold them.

Let's start by identifying
the parts of our flag.

 This edge is the hoist and it's used to...
 Excuse me. Sorry, excuse me.

Cut.

Did you not see we are rolling?

I'm having dinner with Penny.
I have to get out of here.

And I have flag knowledge
that I have to get out of here.


 You okay?
 No, I'm a little rattled.

But like the flag over Fort Sumter,
I'm still here.

And take two.

Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper...

and welcome to the premiere episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:

Fun with Flags.

Over the next 52 weeks...

you and I are going to explore
the dynamic world of vexillology.

Hang on, Dr. Cooper.
What's vexillology?

Vexillology is...
Why is there a face on that flag?

It's Ferdinand T. Flag.

I thought he might help
bring in some younger viewers.

Confound it, you're right.
It's brilliant. Let's take it from the top.

That was a really nice dinner.

 I'm glad you asked me out again.
 Me too. I missed you.

You see me all the time.

You sure you just don't miss the sex?


Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great.
Have you ever tried it? Heh, heh.

I have. You are not wrong.

If we're gonna try dating again,
we should take things slow.

Oh, I can take it slow.

Did I tell you about my girlfriend
in high school, Karen Berberick?

To this day she doesn't know
we were going out.

Made it easier on her
when I broke things off.

Okay, well, maybe not that slow.

How about this:

Are you familiar with the typical
development for computer software?

You know, just for fun,
let's say I'm not.

Before an application is released,
they give it a trial run.

We could do that.

And if we hit a rough spot,
instead of getting mad, we say:

"Hey, we found a bug"
and report it, so it can be fixed.

You mean like a beta test?

Technically, this would be an alpha test.

A beta test requires people that
weren't involved in the develop...

Seriously? Do I not get credit
for knowing beta test?

No, you should. Absolutely.
That was me being pedantic.

And that's our first bug.

You reported it, I can fix that.
See? This is good.

All right. Let's give it a shot.

Great. You keep a list, I'll keep a list,
at some point, we'll exchange.

 Okay. Good night, Leonard.
 Night.

Attaboy, Hofstadter.

Nothing gets the ladies hotter
than software development analogies.

 Hey, I'm back.

Take 47.

Well, here's an interesting fact
about flags.

I will take that action.

"The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti
were identical by coincidence.

A fact that wasn't discovered
until they competed against each other...

at the 1936 Olympics."

And thankfully, their embarrassment
was overshadowed by rise of Fascism.

Let's see the new phone.

I stopped on the way to work.

Hey. Do you wanna
peel the plastic off with me?

Really? Me?

 That's, like, the best part.
 Grab a corner.

Whoa, what's your hurry, cowboy?

Savor the moment.

Oh, yeah.

Speaking of cowboys...

do you know what country
has not one, but two cows on its flag?

The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra.

Ooh! The next classic episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:

Fun With Flags is writing itself.

Oh, let me try the voice recognition.

Hey, I let you peel the plastic,
don't get greedy.

 Hello?


What's your name?

My name? It's Siri.

Look at that. There's finally a woman
in your life you can talk to.

Are you single?

I don't have a marital status,
if that's what you're asking.

Yeah, you're right, that's too personal.
We hardly know each other.

How about a cup of coffee?

I found six coffee shops.

Three of them are fairly close to you.

I will see you gentlemen later.

She is gonna break his heart.

For someone who has a machine
that can travel anywhere in time...

Doctor Who sure does have a thing
for modern-day London.

Careful. It's that kind of sass
that can get a person uninvited...

to this year's Who Con.

We're not counting this as a date,
are we?

I'm... I'm not sure,
but I think the right answer here is "no."

Bug report: When a guy asks me
to spend time with him...

he plans
something more interesting...

than hanging out at home,
watching TV.

Even Doctor Who?

 Even Doctor Who.

Who Con, you're out.

Okay, bug report taken.

Next time, I will have a better plan
for our evening's activity.

Well, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

Yeah. Oh, wait. Here. Almost forgot.

 Here.
 What's this?

My bug report to you.

Well, it's quite a list you got there.

It's color-coded.

Red means "fix right away."

Yellow is "whenever you get a chance."

And green is "I could probably learn
to live with it."

There's a key down here at the bottom.
It's neat, huh?

Yep.

So have a good night.

Yep.

Look at that.

Someday, we will tell future generations
that dating used to be hard.

What's baffling me is what you
could have possibly put on the list.

Hair too golden?

Laugh too musical?

World too much a better place
for her mere presence in it?

How about constantly talks
with food in her mouth?

Her heart's full of love,
no one cares what's in her mouth.

So, Siri...

what's happening? How are you?

I am well.

What are you doing right now?

What am I doing? I'm talking with you.

You have a beautiful voice.

Thank you. It's nice to be appreciated.

I bet it is.

Why don't women like me?

Let me check on that.

How about a web search
for "Why don't women like me?"

Well, no need. I've already done that.

Uh, Siri, do you have a last name?

My name is Siri.

Ah, one name.

Like Cher, Madonna, Adele.

All the women who rock me.

My name is Rajesh,
but you can call me Raj.

Would you like me to call you "Raj"?

I'd like you to call me "sexy."

From now on, I'll call you "sexy." Okay?

Okay.

Siri, I'm in the mood for gelato.

I found 10 restaurants
whose reviews mention gelato.

Seven of them are fairly close to you.

Thank you, darling.

You're most certainly welcome, sexy.

 Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.
 I'm sorry?

You've taken
a great evolutionary leap...

by abandoning human interaction
and allowing yourself...

to romantically bond
with a soulless machine.

Kudos.

I haven't bonded with it.

Oh, no, of course. I understand.

You're afraid the world isn't ready
for your taboo love.

Your secret's safe with me.
It's just a phone.

Cooper.

Kripke.

Heads up.

Professor Rothman urinated
in the particle physics lab again...

so we're gonna move up
his retirement party.

Friday, 5:00. Pot luck.

Thanks, Barry.

Siri, remind me Friday morning
to make my famous popovers.

All right, I'll remind you.

You got Siri, huh?

Voice recognition on that thing
is terrible. Look.

Siri, can you recommend a restaurant?

I'm sorry, Bawwy.

I don't understand
"wecommend a westauwant."

Listen to me.
Not restaurant. Restaurant.

I don't know what you mean
by "Not westauwant. Westauwant."

See? Total crap. You suck, Siri.

Hey, don't talk to her like that.
She's a lady.

Well, that "lady" took high-res pictures
of my junk last night for Craigslist.

Later.

It's open.

Hey, you ready to go?

Yeah, ju...
Hang on, let me just finish this chapter.

 Well, can you finish it later?
 No, I can't.

Reading books is a big part
of my life now because, you know:

"We'd have more fun things to talk about
if I read more."

Great. Good, great.
What are you reading?

Two Weeks to Rock-Hard Abs.

They kind of spoil the ending
right in the name of that, don't they?

All right. Look.
Just remember how this works.

We don't get mad about these things.

Speaking of which, I've addressed
your bug report on my date planning.

I've got a really fun evening for you.
It's kind of a surprise.

All right, terrific. Let me just go
find a pair of shoes that aren't so tall.

We wouldn't want you to feel like you
were "out for a walk with your mommy."

Thank you.

Oh, here's my list for you. Right there.


All right, fair enough.

I certainly can be quieter
when we kiss.

It was an expression of passion...

but if it's coming across
as "juicy and weird," who wants that?

It... It...

I'm sorry, can you be more specific
on how my eyebrows are "stupid"?

No, never mind. It's right here.

 Good timing. Dinner's almost ready.
 Great.

Oh, smells amazing in here.

 Yeah, what are we eating?
 An exotic little treat.

I was just talking to Siri
about Peking duck...

she said she knew
about four Chinese grocers...

two of which are fairly close to me.

Her spontaneity is contagious.

Who's Siri?
Is he dating somebody new?

Yes. His phone.

Is that cute or creepy?

Uh-huh.

Can I pour you some wine?
I think you'll enjoy it.

Traditional choice with Peking duck
is a sauvignon blanc...

but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling.

I wasn't sure...

but I didn't wanna have an argument
with her in the middle of Trader Joe's.

Now, what should we put Siri in
for dinner?

Leopard, sparkles?

Or to paraphrase Coco Chanel:

"You can never go wrong
with a little black case."

Siri, play some smooth jazz.

Playing smooth jazz.


Oh, my God, Kenny G.

This woman can read me like a book.

I can't believe I bought my soul mate
at Glendale Galleria.

I don't know if I wanna stay.

This is amazing.
How did you even get this idea?

I called your dad. I asked what things
you liked to do when you were a kid.

This seemed easier than getting a cow
out here so you could tip it.

Okay, you're kind of really great.

For a person whose neck massages...

feel like an eagle
is trying to carry you to its nest?

Bug report. I complimented you.
You should take it and shut up.

Right, sorry. Sorry.

 And stop apologizing all the time.
 Right. Sorry.

All right, let's shoot stuff.

Do you want me
to show you what to do?

I play a lot of "Grand Theft Auto."
I think I know how to handle a gat.

Wow, you are cute
when you get all gangsta.



So I've got a gunshot wound.

That's pretty badass.

No, you've got a Reebok
with a gunshot wound...

and an ouchie on your pinky toe.

Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid.

Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless
it is medically necessary. That is the law.


Well, thank you for a really cool evening.

Thank you for hiding my Star Wars
socks at the emergency room.

Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test
and see where we stand?

Things are looking good.

So are we still taking things slow?

Because a gunshot wound today...

last week I slammed my thumb.

We don't know how much time I have.

Good night, you.



First door on the left.

Thank you.


vacuum-cleaner repair shops in your area.

Four are fairly close to you.

Ahem.

Hello, sexy. What can I help you with?

If you'd like to make love to me
just tell me.


I'm sorry. I don't understand:


No!



Knight to queen's bishop-five.

Oh, very nice. What's
Leonard going to do?

Does he give up the pawn or
does he give up the position?

Let's find out. Leonard, ready?

Ready.

Go.

Damn it. I slipped.

Too bad. You know the rules of
Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess.

Leonard died again, Sheldon. You're up.

Despite my deep love of chess, lasers
and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.

Why?

 Because it's almost 11:00.
 So?

So, Penny has a "don't knock on my door before
11:00 or I punch you in the throat" rule.

Hey, you know what'd be a great idea?

We get some girls over here and
play Laser Optical Strip Chess.

Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing
to play that, you don't want to see naked.

You underestimate me.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

Hey, Sheldon.

 It's 11:00 a.m.
 I know. You're safe.

This package came
while you were at work.

Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.

 Excuse me.
 What?

 You have to sign this.
 What is it?

When I signed for the package, I was
deputized by the United Parcel Service

and entrusted with its final delivery.

I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package
so that I'm fully indemnified and no longer liable.

Sheldon, it's just a box of rhinestones.

Well, the contents are irrelevant.
A legal bailment has been created.

Does that mean nothing to you?

It means nothing to anybody.

Come here, let me show
you what I'm doing.

Bailment describes a
relationship in common law

where a physical possession of
personal property, or "chattels, "

is transferred from one person, the
bailor, to another person, the bailee...

ah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look!
I started a business.

Obviously, not a cleaning business.

No, I'm making flower barrettes. See?

I call them Penny Blossoms.

I made one for myself, then all
the girls at work wanted one.

Then I showed some to this lady
who runs a shop in Old Town.

She sells cards and homemade jewelry.
She said she wanted to sell them.

I said, "Okay." And in
one week, I made a $156.

Good for you. Sign here.

Sheldon, don't you get it?

If this takes off, I won't
have to be a waitress anymore.

But then who will bring me my
cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?

 Another waitress.
 What's her name?

I don't know.

And you're going to
let her handle my food?

Nancy. Her name is Nancy.

I think you're just making that up.

Sheldon, I'm sorry about
your hamburger, okay?

I just don't want to be a
waitress for the rest of my life.

Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.

Fine, cheeseburger.

Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.

So, what do you think? I mean, this
could be a business, right?

How many of these can you make a day?

About 20.

And how much profit do you
make per... Penny Blossom?

I don't know, like,50
cents. I'm not sure.

Of course you're not. All right...

Ten dollars a day times five days a
week times 52 weeks a year is $2,600.

 That's all?
 Before taxes.

I don't have to pay taxes on this stuff.

I believe the Internal Revenue
Service would strongly disagree.

But, if you took advantage of modn marketing
techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, 

you might be able to make
this a viable business.

And you know about that stuff?

Penny...

I'm a physicist.

I have a working knowledge of the entire
universe and everything it contains.

Who's Radiohead?

I have a working knowledge of the
important things in the universe. Good luck.

Sheldon, hold on.

Could you maybe show me how
to make more money with this?

 Of course I could.
 Sheldon, wait!

Will you?

Just to be clear here, you're
asking for my assistance.

Yes.

And you understand that will
involve me telling you what to do?

I understand.

And you're not allowed to be sarcastic
or snide to me while I'm doing so.

Okay.

Good.

Let's begin with the premise that everything
you've done up to this point is wrong.


Oh, imagine that.
 Sarcasm. Good-bye.
 No, sorry. Wait!

Please come back!


There. Done.

All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.

Pretty good, right?

That's 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour.

Based on your cost of materials
and your wholesale selling price, 

you'll effectively be paying
yourself... $5.19 a day.

A day?

There are children in a sneaker
factory in Indonesia who outearn you.

That just can't be right.

 You're questioning my math?
 No, sorry.

 Want me to show my work?
 Oh, God, no.

 Just please tell me what to do about it.
 All right.

Are you familiar with the development
that resulted from Honor� Blanc's

1778 use of interchangeable parts?

The assembly line, of course.

Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be
snide, you're not allowed to be condescending.

That wasn't a part of our original
agreement, and I don't agree to it now.

All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up
machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?

You're thinking of the moving assembly line, an
understandable but not excusable mistake.

No. The...

The moving assembly line, that was
introduced by Henry Ford in 1908.

That innovation is what made
possible our modern consumer culture

by enabling a low-unit
cost for manufactured goods.

I guess that isn't one of the
topics discussed on your Radiohead.

Let's go. We're going to
miss the coming attractions.

What's the matter?

I think I bruised a testicle
capturing that last pawn.

# Please pay attention and listen to me #

# Give me some time
to blow the man down #

# I'm a deepwater sailor
just come from Hong Kong #

# Give me way, hey, blow the man down #

# If you give me some
whiskey I'll sing you a song #

# Give me some time
to blow the man down #

Hello?

 Hello.
 Hello.

# Come quickly lay aft
To the break of the poop #

# To me way, hey, blow the man down #

# Or I'll help you along
with the toe of my boot #

# Give me some time
to blow the man down #

W-W-Wait, what's
going on?

I assume you're referring
to the sea shanty.

It's a rhythmic work song
designed to increase productivity.

Yeah, it's crazy, but it totally works.

Look, we made this Penny
Blossom in under three minutes.

Terrific, but that kind of raises
more questions than it answers.

Penny's making hair accessories.

I'm helping her optimize
her manufacturing process.

All right, break's over.

# Pay attention to orders
now you one and all... #

Hold on. What are you
using as a bonding agent?

 Hot glue.
 You're kidding.

Any of the cyanoacrylates
would do a better job.

It won't work, the flower's too porous.

What if we infused the bottom layer with
silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?

Intriguing.

Good question. What are you marketing
and distribution channels?

Well, there are the waitresses at my
work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town...

Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush--
virtually non-existent.

I'm thinking that we set her up with a
hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.

Why not eliminate the middle man?

We could install a small server farm
with a static IP in her bedroom.

She'd need some kind of
industrial cooling system.

Of course, but before we set up a
marketing and distribution infrastructure, 

we should finish optimizing
the manufacturing process.

To start with, she has a terrible problem
with moisture-induced glitter clump.

Yeah, it's a bitch.

Uh, I've seen this before.

Where?

It's a common stripper problem.

They dance, they sweat, they clump.

Are you thinking about adding a
desiccant like calcium sulfate?

Actually, I'm thinking about
this one stripper named Vega.

But sure, calcium sulfate could work.

Let's think out of the box for a moment.

How about a molecular sieve?

I've got a spaghetti
strainer in the kitchen.

Wow.

Hey, we could liberate some
micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.

Oh, great. Raj, why don't you
and Howard go get the charcoal?

Leonard, why don't you start working
on some preliminary Web site designs.

I'll make some space in our apartment
so we can move the manufacturing process.

Well, what's wrong with my apartment?

It's not my apartment.

Wait, wait, what am I going to do?

Uh, hey, it's your business.
Do whatever you want.

Okay, cool.

I'm going to take a nap.

I'm still tweaking things a little bit, but this
will give you the general idea of the Web site.

So, what do you guys think?

Uh, pretty much any way I say that
is going to hurt his feelings.

Okay, what's wrong with it?

 What's wrong with it?
 Not you. I wasn't asking you.

Penny?

Uh, well, it's a little juvenile.

I mean, it kind of looks like the
MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.

No, it doesn't.

Please. Dateline could use
it to attract predators.

Penny, this is your enterprise, so
it's ultimately your decision, 

but based on the quality of his work, I'd
strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.

You want to fire me?

What I want is irrelevant.
This is Penny's decision.

Penny?

Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job
then why do we already have orders?

 We do?
 Look.

Mrs. Fiona Fondell from
Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.

No kidding. Two?

Look at the comments.

"Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will
be perfect to cover my bald spot."

that... that is so sweet.

Camouflaging bald spots.

That's primarily a male concern.

Perhaps we could expand our market.

How are flower barrettes
going to appeal to men?

We add Bluetooth!

Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want
to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?

Penny, everything is
better with Bluetooth.

Holy crap. Someone just ordered
a thousand Penny Blossoms.

Get out!

Who needs a thousand sparkly
flower barrettes with rhinestones?

"The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New
Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau."

Oh, another market to expand
into-- balding gay men.

And I'll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.

We should get to work.

Wait, wait, why does
it say "one-day rush"?

Since when do we offer a one-day rush?

Amazon offers one-day rush.

Yeah, but they don't have
to glue the books together.

How the hell are we going to make a
thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?

Don't yell at me. I'm not
manufacturing. I'm just Web design.

Okay, well, I'm gonna have to
call them and cancel the order.

Excuse me, but was this not your goal?

Financial independence through
entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation?

My brilliance and
innovation, of course, but still.

I just don't see how
we can pull this off.

That, right there, that equivocation and
self-doubt, that is not the American spirit.

Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo?

Did Jim Bowie?

They didn't quit. They were massacred...

by like a gazillion angry Mexicans.

Let me put it this way.

Your gross receipts on this one order
will be over $3,000 for one night's work.

You guys get started.

 What are you doing?
 Going online to buy shoes!

She'll be coming round
the mountain when she comes

She'll be coming round
the mountain when she comes

She'll be coming round the mountain
She'll be coming round the mountain...

You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday
nights doing this, I could have stayed in India.

Oh, stop with the fake third world crap.

Your father's a gynecologist. And
you had a house full of servants.

We only had four servants.

And two of them were children.

How we doing?

We have 128 assorted Penny
Blossoms ready to ship.

Oh, God, we're never gonna finish in time.

Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?

I believe I'm hearing some
negativity on the factory floor.

So?

Penny, the labor force is a living
organism that must be carefully nurtured.

Any counterproductive grumbling must be
skillfully headed off by management. Observe.

Less talk, more work!

 Nicely done.
 Thank you.

You hear any union talk, you let me know.

# Someone's in the
kitchen with Dinah... #

# Someone's in the
kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow #

# Someone's in the
kitchen with Dinah... #

Sheldon? Sheldon!

'Cause I sold my soul
to the company store.

Honey, do you want some coffee?

I don't drink coffee.

Come on, but if you don't stay
awake we'll never finish in time.

I'm sorry, coffee's out of the question.

When I moved to California, I promised my
mother that I wouldn't start doing drugs.

Leonard, help.

Sheldon, we still have 380
of these things to make.

I have complete faith that
you will make them. Good night.

Leonard?

But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership
this entire enterprise will surely fail.

You're right, of course.

Here, this will help.

Very well, but if this leads
to opiates or hallucinogenics, 

you're going to have
to answer to my mother.

Look at Planck's Constant.
People say it's arbitrary.

It could not be less arbitrary.

If it varied slightly, life as
we know it would not exist. Bam!

Now, now, let's reconsider the entire argument, but
with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause.

So you are thinking of a universe
that's not expanding from the center--

no, it is retreating from
a, from a possibility space. Bam!

This is a space where we are all
essentially Alice through the looking glass, 

standing in front the Red Queen, and we're
being offered a cracker to quench our thirst.

Bam!

Of course, in another universe, let's
call it universe prime, 

there's another Sheldon, let's
call him Sheldon prime...

 We should have let him go to bed.
 Bam.

I can't believe we actually did it.

1,000 friggin' Penny Blossoms.

I just want you guys to know I
am really grateful for your help.

And for ever dollar I make, I'm
going to give you 20 cents.

That's your entire profit margin.

Then never mind.

I'll print out the shippi label.

What?

We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New
Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance.

They want another
thousand Penny Blossoms.

Really?

One-day rush.

I really need to take
that off the Web site.

Okay, well. Guess we'd better get started.

You can't be serious.

Come on. What about the living organism
of the workforce and the American spirit?

And Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?

Davy Crockett. Jiminy
Crockett was a cricket.

Yes, yes, I know that, okay?

I'm tired-- I've had
like 18 cups of coffee.

The point is, if we just
pull together, we can do this.

Who's with me?

Penny, although you may find it
hard to believe, we do have lives.

Leonard?

Sorry.

My apologies to the gay community
of East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Zoom, zoom, zoom!

Where's the coffee?

We're all out.

No problem.

I'll be back before this
banana hits the ground.

Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!

Yes!

Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser
Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.



All I'm saying is, if they
took all the money they spent

trying to make
a decent Hulk movie,

they could probably
just make an actual Hulk.

That is apt and amusing.

I think I shall share that

with Amy Farrah Fowler.

She'll appreciate
the witticism.

Thank you.

It'll also help improve her
initial impression of you.

So what's going on with you two?

Well, the status is
as it always was.

She's a girl. She's a friend.

She is not my--

please forgive me
for doing this--

"girlfriend."

Right, right.

So you're still just
texting and emailing?

You don't feel any need
to hang out with her, you know--

be in the same room?

Leonard, you are
my best friend.

I've known you
for seven years,

and I can barely tolerate
sitting on the couch with you.

Imagine my attitude regarding
prolonged physical proximity

to Amy Farrah Fowler.

Got it.

I sense judgment on your part.

No, no.

Maybe a little.

May I suggest that your
criticism is based on jealousy.

Jealousy? What do I
have to be jealous of?

I have a functioning
and satisfying relationship

with a female.

You have none.

Oh, right. That.

Jealousy is an ugly
green-eyed monster--

not unlike the Hulk--

who, by the way,
also has a girlfriend.

In this iteration,
Jennifer Connelly,

whom you may recall as
the girlfriend of Russell Crowe

in A Beautiful Mind,

a feel-good romp if
there ever was one.

I'm not jealous.

Leonard not jealous.

 


You know, it just
occurred to me,

if there are an infinite
number of parallel universes,

in one of them,
there's probably a Sheldon

who doesn't believe
parallel universes exist.

Probably. What's your point?

No point.

It's just one
of the things

that makes one of
the mes chuckle.

What makes you
chuckle, Leonard?

Hmm, recently?

Not much.

Is it because of the
conflict that arises

from your desperate need
to pair-bond with a woman,

and the apparent collective
decision of all womankind

to deny you
that opportunity?

Um...

Shut up.

You know,
when my grandfather died,

and Meemaw was alone,
my mom arranged for her

to visit a center
three times a week

where she could socialize
with other lonely people.

It's very nice.

They discuss current events,
play bridge, get a hot meal.

That sounds lovely.

It is if you
like bridge.

Do you like bridge,
Leonard?

Sheldon, I'm just not
dating someone right now.

I don't need to go
to a senior center.

Meemaw resisted at first,
but now she loves it.

Fine. If I don't meet someone
soon, you can put me in a home.

It's not a home.

It's a senior center.

We'd never put
Meemaw in a home!

Hey, guys.

Hey.
Hey.

All right, I'll bow
to social pressure: Hey!

Excuse me. That's my girlfriend,
Bernadette.

I assigned her
her own ringtone--

"Bernadette,"
by The Four Tops.

Hello, Bernadette.

When I call him, his phone
plays "Brown Eyed Girl."

Which, now that

I think about it,
is not so good.

You realize he's just
rubbing our noses in the fact

that he has a girlfriend,
and we don't.

You mean, you don't.

You have a girlfriend?

How could you have a girlfriend?

You can't even speak to women.

Two words-- deaf chick.

It doesn't matter

if I can't talk,
because she can't hear me.

What?

That's what she said.

Great. You have a girlfriend,
Howard's got a girlfriend,

Sheldon's got
a girl...
No, no, no, no!

who's a friend.

Thank you.

What about you, Stuart?

You have a
girlfriend yet?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

I met her at Comic-Con,
the one place in the world

where saying
"I own a comic bookstore"

is an actual pickup line.

Oh. Well, good for you.

Not really. She's horrible.

When she wants to have sex,

she puts on her plus-size
Wonder Woman costume and shouts,

"Who wants to take a ride
in my invisible plane?"

Why don't you just
break up with her?

No, no, I can't.

Why not?

'Cause then I'd be alone,

like you.

Dude, why don't you just invoke
your girlfriend pact

with Wolowitz?

Because I don't
need his girlfriend

to set me up with one
of her girlfriends.

I'm perfectly capable of
finding a girl on my own.

Oh, Leonard, you remind me

of the funny old story
about a man

who walks into a women's
correctional institution

with a stack of paperwork

that will allow
the female convicts to go free.

You're saying I
couldn't get laid

in a women's prison with
a handful of pardons.

Are you going to let me
tell the story or not?

Leonard?

Are you sleeping?

No.

Are you ill?

No.

Are you still depressed

because you're alone,
and no one loves you?

I don't know. Maybe.

I want you to know
that I'm genuinely concerned

about your well-being.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

But it's still no reason
to have your feet in my spot.

May I offer an observation?

What the hell?
How long has she been here?

Since we got home
from the comic bookstore.

That was two hours ago.

As per your suggestion,

we're hanging out.

Quite frankly, I don't see

what all the hoopla's about.

Go on, Amy.

From a neurobiological
standpoint, Leonard,

you may be alone
because your psychological state

is causing
an actual pheromone-based stink

of desperation.

Did you know that, Leonard?

No.
I did.

I understand
that some people find mates

in social gathering places
such as bars or taverns.

Have you tried a bar or tavern?

No, I'm not gonna try
to pick up a woman in a bar.

Wise decision. You see, Amy,

success at a bar is based
on classic male attributes

such as height, strength,
attractiveness,

the ability to hold one's liquor
and throw darts--

separately or together.

Leonard has none of these
attributes, right, Leonard?

Right.

That's not true of all bars.

Juice bars, for example.

Oh! Good point, Amy.

Yeah, building
on your premise,

Leonard could
frequent sushi bars,

salad bars, oyster bars,

the Apple Genius Bar...
What are you doing?

Keep going. I'm listening.

That was rude.

He does it all the time.

He's a cornucopia
of social awkwardness.

Cornucopia.

What a mellifluous word.

Let's make that our word
of the day.

Agreed. And we'll use
mellifluous tomorrow.

Well, I have to void my bladder.

It was nice spending this time
with you.

Wait.

I have a request.

Yes?

I'd like you to meet my mother.

I see.

Can I get back to you on that?

Certainly. Good night.

Good night.

Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
Leonard, Leonard,

Leonard, Leonard,
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
Leonard, Leonard,

Leonard, Leonard,

Leonard, Leonard...

Yeah, what?

Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me
to meet her mother.

Yeah. So?

What does that mean?

Well, you know
how you're always saying

that Amy is a girl
who's your friend,

and not your girlfriend?

Uh-huh.
You can't say
that anymore.

Wait. What?

Look, she obviously wants

to take your relationship
to the next level.

I don't want
the next level.

I like this level.

Fix it for me!

Me?

Well, how am I supposed
to fix it?

Simple! You want a girlfriend,

Amy wants
to be someone's girlfriend.

Take her off my hands.
I give you my blessing.

That is insane.

You're right.
It would never work.

Amy finds you tedious.

Okay, good luck.

Wait! What am I
supposed to do?

Well, have you considered
telling her how you feel?

Leonard, I'm a physicist,
not a hippie.

All right, well, let me see

if I can explain your situation
using physics.

What would you be

if you were attached
to another object

by an inclined plane wrapped
helically around an axis?

Screwed.

There you go.

Amy's right.

He is tedious.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, get the door!

Why can't you get it?

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
You know I'm doing a bowel cleanse

for my colonoscopy!

I'm like an upside-down
volcano here.

Oh, hey.

I hope you didn't hear that.

The volcano thing? No.

What's with the T-shirt?

You working at the
Apple store now?

No, it's just something
I threw on.

I know all your shirts.

That's not one of them...

You were pretending to
work at the Genius Bar

to pick up women,
weren't you?

Yeah.

Turns out,
they guard the iPods,

but they don't
guard the shirts.

So, how'd it go?

It was going well.

I was showing
this super hot girl

how to boot up in Safe Mode.

The manager got suspicious,
and, well, long story short,

they really do have
a little jail in the mall.

Just FYI, don't try to go
back with a fake mustache.

I mean, they may not
really be geniuses,

but they see
right through that.

I want to invoke
the girlfriend pact, Howard.

You that desperate?

No, I just...
I want what you have.

You know, I want
a woman in my life.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Holy Moses,

how much liquid can
be in one tokus?

To be clear, I meant like
Bernadette, not your mother.

Yeah, I know
what you mean.

Well, I'm off to meet
Bernadette's friend.

How do I look?

As if one of the plants

from
Invasion of the Body Snatchers

duplicated you in every way,

only with an absurd
amount of hair gel.

What are you
working on?

I'm removing
my digital footprint

from the Internet

so Amy Farrah Fowler
can't find me

and compel me to meet her mother.
Ah.

You're going off the grid.

Exactly.

The old Unabomber approach.
Kudos.

Thank you.

I've also sent Amy a
relationship termination notice

and changed my cell phone number
and e-mail address.

What if she just comes over?

She'll get lost.

We no longer live
at 2311 Los Robles.

We now live at 311 Los Robles.

You changed the address
on the building?

What about mail?

Oh, no worries--
I explained my predicament

to our letter carrier.

He was sympathetic.

His exact words were:

"Got your back, Jack.

Bitches be crazy."

Who is it?

Amy Farrah Fowler.

Darn! She found me!

She's been here before.

The only flaw in an
otherwise perfect plan.

Now, get my back, Jack.

What do you want to do?
Tell her I'm not here.

Okay, where are you?
I don't know.

You'll have to devise a scenario

that plausibly
explains my absence,

keeping in mind that the key to
a good lie lies in the details.

Hi, Amy.

Sheldon's not here.

All right.

Way to go on the details.

Thanks again for
doing this, Bernadette.

Oh, I take pacts
very seriously.

One time at my lab,
a petri dish

of genetically modified
super-virus went missing.

That day we made a pinky swear
never to admit

we crossed Ebola
with the common cold.

Why the hell

would you cross Ebola
with the common cold?

We never did.

That would be
a terrible, terrible thing.

Hi. Sorry I'm late--
I was at the gym.

Spin class--
worked up quite a sweat.

Joy, this is Leonard.
Leonard, this is Joy.

Hi.
Hi.

You don't look
like a genius.

Go ahead, say
something smart.

Uh...
Aah! Time's up.

Just kidding.

First thing you need
to know about me:

I'm hilarious.

Yeah.

So, Bernadette tells me

she knows you from
self-defense classes?

Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga.

Lots of fun.

Basically,
a hundred different ways

to rip a guy's nuts off.

Wow. Wouldn't think there'd

be that many.
Number 42!

Whoa!

Isn't she a pip?

Proxima Centauri's
the nearest star.

The celestial bodies
that follow are

Alpha Centauri A, Toli,

Barnard's Star,

Wolf 359...

Lalande 21185,

Sirius A, Sirius B,

BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti,

Ross 154...

Ross 248...

Epsilon Eridani,

Lac-9352,

Ross 128,

Procyon A...

Oh, darn, that's wrong!

EZ Aquarii A,

EZ Aquarii B,

EZ Aquarii C,

Procyon A.

Those are the stars
that are nearest to me.

Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee.

Oh, dear.

They really do be crazy.

This lobster's good
on the way down

and the way up.

Should be-- it's
$30 a pound.

Hey, this is a date, right?

Yep, it is.

73!
Whoa!

Excuse me, I have to go
to the little girls' room...

and take a wicked whiz.

I'll go with you.

Fair warning--
I had the asparagus.

My pea is gonna
stink up the place.

I think she likes you.

EZ Aquarii B...

EZ Aquarii C...

Excuse me, madam.

Sheldon?

Rats!

I believe a misunderstanding
may have occurred

when I asked you
to meet my mother.

No misunderstanding.

I've learned what that
request actually means,

and I don't want to be
joined to another object

by an inclined plane wrapped
helically around an axis.

In what way are
you screwed?

All I want to do is present you
as my boyfriend to my mother

so she'll be satisfied
that I'm in a relationship.

So we'd be
perpetrating a ruse?

Precisely.

And you haven't fallen
hopelessly in love with me?

Don't be absurd.

I find the notion
of romantic love

to be an unnecessary
cultural construct

that adds no value to
human relationships.

Amy Farrah Fowler, that's
the most pragmatic thing

anyone has ever said to me.

I trust this clarification
allows us to return

to boy-slash-friend-slash-
girl-slash-friend status.

Of course.

Would you like to join me
for Chinese food?

Sheldon, please,
you're suffocating me.

My apologies.

Good night, Amy.
Good night, Sheldon.

Come on, just
give her a chance.

Maybe she'll grow on you.

Or maybe she'll finally succeed in
ripping my nuts off.

There are still 93 ways
she hasn't tried yet.

Look, H-Howard,
I appreciate

the effort, but this is, like,
the worst date of my life.

Seriously?

I was once robbed by a pre-op
transsexual I met on J-Date,

and that didn't
even crack my top ten.

I guess the difference is,
I have some self-respect.

Not that I've ever seen.

It's relatively new.

I just know that

I'm not gonna spend time
with someone I don't like

simply to have a girlfriend.

I'm okay on my own.

Good news-- I made
lots of room for dessert.

Look, uh, Joy, it was nice
to meet you, but...

Yeah, you, too.
Hey, you got anything for next weekend?

I need a date for
my cousin's wedding.

You're asking me out?

Yeah.

And it's an open bar,

so I'll probably
be giving it away.

I look forward to it.

MRS. FOWLER
It's nice to meet you, too, Sheldon.

I honestly didn't believe Amy

when she told me
she had a boyfriend.

I assure you I am quite real

and I'm having regular intercourse
with your daughter.

What?

Oh, yes.

We're like wild
animals in heat.

It's a wonder neither
of us has been hurt.

Amy... what is he saying?

You wanted me to have
a boyfriend, Mother.

Well, here he is.

Have to sign off now.

My hunger for Sheldon
is stirring in my loins.

Oh, yes, it's time
for me to make love

to your daughter's vagina.

Thank you, Sheldon,
that went very well.

Agreed.

Amy, I find
myself wondering

if we should actually
engage in coitus

at least one time
in our relationship.

Bazinga.

Bedtime. Please
show yourself out.



On the other hand, some physicists are
concerned that if this supercollider works...

it'll create a black hole and swallow up
the Earth, ending life as we know it.

What a bunch of crybabies.

No guts, no glory, man.

Hey, check it out.

The School of Pharmacology
is looking for volunteers.

"We are testing a new medication
for social anxiety...

panic attacks, agoraphobia
and obsessive-compulsive disorder."

Why would they be looking
for test subjects here?

I don't know, Raj.

Maybe the comic-book store
doesn't have a bulletin board.

 What's going on?
 Shh! Hot girl in Sheldon's office.

Sheldon's office?

Is she lost?

I don't think so.
I followed her here from the parking lot.

 Maybe she's his lawyer.
 Well, she's free to examine my briefs.

 Howard...
 I know, I'm disgusting.

I should be punished.

By her. Oh, look, I did it again.

 Thank you for coming by.

Hello.

Oh, hey, buddy.

Buddy?

Sorry I'm late.
I'm working on a project...

that may take me up
on the next space shuttle.

Well, how can you be late?
I wasn't expecting you at all.

Nobody ever expects me.

Sometimes you just look,
and bam, Howard Wolowitz.

 Sheldon, are you gonna introduce us?
 Oh, all right. This is Missy.

Missy, this is Leonard and Rajesh,
and you've already met Howard.

 It's nice to meet you.
 You too, as well also.

Yeah.

So how do you two know each other?

Oh, he once spent nine months
with my legs wrapped around his head.

Excuse me?

She's my twin sister.

She thinks she's funny, but frankly,
I've never been able to see it.

That's because you have
no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.

How exactly would one measure
a sense of humor?

A humormometer?

Well, I think you're delightfully droll.
Or as the French say:


Okay, so let me see if I got this.
Leonard, Howard and...

I'm sorry, what was your name again?

Rajesh.

So, Missy, what brings you
all the way from Texas?

Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.

My friend's getting married at Disneyland.

Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.

And I had to drop off some papers
for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.

The papers could've been mailed. Mom
sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?

I guess that's why
they call you a genius.

They call me a genius
because I'm a genius.

Tell Mom
that I currently weigh 165 pounds...

and that I'm having
regular bowel movements.

Enjoy the wedding. Goodbye.

 Whoa, whoa.
 Whoa, whoa.

If the wedding's not till tomorrow,
why don't you stay with us tonight?

Oh, I don't think so.
Shelly doesn't like company.

Even as a little boy, he'd send his imaginary
friends home at the end of the day.

They were not friends.
They were imaginary colleagues.

Look, you're here,
and we have plenty of room.

 No, we don't.
 Come on, Shelly, she's family.

So what?
I don't issue invitations to your mother.

It would be nice not to have to drive
to Anaheim in rush hour.

And don't ever call me Shelly.

So it's settled. You'll stay with us.

I'll walk you to your car.
You're in Structure 3, Level C, right?

What just happened?

So anyway, we're 8 years old...

and Sheldon converts my Easy-Bake Oven
to some kind of high-powered furnace.

That's just classic.

I needed a place to fire
ceramic semiconductor substrates...

for homemade integrated circuits.

He was trying to build some sort of
armed robot to keep me out of his room.

Made necessary by her insistence
on going into my room.

Anyway, I make those little muffins
they give you. There's a big flash.

Next thing you know,
my eyebrows are gone.

Not your eyebrows?

Yep, I had to go through
the entire second grade...

with crooked eyebrows
my mom drew on.

Is that what that was? I just assumed...

that the second-grade curriculum
had rendered you quizzical.


Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear
in the drier downstairs.

Pfft.

Those are not mine.

Really? They have
your little name label in them.

Oh, yeah, no, I use those...

just to polish up
my spearfishing equipment.

I spearfish.

When I'm not crossbow hunting,
I spearfish.

Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister.
Missy, this is our neighbor Penny.

 Hi.
 Wow, you don't look that much alike.

Can I get a hallelujah?

Fraternal twins
come from two separate eggs.

They are no more alike
than any other siblings.

Hallelujah.

Hey, guess what.

I've been accepted as a test subject
for a drug...

to overcome pathological shyness.

 Oh, good for you, Raj.
 Yes, I'm very hopeful.

Hello, Missy.

They mentioned
there may be side effects.

So, Missy...

have you ever met a man
from the exotic subcontinent of India?

 Well, there's Dr. Patel at our church.
 Yes, Patel. Good man.

Do you like motorcycles?
Because I ride a hog.

A hog? You have a two-cylinder scooter
with a basket in the front.

You still have to wear a helmet.

 Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
 The sex book.

The Indian sex book.

In other words, if you wonder, wonder
who wrote the book of love...

it was us.

 So Sheldon's sister is pretty cute, huh?
 I wasn't staring.

I didn't say you were.
I just said she was cute.

Oh. Eh...

Maybe. If you like women who are tall.

And perfect.

Sheldon,
why are you ignoring your sister?

I'm not ignoring my sister.
I'm ignoring all of you.

I brought snacks.

Oh, my. Gherkins and...

Onion dip. It's onion dip.

We don't entertain much.

Missy. Do you enjoy pajamas?

 I guess.
 Yeah, we Indians invented them.

You're welcome.

Yeah, well,
my people invented circumcision.

You're welcome.

Missy, I'm gonna go get my nails done.
Do you wanna come?

God, yes. Thanks.

You're welcome.

 Bye, guys.
 Bye, Missy.

Bye, Missy, see you.

 Goodbye, Leonard.
 Yeah, no, bye, Penny.

 You two have to back off.
 Why should I back off? You back off.

Excuse me, this is my apartment,
and she's my roommate's sister.

 So what? You've got Penny.
 How do I have Penny?

In what universe do I have Penny?

 So I can have Penny?
 Hell, no.

Excuse me, can I interject something?

I'm ordering pizza online.
Is everyone okay with pepperoni?

 Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
 I guess.

Don't worry,
I was going to order you cheese-less.

 Thank you.

Lactose intolerance
is nothing to be embarrassed about.

Indian man. We invented pajamas.

Hey, look at me, I don't have a foreskin.

Sheldon.

Are you aware that your sister
is an incredibly attractive woman?

Hm.

She has the symmetry and low body fat
that Western culture deems desirable.

It's noteworthy that at other points
in history...

heavier women were the standard for
beauty because girth suggested affluence.

 That's fascinating...
 I didn't say fascinating.

I said it was noteworthy.

All right. Noted.

But my point
is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz...

They're hitting on your sister.
Ugh. It's...

Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want
to criticize your rhetorical style...

but we'd be further along
in this conversation...

if you'd begun with that thought.

That's great, but...

We took quite a detour
from what I understand to be your thesis.

Whatever.

 You have to do something about it.
 Why?

Because she's your sister.

I don't understand.

Yes, we shared a uterus
for nine months.

But since then, we've pretty much gone
our own separate ways.

Okay, consider this.

With your father gone,
it is your responsibility...

to make sure
that Missy chooses a suitable mate.

I hadn't considered that.

We do share DNA.

So there is the possibility,
however remote...

that resting in her loins
is the potential for another individual...

as remarkable as myself.

Exactly. And you owe it to yourself
and to posterity...

to protect the genetic integrity
of your sister's future offspring.

You're right. If someone wants
to get at Missy's fallopian tubes...

they'll have to go through me.


I am Shiva, the destroyer.
I will have the woman.

I'm warning you.
I was judo champion at math camp.

All right.
That's enough juvenile squabbling.

You stop it. You stop it, I say.

I'm gonna settle this right now.

Neither of you are good enough
for my sister.

Who are you to decide that?

He's the man of his family.
You have to respect his wishes.

 You're out too, by the way.
 Say what?

Nothing personal.
I'd prefer my niece or nephew...

didn't become flatulent
every time they ate an Eskimo Pie.

 What are you so happy about?
 I'm not happy.

It's the medication. I can't stop smiling.

Now that Leonard's made me aware
of how high the genetic stakes are...

we have to face the fact
that none of you are suitable for my sister.

Wait a minute,
Leonard made you aware of that?

We all make mistakes. Let's move on.

Excuse me, but I think you're missing
a big opportunity here.

 How so?
 Everybody knows genetic diversity...

produces the strongest offspring.

Why not put a little mocha
in the family latte?

In principle, you have a point.

But as a practical matter, need I remind you
it takes experimental pharmaceuticals...

to simply enable you
to speak to the opposite sex?

I think you're focusing
entirely too much on the drugs.

Is it because I'm Jewish?

Because I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop
to be with your sister.

This has nothing to do with religion.

This has to do with the fact
that you're a tiny man...

who still lives with his mother.

 Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.
 Am I?

Here. Eat this cheese without farting,
and you can sleep with my sister.

Oh, really?

Oops.

Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?
Alone.

Why does everyone
suddenly wanna talk to me alone?

Usually nobody wants
to be alone with me.

We all make mistakes. Let's move on.

Okay.

I'm not even gonna ask
why you're pimping me out for cheese...

but since when do you care at all
about who I sleep with?

Truthfully,
I've never given it any thought...

but it has been pointed out to me
that you carry DNA of great potential.

 What on earth are you talking about?
 Let me explain.

You see,
I'm a superior genetic mutation...

an improvement
on the existing mediocre stock.

And what do you mean,
"mediocre stock"?

That would be you.

But residing within you
is the potential for another me.

Perhaps even taller, smarter
and less prone to freckling.

A Sheldon 2.0, if you will.

 Sheldon 2.0?
 Exactly.

Now, I am not saying that I should be
the sole decider of who you mate with.

If you're not attracted, then the likelihood
of conception will be reduced.

 You have got to be kidding me.
 Not at all.

Frequent coitus dramatically increases
the odds of fertilization.

Okay, Shelly, sit down.

Now, I've lived my whole life dealing
with the fact that my twin brother is...

as Mom puts it,
one of God's special little people.

I always thought
I was more like a cuckoo bird.

A superior creature whose egg is placed
in the nest of ordinary birds.

The newly hatched cuckoo
eats all the food...

leaving the ordinary siblings
to starve to death.

Luckily for you,
that's where the metaphor ended.

I thought it ended at cuckoo.

Now, you listen to me.

If you wanna start acting like a brother
who cares about me, terrific.

Bring it on.

But you try one time to tell me
who I should be sleeping with...

and you and I are gonna go round the way
we did when we were little. Remember?

 I have an alternate proposal.
 Go on.

You donate eggs.
We will place them in cryogenic storage.

I will find an appropriate sperm donor
for your eggs...

have them fertilized
and implanted in you.

That way, everybody wins.

Correction.
Missy can date whoever she wants.

 Look, we have to settle this.
 I agree.

Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's
because we've all been hitting on her.

She's not hiding. She needed to call her
grandmother, who's apparently very sick.

Oh, and then I believe
she has to wash her hair.

Oh, you poor deluded bastard.

 Don't start with me, dude.
 You wanna go again?

 Sit down.
 Okay.

If we're gonna fight over Missy,
let's do it the right way.

The honorable way.

Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

Take that.

You want some more?

And he's down.

One, two, three, four...

 Come on, come on! Get up.
 Stay down, bitch.

Seven, eight, nine, 10.


Yeah! Natural selection at work.

I weep for humanity.

Excuse me
while I go tell Missy the good news.

 Hey.
 Hi, Penny, how's it going?

That guy Mike that you were dating,
is that still going on?

 Pretty much, why?
 Just catching up.

By the way,
may I speak to Missy, please?

Of course.

Hi, Leonard, what's up?

Well, since you're leaving, I was wondering
if you'd like to go to dinner with me.

That's so sweet. But no, thanks.

Oh.

 Do you have other plans or...?
 No.

All right.

 Enjoy the rest of your evening.
 Thanks, I'll see you.

Um, here's something
we didn't anticipate.

 What do you want, Howard?
 I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

I've come to call on Missy.

Missy.

 Hi, Howard.
 The Amazing Howard.

 Do you like magic?
 Not really, no.

Then you are in for a treat.

Behold, an ordinary cane.


Ta-da.

No.

Okay.


Missy.

Thank you, I apprec...

Apprec...

Appre...

Uh-oh.

Oh, honey,
is your medication wearing off?

Well, hi, cutie pie.
I was hoping you'd show up.



We had a dog
who made a noise like that.

Had to put him down.

Any news you want me
to pass along to Mom?

Well, she might be interested to know
that I've refocused my research...

from bosonic string theory
to heterotic string theory.

Yeah, I'll just tell her you said, "Hey."

Okay. Well, it was pleasant seeing you.

Other than that business
with my testicles.

Come on, Shelly.

I want you to know
I'm very proud of you.

 Really?
 Yep.

I'm always bragging to my friends
about my brother, the rocket scientist.

You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?

 Well, yeah.
 I'm a theoretical physicist.

 What's the difference?
 What's the difference?

 Goodbye, Shelly.
 My God.

Why don't you just tell them that
I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge?

A rocket scientist, how humiliating.




Problem?

The online description
was completely misleading.

They said eight slots plus removable ID.

To any rational person,
that would mean room for nine cards.

But they don't tell you,
the removable ID takes up one slot.

It's a nightmare.

Okay, now, do you really need...

the honorary Justice League
of America membership card?

It's been in every wallet
I've owned since I was 5.

Why?

It says, "Keep this on your person
at all times."


It's right here, under Batman's signature.

And this is Leonard
and Sheldon's apartment.

Guess whose parents just got broadband.

Leonard, may I present, live from New Delhi,
Dr. and Mrs. V. M. Koothrappali?

Hi.

Tilt up the camera.
I'm looking at his crotch.

Sorry, Papa.

 Oh, that's much better. Hi.
 Hi.

 And over here is Sheldon.

He lives with Leonard.

Oh, that's nice. Like Haroon and Tanvir.

No, not like Haroon and Tanvir.

Such sweet young men.

They just adopted
the cutest little Punjabi baby.

Yeah. No, we're not
like Haroon and Tanvir.

 So are you boys academics like our son?
 Yes.

Your parents are comfortable
with limited earning potential?

 Oh, yes.
 Not at all.

Papa, please don't start.

What? It's just a question.
He's so sensitive.

That's my life, my friends.
Good to see you. Say bye.

 Bye.
 Bye-bye.

Wait, wait.

Before you go, we have good news.

Put the computer down
and gather your friends.

 What is it, Papa?
 I don't see your friends.

Is it just me or does web-chatting with
your clothes on seem a little pointless?

Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta?

The little fat girl that used to kick me
in the samosas and call me untouchable?

Yes. Well, now she's
a dental student at USC...

so we gave her
your contact information.

Why did you do that?

You're 26 years old, Rajesh.
We want grandchildren.

 But, Papa, I'm not supposed...
 Lalita's parents approved the match.

If you decide on a spring wedding,
we can avoid monsoon season.

A spring wedding?

It's up to you. We don't want to meddle.

If you don't want to meddle,
why are you meddling?

Your parents
don't consider this meddling.

While arranged marriages
are no longer the norm...

Indian parents continue to have
an involvement in their children's love lives.

Why are you telling me
about my own culture?

You seemed confused.

 Sorry, but with all due respect, I don't...
 I'm sorry, darling. We have to go.

Doogie Howser is on.

Grandma, it's Doogie time.

 Bye-bye.
 Bye-bye.

I don't believe it.

Neither do I.

Doogie Howser's been off the air
for like 20 years.

Actually, I read that it's one of
the most popular programs in India.

Might speak to a cultural aspiration to have
one's children enter the medical profession.

I bet you're right.

 I bet they love Scrubs.
 What's not to love?

Excuse me, hello?

My parents are trying to marry me off
to a stranger. What am I going to do?

 I suggest you go through with it.
 What?

Romantic love as the basis for marriage
has only existed since the 19th century.

Up until then, arranged marriages were
the norm and it served society quite well.

It's the premise of Fiddler on the Roof.

I'm not a big fan of musicals,
but I love that show.

Me too. Of course,
it speaks to me culturally.

Understandable, but there's a universality
to that story which transcends ethnicity.

Let's not forget
it's got some really catchy tunes.

 Oh, yeah.
 Absolutely.

 I know what I'm gonna do.
 What?

Find new friends.


 So who wants to rent Fiddler?
 No need. We have the special edition.

Well, maybe we are like
Haroon and Tanvir.

This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Yeah, I need to cancel my membership
to the planetarium.


Yeah, well, I'm sorry too...

but there's just no room
for you in my wallet.

No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History...

and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs.

Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-bye.

Okay, I know you're texting about me
and I'd really like you to stop.


Oh, dear, I am rightly and truly screwed.

I thought you were finding new friends.

I've got some feelers out.

In the meantime, listen to this.

Hi, Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta.

Your mother gave my mother
your phone number to give to me.

So I'm calling you and call me back.

Bye.

Can you believe how pushy she is?

So don't call her.

If I don't call her,
I won't hear the end of it.

 So call her.
 How can I call her? I can't talk to women.

I'm done. Anybody else?


 Give me the phone.
 Why?

Just give it to me. Sh.

 What are you doing?
 Don't worry, you'll thank me.

Hello, Lalita? Raj Koothrappali.


Yes, it is good to talk to you too.

So, what are you wearing?

Oh, not important.

So anyhow,
when would you like to meet?

Friday works for me.

I'll call you with a time and place.

In the meantime, keep it real, babe.

You may now thank me.

For what, making me sound
like a Simpsons character?

 Next time, make your own date.
 Didn't wanna make this one.

Look on the bright side, she might
turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.

Great, we get married,
I won't be able to talk to her...

and we'll spend the rest of our lives
in total silence.

It worked for my parents.


 Hi, guys.
 Oh, hey.

I need guinea pigs.

Okay, there's a lab animal supply
company in Reseda you could try.

But if your research is going to have
human applications, I suggest white mice.

Their brain chemistry
is far closer to ours.

I swear to God, Sheldon, one day,
I'm gonna get the hang of talking to you.

His mom's been saying that for years.

 What's up?
 Well, I convinced the restaurant...

to give me a bartending shift
so I need to practice mixing drinks.

Oh, well, great. The key to acquiring
proficiency in any task is repetition.

With certain obvious exceptions.

Suicide, for example.

So, Leonard, how about it?

Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj
is going through some stuff right now.

And besides, he doesn't drink, so...


Really?

Um...

Raj is going through some stuff right now
and he'd like to take up drinking.

Okay, here you go, Leonard.
One Tequila Sunrise.

 Thank you.
 Mm-hm.

This drink is an example of how liquids
with different specific gravities...

interact in a cylindrical container.

Thank you.

Okay, Raj, what'll it be?


Whatever you recommend.

How about a Grasshopper?
I make a mean Grasshopper.

Okay? Good, coming up.

 Sheldon, what are you gonna have?
 I'll have a Diet Coke.

Okay, can you please order a cocktail?
I need to practice mixing drinks.

Fine. I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.

That's rum and Coke without the rum.

Yes.

So Coke.

Yes.

And would you make it diet?

There's a can in the fridge.

A Cuba Libre traditionally comes
in a tall glass with a lime wedge.

Then swim to Cuba.

Bartenders are supposed
to have people skills.

Okay. Raj, here you go.

All right. Who's next?

I'd like to try a Slippery Nipple.

Okay, you're cut off.

Anybody need a refill?

Where did my life go, Penny?

One day I'm a bachelor,
and the next I'm married...

and driving a minivan to peewee cricket
matches in suburban New Delhi.

Are you talking to me?

Is there another Penny here?

I had such plans. I had dreams.

I was going to be the Indira Gandhi
of particle astrophysics.

But with a penis, of course.

It's amazing.

Ever since I was a little boy...

my father wanted me
to be a gynecologist like him.

How can I be a gynecologist?
I can barely look a woman in the eye.

You know what? I'm not going
to let my parents control my future.

It's time for a showdown.

Somebody give me a computer
with a Webcam.

Okay. Sweetie, I think
that's the Grasshopper talking.

It's about to tell my parents...

that I'm not riding an elephant
down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.

Okay, calm down.

No one can make you get married.

Why don't you meet this girl,
see what happens?

Haven't you been listening?
I cannot talk to women.

 Raj...
 No, no, let's see how long it takes him.

Raj, honey...

you say you can't talk to women
but you've been talking to me.

And now we'll never know.

You're right. I...

I am talking to you.

Hello, Penny. How are you?

I'm fine.

Okay, now, I need to
make sure I have a Lalita...

before I meet the Grasshopper.

It's a sweet green miracle.

If you're gonna drink on this date,
just promise me you won't overdo it.

Overdo what?

Happiness?

Freedom?

This warm glow inside of me that promises
everything's going to be all hunky dunky?

Yeah, that.

Why don't you bring her to my restaurant
so I can keep an eye on you?

Okay.

What's the plan? Let's say he meets her,
he likes her, they get married.

What's he gonna do,
stay drunk for the rest of his life?

It worked for my parents.


I can't believe I'm sitting here
next to little Lalita Gupta.

Well, you are.

Little Lalita.

That's kind of fun to say.

Little Lalita, little Lalita, little Lalita.

 You should try it.
 Oh, it's okay.

You have lost so much weight.

That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat.

Do you remember?

 Yes, I do.
 Of course you do.

Who could forget being that fat?

Well, I've been trying.

 So you're a dental student?
 Hmm.

Mm! Are you aware that dentists
have an extremely high suicide rate?

Not as high as air traffic controllers,
but there are far more dentists...

than air traffic controllers,
so in pure numbers, you're still winning.

Yay, me.

Do you have a drink
that'll make him less obnoxious?

Drinks do not work that way.

I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her.

The last girl my mom set me up with
had a mustache and a vestigial tail.

 Sorry I'm late.
 What happened?

Nothing. I just really didn't wanna come.

Virgin diet Cuba Libre, please.

 Okay.
 In a tall glass with a lime wedge.

Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.

So how's Koothrappali...?

Oh, my Lord.

 What?
 That's Princess Panchali.

I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.

No, no. Princess Panchali
from The Monkey and The Princess.

Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online
but they wanted my credit card.

It's a children's story.

Oh, no, it isn't.

When I was a little boy and got sick,
which was most of the time...

my mother would read it.

It's about an Indian princess
who befriends a monkey...

who was mocked by the other monkeys
because he was different.

For some reason,
I related to it quite strongly.

I know the reason.

We all know the reason.

Sheldon, what are you getting at?

That woman looks exactly like the pictures
of Princess Panchali in the book.

How often does one see a beloved
fictional character come to life?

Every year at Comic-Con.

Every day at Disneyland.

You can hire Snow White
to come to your house.

Of course, they prefer it if you have a kid.

Hey, guys. This is Lalita Gupta.

Lalita, this is Leonard and Sheldon
and Howard and Penny.

Isn’t it great? She isn't fat anymore.

Forgive me, Your Highness...

for I am but a monkey
and it is in my nature to climb.

I did not mean to gaze upon you
as you comb your hair.

I'm sorry?

You are the living embodiment
of the beautiful Princess Panchali.

Oh, no kidding. Who is that?

A beloved character
from an Indian folktale.

Oh.

Us Indian
or "come to our casino" Indian?

 You Indian.
 Oh.

The resemblance is remarkable.

I can practically smell the lotus blossoms
woven into your ebony hair.

Well, thanks.

I imagine you smell very nice too.

I shower twice a day
and wash my hands as often as I can.

Really? So do I.

But you're a dentist, he's nuts.

Don't be insulting, Rajesh.

So, Sheldon, tell me more about
this princess you say I look like.

It was said that the gods
fashioned her eyes out of the stars...

and that roses were ashamed to bloom
in the presence of her ruby lips.

Oh, my.

 Back off, Sheldon.
 What?

If you do not stop hitting on my lady,
you will feel the full extent of my wrath.

I'm not hitting on her.

And I am not your lady.

And you have no wrath.

You are my lady. Our parents said so.

We are, for all purposes,
100 percent hooked up.

Let's get something straight.

The only reason I came tonight
was to get my parents off my case.

I don't need to be getting
this old-world crap from you.

That's the kind of spirit with which Princess
Panchali led the monkeys to freedom.

 Screw Panchali.
 You can't talk to me like that.

But you're not Princess Panchali.

Luckily for you.
She could have you beheaded.

 Sheldon, are you hungry?
 I could eat.

Let's go.

What just happened?

Beats the hell out of me.

I'll tell you what happened. I just
learned how to pick up Indian chicks.

supposed to say to Lalita's parents?

I play golf with her father.
I won't be able to look at him.

Maybe you should keep
your eye on the ball, Papa.

Oh, now you're a funnyman?
This is not funny, Mr. Funnyman.

Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, in all fairness,
it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.

 This is a family matter, Sheldon.
 No, I'm Leonard.

Oh. Sorry. You all look alike to us.

But he's right, Papa. Listen to him.


You, you are the one
who ruined everything.

Who is it? We can't see.

Turn us. Turn us.

Go ahead, tell my parents why
they won't have any grandchildren.

How would I know?
Do you have a low sperm count?

This has nothing to do
with my sperm count.

You are wearing the boxers
that we sent you, aren't you?

Yes, Mommy.

You know what happens to the samosas
when you wear the tighty whities.

Can we please stop talking
about my testicles?

 Sheldon, tell them what you did.
 What did I do?

You left with his date.

Friends don't do that to each other.

Oh.

All right, noted.

 Sorry.
 "Sorry"? That's all you can say is "sorry"?

Take it, Raj.
It's more than I've ever gotten.

And may I point out...

she wouldn't have asked me to go
if you weren't drunk and boring.

 Drunk?
 And boring. Her words.

I knew it, he moves to America
and becomes an alcoholic.

I'm not an alcoholic.

Then why were you drunk?

It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.

Are you in denial? Do we have
to come over and do an intervention?

Don't embarrass him
in front of his friends.

All right. Carry us outside.

We want to talk to you in private.

 But, Papa, please...
 Now, Rajesh.

I have to go.

 At least wait till I get into the hall.


Okay, well, good night.

Hold on.

What happened with you and Lalita?

We ate, she lectured me on the link
between gum disease and heart attacks...

nothing I didn't already know,
and I came home.

So you're not gonna see her again?

Why would I see her again?

I already have a dentist.

I wonder who's gonna tell his parents
that they're not having grandchildren.



L'chaim, l'chaim, to life

Life has a way of amusing us

Blessing and bruising us

Drink l'chaim, to life

What's gotten into him?

that turned out to be kind of slutty.

You didn't.

Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine.

To life




It's amazing people keep coming
to comic book stores...

instead of just downloading
comics digitally.

It's probably for the best.

For a lot of these guys,
the weekly trip here...

is the only chance their mom has to go
to the basement and change their sheets.


Oh, that reminds me,
I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.

Well, what do you think
of new comic book night?

Magic, huh?

Sheldon, I'm disappointed.

As a brilliant man,
you're entitled to a vice.

I could understand frequenting
an opium den...

or hunting your fellow man
for sport.

But this? Lame-o.

A, comic books employ storytelling
through sequential art...

a medium that dates back 17,000 years
to the cave paintings of Lascaux...

and B, you play the harp,
like that's cool.

Can I help you find anything?

A comic that depicts a woman whose
bosom can't be used as a flotation device.

Sorry. Most of the guys
who come in here like big boobs.

A couple of them have big boobs.

The new Warlords of Ka'a
expansion pack is out.

A new one? Unbelievable.

They just keep making up
more cheesy monsters...

slapping them on cards
and selling them at 25 bucks a pop.

It's like a secret tax on guys
who can't get laid.

They're not even trying. Remember the
Satanimals pack with the Hellephant?

Absurd. What was he, a bad elephant
who died and went to hell?

What could an elephant possibly do that
would cause him eternal damnation?

"Wild West and Witches."

What kind of loser
cares about a showdown...

between Billy the Kid
and the White Wizard of the North? Heh.

A total loser.

Obviously, a guy with a six-shooter
beats an old man with a magic wand.

Well, ho... hold on.

Uh, what if the wizard casts
a helmet-of-confusion spell...

on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?

What? Please.
This is Billy the Kid we're talking about.

The wizard would get shot
before he could get out the words:

"What the hell is Billy the Kid doing
in the mystic realm of Ka'a?"

Leonard, ahem...

what's the deal
with Sheldon's friend Amy?

 Are they a couple?
 A couple of weirdos. Why?


Are you interested in Amy?

Well, I mean,
she didn't look through me...

with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling
hatred and contempt.

I like that in a woman.

Could you run it by Sheldon
if I could ask her out?

Sure, I guess.

Stuart, settle an argument for us.

Who would win,
Billy the Kid or the white Wizard?


If I tell you that, I'm robbing you
of the hours of fun you could have...

for the magical, rootin'-tootin
low price of 24.95.

 I'll take one.
 Mm. Make it two.

I hate all of you and myself. Three.

I'll ring it up.

Like shooting nerds in a barrel.

Hey, can I talk to you about something?
It's a little awkward.

I know what this is about.

Given the professional standstill
you're at...

you're wondering
if this is the appropriate time...

to abandon your research
and focus on teaching.

Yes.

And if I may suggest,
consider changing disciplines.

Yeah, to the humanities.
Perhaps, history.

One of the advantages
of teaching history...

is that you don't have
to create things.

You know, you just have to remember
stuff that happened...

and then parrot it back.

You could have fun with that.

Yeah, that's not it.

Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.

Well, of course, he is.
She's very interesting.

Did you know, when she was 14...

she severed the webbing
between her own toes?

No. Uh...

He wanted me to find out if you'd have
a problem with him asking her out.

Well, I'm not sure how to respond,
Leonard.

I mean, I don't own Amy.
You can't own a person.

At least, not since...

1863.

President Lincoln freed the...

The slaves. Come on, Leonard,
if you're gonna teach history...

these are the kind of facts
you'll have to know.

You know what? Never mind.
I'm gonna tell him it's okay to ask her out.

The question is moot.
There is no way that Stuart...

an impoverished peddler
of picture books...

would be at all appealing
to Amy Farrah Fowler...

a noted neurobiologist...

capable of performing surgery
on her own feet...

with nothing but nitrous oxide from
cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.

All right, but for the record...

I checked in with you
to see how you'd feel about it.

Fine. The record shall so reflect.

Now, getting back
to the problem at hand...

what to do with a washed-up
experimental physicist.

I am not washed-up.

Oh, Leonard.

Lots of people love you
and want to help you...

but they can't
until you admit the problem.

Ugh. Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.

 I had half a glass.
 I didn't have any.

Okay, don't judge me.

So, what do you wanna do?
Go to the movies, go dancing...

lay down for a little bit? Ahem.

Or we play...

Travel Twister.

Amy, really? Twister?

Excuse me, I've passed many
an enjoyable evening playing this game.

And I'm sure it's a lot more exciting
when you play with other people.

What do you say, bestie? We can do
shirts and skins. I'm shirts. Called it.


I'm too small for Twister.
And roller coasters.

And sitting with my feet on the floor.

Hope you enjoyed
the prenatal cigarettes, mom.

Hey, my mom smoked pot
when she was pregnant with me...

and I turned out just fine.

Hey, look, I have peach schnapps.
Thank God.

 Guys, something happened.
 What's wrong?

I think a boy likes me.

"Hi. It's Stuart.
We met at the comic book store.

I was wondering if you'd like to get
coffee sometime. It's okay if you say no.

It might be the kick in the pants I need
to start taking Zoloft."

Amy, you little vixen.

Just working it under all those layers
of wool and polyester.

What are you gonna do?
Doesn't he know you have a boyfriend?

Oh, she doesn't have a boyfriend,
she has a Sheldon.

 So do you like Stuart?
 I don't know.

He's nice. He's funny.
He has the sallow-drawn countenance...

associated with an overactive
thyroid gland. That's kind of hot.

Look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but
you've been with him over a year now.

If it's not going anywhere,
what does it hurt to look around?

Yeah, I guess they're not engaged
like me and Howie.

For what it's worth, engaged people can
look around too. Lot of options out there.

Where's Stuart?


Out.

 Who are you?
 I'm Dale. He left me in charge.

 Really?
 Yeah.

I don't get it either.

I wanna return this Wild West
and Witches Ka'a expansion pack.

Sorry, I don't do returns. They're hard.

Sure, sure.

 Uh, when will Stuart be back?
 I don't know. He went out for coffee.

With a girl.


Ah. I guess I was wrong.

You okay?

Am I okay?
Leonard, I'm on a lifelong trajectory...

that includes a Nobel Prize
and cities named after me.

All four wisdom teeth fit comfortably
in my mouth without need of extraction...

and my bowel movements run
like a German train schedule.

Am I okay?

I'm okay too.

Wild Bill Witchcock.

A tribe of Abra-Comanches.

Flaming Spittoon.

And for the record,
I'm very disappointed in you, cowpokes.

We're playing our inaugural round
of Wild West and witches...

and I'm the only one who bothered
to dress for the occasion.

Patooie.

We're not wearing cowboy hats,
Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.

And I suppose my boots and spurs
are ridiculous too?


Did it look ridiculous
when we got the Satanimals pack...

and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?


All right, fine. Let's just play.

We should go easy on him.
Amy's out with Stuart tonight.

Wait a minute. Are you telling me...

that Sheldon's patented blend
of condescension and no sex...

isn't enough to hold on to a woman?

Cluck. Cluck. Cluck.
What are we, ladies at a quilting bee?

Or are we men
playing a fantasy card game...

set in a magical frontier town?

Sorry.

Creepy Tepee.

Annie Ogly.

Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.

And may I point out,
it is the three of you...

who are obsessed
with Stuart and Amy, not me.

I think you need to ask yourselves
who's really being ridiculous here.


 It's you.
 You are.

Hey, guys, check it out.

The deluxe limited edition
Wild West and Witches expansion pack...

in the signed and numbered
collector's tin.

Come on, no.
We just bought the regular pack.

Ooh. A sheriff's badge. Ha, ha.

Yeah, it's also a wand.

With a hologram? Nice.

Hey, do you see this?

I'm in the matrix, Leonard,
I see everything.

You gotta be kidding me.
You friended Stuart on Facebook?

 I thought you didn't like Facebook.
 Don't be silly.

I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace
actual human contact.

Please. You're looking at Facebook
to find out how their date went.

Really? You think I care if a man...

what, "Shared a pumpkin latte
with a dynamite lady"?

 You're so full of it.
 You're free to believe whatever you like.

And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.

You unfriended me? Seriously?

Oh, yeah. Now he's gonna miss
all those great updates like:

"I can't believe I waited this long...

to make my own potpourri." Ha, ha.

Why don't you acknowledge
you have feelings for Amy...

and don't want her going out
with other men?

And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.

Here's a radical thought. Go old school.
Challenge Stuart to a fight.

Nothing makes the ladies hotter
than two skinny white guys...

swatting at each other
with their eyes closed.

And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.

That's all of us. Can I use the laptop?

 Why?
 I have to buy that stupid collector's tin.

 Penny.

Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.

 Thank you.
 What's up?

I came to ask if you would like
to go on a date with me.

I'm sorry, what?

A date. You and me.

Dining, dancing,
perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight.


Ugh, God,
are you trying to make Amy jealous?

No. Why is everyone so obsessed
with Amy and Stuart?

Whether or not they may be having more
pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.

Okay, listen to me.

Playing games is not gonna help
get Amy back.

I am not trying to get her back.

But out of curiosity, what is a way?

All right, honey,
let me tell you a story.

There was a guy I liked,
and I never told him how I felt.

Eventually, he started going out with
someone else and I always regretted it.

Do you see where I'm going with this?

 I believe I do.
 Hmm.

I'm the guy.

You're not the guy.

Are you sure?
That would explain so much.

Your constant presence
in my apartment...

that baffling dalliance with Leonard
just to be near me...

the way you call me sweetie
all the time.

 I call everyone sweetie.
 You tramp.

Ugh.

Look, Sheldon, all I'm saying
is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.

Strap on a pair? Wait. Of what, skates?

Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.


If you're bored, you can go.
I understand.

No, I'm having a nice time.


Don't patronize me.

Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

Pardon me. Excuse me.

 Hi, Stuart.
 Hi, Sheldon.

Pardon me. Excuse me. Excuse me.


Sheldon, what are you doing here?

The thought of you
sitting in a darkened theater...

with a character like Stuart
is repellent.

 No offense, Stuart.
 None taken.

Although repellent
is kind of a strong word.

I'm sorry this causes you discomfort...

but based on the currently established
parameters of our relationship...

I can put myself
in any repellent situation I want.

 Um... Again...
 Stuart, please, you're being rude.

Anything else?

I believe I would like to alter
the paradigm of our relationship.

I'm listening.

With the understanding
that nothing changes whatsoever...

physical or otherwise...

I would not object
to us no longer characterizing you...

as "not my girlfriend."

Interesting. Now try it without
the quadruple negative.

You're being impossible.

Hi, Stuart.

Fine.

Amy...

will you be my girlfriend?

 Yes.
 Well, that's enough of that.

Sorry to interrupt.
You two enjoy your date.

Here's a dollar for your troubles.
Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.

Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.

Other than you taking your relationship
to the next level with another guy...

this was nice.

Yes, well,
thanks for seeing me to my door.

Oh, you're welcome.


Amy? Amy? Amy?

Let's wrap things up out there.

 Um... Good night, Stuart.
 Good night.

The lady said good night.

How did you get into my apartment?

Wow. Is that the kind of nagging
I can expect now that you're my girlfriend?

Good thing I drew this up.

What's that?

I present to you
the relationship agreement.

A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages,
enumerates, iterates and codifies...

the rights and responsibilities
of Sheldon Lee Cooper...

here and after known as
"the boyfriend"...

and Amy Farrah Fowler,
here and after known as "the girlfriend."

It's so romantic.

Mutual indemnification always is.

Why don't you start perusing
while I set up my notary stamp.


Hand-holding is only allowed
under the following circumstances.

A, either party is in danger
of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge.

B, either party is deserving of a hearty
handshake after winning a Nobel Prize.

C, moral support during flu shots."

 Seems a bit restrictive.
 Yeah, well, feel free to retain a lawyer.

Penny, I said, "Right hand, red."

Yeah, I heard you. I got red. Ahem.

Bernadette...

left foot, yellow.


We should play limbo next.
No one beats me at limbo.


Penny? Amy? Bernadette?

That's my boyfriend.

It's open.

I got a splinter.

What do you want me to do about it?

Relationship Agreement
Section 4: Boo-boos and Ouchies.

You have to take care of it.

I should've gotten a lawyer.

Looks like it's just us playing.


Penny?

 Penny, we're out of wine.
 You should probably drive.



I don't ever want to feel

Like I did that day

Take me to the place I love

Take me all the way

I don't ever want to feel

Like I did that day

Take me to the place I lo...

Fellas, please.

Penny, come on.

We were just finding our sound.

You found it.

It's the sound of a cat
being run over by a lawn mower.

I'm really very busy.

Is there any way
that we can put this off

until I have
more time to prepare?

Of course.

But, uh, you understand
my trepidation.

What's that about?

Not a clue.

Can't we just postpone it
till the spring?

Maybe next summer?

This should be fairly
easy to deduce.

He's holding the phone
to his left ear.

Ears do not cross hemispheres,
so he's using the analytical

rather than the emotional side
of the brain, suggesting that

he has no personal
relationship with the caller.

No, I didn't realize

it had been so long.

Sure, I guess
there's no other choice

but to just go ahead and do it.

He's referring to an
activity he has done before.

It's unpleasant and
needs to be repeated.

This suggests
some sort of

invasive medical test,
like perhaps a colonoscopy.

Aren't there any
other options?

There's not a lot of room.

It's gonna be uncomfortable.

Yes, yes.

I'm definitely going
with colonoscopy.

Okay, bye.

My mother's coming to visit.

How about that,
you were right.



It's out of order.

Yes, I can read the sign.

I'm just pondering
the implications.

I think it implies that
the elevator doesn't work.

Again, I can read the sign.

But the sign and the tape are
coated with a layer of dust,

which indicates that the
elevator has been nonfunctional

for a significant
amount of time.

Which suggests either
a remarkable passivity

among the, I assume,

24 to 36 residents
of this building,

based on the number of mailboxes

and given typical
urban population density

or a shared delusion
of functionality.

You must be Leonard's mother.

Oh, I don't know
if I must be, but yes.

Uh, I'm Penny.
I'm his neighbor.

Oh, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter.

Oh, nice to
meet you.

Oh, you're a hand shaker.

Interesting.

Uh, why don't you
come with me.

I'll walk you to the apartment.
Oh, all right.

Would you like to exchange
pleasantries on the way?

Yeah, sure, I guess.

All right, you start.

Okay.

You know,
I've always been curious.

What was Leonard like
when he was little?

Oh, I think
you mean young.

He's always
been little.

Right, okay.

What was he like
when he was young?

You'll have to be
more specific.

Um, okay, like,
five or six.

Five.

Oh, well, at that age,
he was well enmeshed

in what Freud would call
the phallic stage

of psychosexual development.

An outmoded theory, of
course, but the boy did spend

most of his waking hours with
a tight grasp on his penis.

Yeah, Leonard mentioned
you were a psychiatrist.

Well, that is
one of my degrees.

My primary field
is neuroscience.

Well, I'm an actress.

Why?

What do you mean why?

Well, there are studies that
suggest that many who go into

the performing arts suffer from
an external locus of identity.

Yeah, I don't know
what that means.

Well, it means
you value yourself

only as others value you,

which is often the result of
unmet childhood emotional needs.

Oh, well, I had a
wonderful childhood.

Tell me about it.

I know my dad
wanted a boy.

I just, I tried
being good at sports,

but I hated
getting dirty!

And then, I'm assuming,
you entered adolescence.

He called me Slugger until
I got my first training bra.

And then he just stopped
playing catch with me.

I wasn't Slugger anymore.

Your mother's here!

If you want to have intercourse
with that girl,

find out what kind of cologne
her father wore.

Good to see you, Mother.

Here's your
tea, Mother.

Oolong?
Yes.

Loose, not bagged?
Yes.

Steeped three minutes?
Yes.

Two-percent milk?
Yes.

Warmed separately?
Yes.

One teaspoon sugar?
Yes.

Raw sugar?
Yes.

It's cold.

I'll start again.

I have the same problem with him.

My theory is that
his lack of focus

stems from an over-
developed sex drive.

Oh, I don't know
where he would've gotten that.

Aside from a pro forma
consummation of our marriage,

his father and I
only had intercourse

for the purposes
of reproduction.

That seems a fairly efficient
arrangement.

Yes, we think so.

We've both done papers on it.

Mine from the neuroscientific
point of view

and his from an anthropological.

Mine, of course,
was the only one worth reading.

Of course.

I would very much like to read
about your sex life.

Well, it's all online
or you can order it

from the Princeton
University Press.

Here's your
tea, Mother.

So, what are you guys
talking about?

The frequency with which
your parents had intercourse.

Swell.

If you're lucky,
maybe she'll show you

the PowerPoint presentation.

I'm sorry,
it's on my other laptop.

Aw...

So, Mother...

what's new?

You'll have to be more specific.

All right.

Uh, what's new with you?

Oh, well, I've been having

some fascinating
menopausal symptoms recently.

Maybe something less personal.

Oh.

Your Uncle Floyd died.

Oh, my God.

What happened?

His heart stopped beating.

I have to urinate.

What a remarkable woman.

Yeah, I-I thought you guys
might hit it off.

I envy you your childhood.

I hate to tell you,
but the only warm memories

I have of my childhood
are of my Uncle Floyd.

You're clearly misremembering.

Your mother is brilliant,

analytical,
insightful.

And I'm betting
she never hit you

with a Bible because

you wouldn't eat
your Brussels sprouts.

Sheldon, you don't give
your mother enough credit.

She's warm, she's loving,

she doesn't glue electrodes
to your head

to measure your brain waves
while potty training.

You were lucky.

When I was a kid,
if I wanted an EEG,

I had to attach
my own electrodes.

So, Dr. Hofstadter,

Leonard rarely talks about

his incredibly successful
brother and sister.

Please, don't go
there, Howard.

I understand that,

unlike Leonard,
they're at the top

of their respective fields.

Boy, you suck.

Well, Leonard's younger brother,
Michael,

is a tenured law professor
at Harvard,

and his sister just
successfully grew

a human pancreas
in an adolescent gibbon.

So, she's close
to curing diabetes?

Why else would you grow
a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?

Wow, you must be very proud.

Why?

They're not my accomplishments.

I have to urinate.

Why are you doing this?

You know the rules.

You brought your mom to work...
you must suffer.

Leonard, I had no idea

your siblings were so much more
successful than you.

Yeah, you're like the Jar Jar
Binks of the Hofstadter family.

Oh, meesa think

yousa lookin' so so sad.

You know, rather than mock me,
my friends might realize

that this is difficult
and try to help me through it.

Nope, I think mocking you
is more fun.

Next time, don't yousa
bring mama to work.

Okee-day?

That was fast.

Oh, the middle stall
was occupied.

I'll have to try again later.

That's totally understandable.

In bladder voiding,
as in real estate,

it's location,
location, location.

So, where were we?

Howard lives with his mother
and Raj can't speak to women

unless he's drunk.

Go.

That's fascinating.

Selective mutism is quite rare.

On the other hand,
an adult Jewish male

living with his mother
is so common

it borders on
sociological clich�.

It's just temporary;
I pay rent.

He lives in the same room
where his bassinet was.

You know, both
selective mutism

and an inability
to separate from one's mother

can stem from
a pathological fear of women.

It might
explain why

the two of you have created
an ersatz homosexual marriage

to satisfy your need
for intimacy.

Say what?

That's basically
what I just said.

You brought your husband
to work.

You know the rules.

Meesa thinking yousa
looking pretty sad now
too, betcha, betcha.

Leonard, it's 1:00.

Weren't you going to show me
your laboratory at 1:00?

There's no hurry, Mother.

Tell them more about their
secret love for each other.

But it's 1:00.

You were going to show me
your laboratory at 1:00.

Her reasoning is
unassailable.

It is 1:00.

Fine. Let's go.

I think you'll find my
work pretty interesting.

I'm attempting to replicate
the dark matter signal

found in sodium iodide
crystals by the Italians.

So, no original research?

No.

Well, what's the point
of my seeing it?

I could just read the paper
the Italians wrote.

Just for the record,

we're not in an ersatz
homosexual relationship.

Well, then why didn't
you say that to her?

Why is it always my
responsibility?

It's not always
your responsibility.

I swear, this is the
same thing you did

at the comic book store
last week.

I can't believe you're
bringing that up.

I didn't bring it up.
You did.

We'll talk about
this later.

You always say that,
but we never do.

You went to the comic book
store without me.

Hey.

You got alcohol?

Your mom still here?
Yep.

Come on in.

Wait, wait, she's not gonna come
here looking for you, is she?

Relax. She took Sheldon to the
hospital to get a brain scan.

Oh, my God. What happened?

Nothing. Mother likes
looking at brains

and Sheldon likes getting
his brain scanned.

Geez, what a fun couple.

She's only been here
a day and a half

and I'm seriously
considering alcoholism

as a new career path.

Hey, I talked to her
for five minutes yesterday

and I've been
half bombed ever since.

You can't let her
get into your head.

My head, what about yours?

It's too late for me.

My head is her summer house.

She was right, you know.

The locus of my identity
is totally exterior to me.

Oh, yeah, there
she is. Hi, Mom.

I mean, do you know where
I was all morning?

Auditioning
with 50 other blondes

for some stupid
antidepressant commercial.

And for what?

So I'll finally get
my daddy's approval?

Did you get the part?

No, they said I was too perky.

You want to talk about not
getting love from a parent.

You know what I used to
do when I was little

to have some sensation
of human contact?

Yeah, you grabbed your
penis and wouldn't let go.

Your mother told me.

Of course she did.

Anyway, that's not
what I was gonna say.

When I was ten years old,

I built a hugging machine.

A hugging machine?

Yeah. I got a
dressmaker's mannequin,

I stuffed it with
an electric blanket

so it would be warm, and built
two radio-controlled arms

that would hug me
and pat my back.

Oh, that is so sad.

You know what the
saddest part was?
What?

My father used to borrow it.

Your scan data will be very
helpful to my research.

You have a remarkable brain.

I know.

Although I've always hated

how my right frontal lobe
looks in pictures.

Common complaint among men.

Nothing's ever big enough.

Except when they get a tumor.

Then you never hear
the end of it.

I'd love to see a scan
of your brain sometime.

Oh, I'll send you a link,

but its physiology
is fairly unimpressive.

Oh, I can't believe that.

Your unwillingness to accept
empirical evidence

suggests an attempt
at flattery.

My apologies.

I've been living
with your son too long.

Gotten into some bad habits.

Understandable.

Can I make you a cup of tea?
I doubt it,

but if anyone has a chance,
it's probably you.

I feel very comfortable
around you.

I feel very comfortable
around you, too.

It's surprising

because I generally
don't feel comfortable around,

well, anyone.

Nor I.

What are the odds
that two individuals

as unique as ourselves
would be connected

by someone as comparatively
workaday as your son?

Is that a rhetorical point

or would you like to do
the math?

I'd like to do the math.

I'd like that, too.

Okay, now this time,
Uh-huh.

you're gonna lick
the salt...

off my neck...

do the shot...

and then bite the lime.

I'm sorry, I didn't hear
anything after "lick."

Neck, shot, lime.

Okay, shot, lime.

Right.

Ah!

Where's the lime?

Oh, okay, we're sharing.

So, what do you think?

I'm very tempted.

I'm just not sure
it's appropriate

with my son's roommate.

Normally, I'd feel
the same way.

But based on everything
I've observed about us,

I can't help but speculate
we'd be very good together.

True. I've had
a similar observation.

It's certainly something

I could never do
with my husband.

I was hesitant the
first time I tried it,

but I experienced
an unanticipated

and remarkable release
of endorphins.

It's quite satisfying.

I see what you're doing.

You're appealing

to the neuroscientific
researcher in me.

You see right through
me, don't you?

Only when you're in
a CAT scanner.

This is actually
gonna happen.

Honey, shush, shush,
shush, shush, shush.

You shush, I'm happy.
I want to talk about it.

You know what my mother
would say about this?

She would say because you were
not loved by your father

and I was not loved
by my mother,

that having sex is our way
of making up for the intimacy

we didn't get as children.

Why would you bring
that up right now?

I don't know.

Foreplay?

So you're saying

you're not having
sex with me,

you're having sex
with your mother?

I'm gonna go with "no."

That is the sickest
thing I've ever heard.

Come on, you're trying

to have sex with your father,
and I'm okay with that.

Get out!

She said shush.
I should have shushed.

Ooh, all night, all night

Oh, every night

Hold tight
Hold tight

You hold tight
Hold tight

Baby, hold tight

Anyway you want it,
that's the way you need it

All right, Mother.

Um, have a nice flight.

That's not really in my control,
is it?

Oh, uh, yes.

Oh, good morning.

Morning.

Look, I was just coming
over to talk to you.

You don't have to.

Ever.

Gotcha.

Good-bye, Mother.

Good-bye, Leonard.

So, Slugger,
shall we pick up

where we left
off last time?

I mean, my mom
could've just said,

"Bob, get over it,
she's a girl, move on."

But she didn't.

Not one word.
Interesting.

Would you be willing to fly
to New Jersey and discuss

your relationship with your
parents during a brain scan?

Would it help?
Well, it would help me.


Sheldon, you're wrong.

Wolverine was not born
with bone claws.

Howard, you know me to be
a very smart man.

Don't you think if I were wrong,
I'd know it?

 First of all...
 Give it up.

You're arguing with a crazy person.

I'm not crazy.
My mother had me tested.

 Hey, guys.
 What are you doing here?

What? It's new-comic-book night.

Since you and Penny hooked up...

we thought you two would be having
bouncy naked yum-yum night.

There's more to life than sex, Raj.

Who had Leonard flames out
in 24 hours?

I did.

Nothing flamed out.

We don't have to have sex
every night.

You don't have to,
but it's highly recommended.

Take advantage
of that window of opportunity...

before it slams shut
on your little dinky.

It's not a matter of opportunity.

We're getting to know each other.
There's a learning curve.

What's to learn?
You get naked, do nasty things.

Then somebody makes scrambled eggs
and salami. Easy-peasy.

Perhaps what Leonard
is obliquely referring to...

is the occurrence
of sexual dysfunction.

Okay, who had
Leonard gets a floppy disk?

Oh. A clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism
for insufficient blood flow...

to the male sex organ.

Nothing like that happened, all right?
The sex was just fine.

Just fine?

Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Pottermovie
was just fine.

I'm not saying it was bad.
I'm just saying it wasn't great.

Okay, you mean for both of you?

Because we can totally see it
not being great for her. Am I right?

To tell you the truth, I think
we were both a little... I don't know...

 Disappointed? Let down?
 Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?

All I know is
it wasn't the way I dreamed it would be.

Sex is never the way
I dream it's gonna be.

That's because in your dreams,
you're a horse from the waist down.

Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin
Miniseries Issue 2, page 22.

Retractable bone claws.

If you spent less time thinking about sex
and more time on comic books...

we'd have far fewer
of these embarrassing moments.

Sheldon, dinner's here.

Tandoori Palace?

No, we went somewhere new.

You're good-naturedly ribbing me,
aren't you?

No, look, Mumbai Palace.

Why? Why would we change?

We had a perfectly good palace.
Tandoori Palace is our palace.

Trust me, this will be just fine.

You are the authority on just fine.

What's that supposed to mean?

Exactly. Not bad, but not great.

 What are they talking about?
 I don't know.

 I know. As I'm sure you're aware...
 Dut! Dut-dut-dut-dut!

If that's Morse code, that's terrible.

As I was saying, you and Leonard
had a disappointing sexual encounter.

Earlier this evening,
Leonard characterized it as, "Just fine."

So, what you're seeing is a continuation
of the mocking that followed.

Okay. Yeah, well, I'm just gonna go eat
my dinner elsewhere.

Maybe an airplane headed
for a mountainside.

Penny, wait. Aah.

What is wrong with you?

I sense I may have crossed
some sort of line.

 Yeah, you...
 Don't tell him.

Let's see if he can figure it out.

 Ugh. I am so embarrassed.
 Please don't be mad.

 What did you tell them?
 Nothing bad.

Just that last night was fine.

Fine? You said it was fine?

Yeah. It's a perfectly good word.

You put it in front of "wine" or "dining"
and you've really got something.

Okay, well, let me ask you this,
how was last night for you?

It was...

okay.

Okay?

Yeah, it's a perfectly good word.

I mean, you put it in front of "dokay"
and you really got something.

All right, let's not overreact.

It takes time
to get to know each other's rhythms.

Learn what the other person wants
and likes.

 So you've been through this before?
 No.

Okay-dokay.

This is one of those things where talking
about it is not gonna make it better.

 Want a glass of wine? Okay.
 So much.

See, we should've done this last night,
you know?

Had a little wine, take the edge off.

Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits
electrical conduction in the nerve cells...

and stimulates reuptake receptors
of inhibitory neurotransmitters...

like gamma-aminobutyric acid.

Don't talk. Just drink.

No, you're misunderstanding.

A shiksa goddess
isn't an actual goddess.

We don't pray to them.
We prey on them.

Whatever, dude. The point is
Leonard's got one and you don't.

Is this it?

It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard
and Penny's sex life...

in front of Leonard and Penny.

Good.

Now I can eat.

 What's that?
 Sounds like a cricket.

Hang on.

Based on the number of chirps
per minute and the temperature...

it is a snowy tree cricket.

Oh. Give me a fricking break.
How could you possibly know that?

In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined
there was a fixed relationship...

between the number of chirps per
minute and the ambient temperature.

A precise relationship that is not present
with ordinary field crickets.

How do you know the temperature
of this room?

Under the terms of my roommate
agreement I've had control...

of the thermostat
ever since the sweaty night of '06.

Okay, you were right about Wolverine
and bone claws...

but you're wrong about the cricket.

Howard, don't embarrass yourself.
The science chirps for itself.

Humorous word play.

No, no. Not this time.
I know insects, my friend.

I spent many childhood years capturing
them with nets, putting them in jars...

sticking pins through them, mounting
them on cardboard with labels...

identifying the genus and species.

In Latin.

Oh. Dude, you are never getting
a shiksa goddess.

That is a snowy tree cricket.
Oecanthus fultoni.

I was done with Latin by fifth grade.

Okay. Tell you what.

I am willing to bet anything
that's an ordinary field cricket.

 I can't take your money.
 What's the matter, you chicken?

I've always found that
an inappropriate slur.

Chickens are not at all timid.

In fact, when I was young,
my neighbor's chicken got loose...

and chased me up the big elm tree
in front of our house.

 Chickens can't climb trees.
 Thank God.

Okay, I believe a chicken made you
his bitch.

The cricket thing, I don't buy. Bet me.

Fair enough.

What stakes do you propose?

I will put up
my Fantastic Four Number 48...

first appearance of Silver Surfer...

against your Flash 123,
the classic "Flash of Two Worlds" issue.

All right, you have a wager.

Hmm.

Great.
Now, how are you gonna settle it? Hmm?

There is no way to determine the species
of the cricket without examining it.

I wonder what the non-pathetic people
are doing tonight.

 More wine?
 Hit me.

 I don't see anything.
 Shh.

Hallway.

Ahh.

One at a time.

What was that?

My stomach.

Indian food doesn't agree with me.

Ironic, isn't it?

Elevator shaft.

Help me open it.

Are you crazy? We can't go down
an empty elevator shaft.

If you don't wanna proceed,
then you forfeit the bet...

and I'll take possession
of your Fantastic Four.

Let's open her up.

Are you bothered
that I can so easily manipulate you?

Don't push me, Sheldon.

I may be small,
but I took kung fu when I was 13...

and I remember a good deal of it.

Oh, really?

I grew up with an older brother
and a very contentious twin sister.

And I could easily best you
in any physical confrontation.

Be it noogies, swirlies or the classic,
"Why are you hitting yourself?"

Ooh. Big talk from a man who was once
treed by a chicken.

 Ahem.
 What are we drinking now?

Peppermint schnapps.

Why would you
buy peppermint schnapps?

Because I like peppermint
and it's fun to say "schnapps."

 Hey, Leonard?
 What?

Schnapps.

Schnapps.

You're right, that is fun.

Be careful.

If I were not being careful...

your telling me to be careful
would not make me careful.

Stairwell.

Uh-oh. Flashlight went out.
I need some batteries.

Fellas?

Hello?

It's really dark down here.

Oh, sweetie, you really can't hold
your liquor, can you?

I'm okay.

Just a little mouthwash
and then I'm gonna rock your world.

Are you okay?

Oh. Toby, what did you do in a past life
to be so disgusting now?

His name isn't Toby.

Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.

 What would you name him?
 An appropriate cricket name.

For example, Jiminy.

All right, Sheldon, here we go.

Kleingast's Field Guide
to North American Insects.

Hey, Toby.

Right here.

See it? "The common field cricket,
a.k.a. Gryllus assimilis"...

which is Latin for "suck it, you lose."

Hang on.

Voil�. "The snowy tree cricket,
a.k.a. Oecanthus fultoni"...

which is Latin for "I'll suck nothing."

Of course, I'm joking, because the Latin
for that is "nihil exsorbibo."

That is not Toby, this is Toby.

Raj, what do you think?

Oh. I really don't care anymore.

 God, I had the most horrible night.
 What happened?

Obviously another carnal fiasco
with the "shiksi" goddess.

Shiksa. Shiksa.

Forgive me.
Yiddish was not spoken in East Texas.

And if it was,
it wasn't spoken for long.

Yeah, fine, whatever.
The point is you're wrong, again.

We haven't established
that I'm wrong once.

Let's go down
to the Entomology Department...

and let Professor Crawley tell us
what kind of cricket Toby is.

He's a snowy tree cricket.
And his name is Jiminy.

I bet I could throw a rock in this room
and come up with three better friends.

Holy crap.

It's like Silence of the Lambs
down here.

Don't do that.

Don't be such a girl. They're just bugs.

I don't like bugs, okay?
They freak me out.

Interesting.

You're afraid of insects and women.

Ladybugs must render you catatonic.

It was a joke.

I made it to lessen your discomfort.

You're welcome.

Ha-ha. Don't knock. Just walk in.

Why be polite to the world's leading
expert on the dung beetle?

Excuse me,
are you Professor Crawley?

Who wants to know?

I'm Dr. Cooper,
from the Physics Department.

 Couldn't wait, huh?
 I'm sorry?

I haven't even packed yet
and you're already measuring my lab...

for one
of your godless laser machines.

No, you don't understand.
We just wanna ask you a question.

Let me ask you one first.

What's a world-renowned entomologist
with a doctorate...

and 20 years of experience,
to do with his life...

when the university cuts off
the funding for his lab, huh?

Ask rhetorical questions
that make people uncomfortable?

What's your deal?

Are they planning to outsource my job
to Bangalore?

I'm from New Delhi.

 We should find another entomologist.
 We're here. Let's settle this.

Professor,
can you identify our cricket?

Of course I can.

I can identify every insect
and arachnid on the planet.

Not that that's gonna keep me from
having to move in with my daughter...

in Oxnard. And we're not talking
Oxnard at the beach. No.

We're talking Oxnard
in the onion fields.

 Well, could you look at Toby?
 Toby?

What a stupid name for a cricket.

Told you.

It's a field cricket.

 Yes.
 No, wait.

Dr. Crawley, are you sure?

Young man, I've been studying insects
since I was 8 years old.

You know what they used to call me
in school?

Creepy Crawley.

Cruel as that may be,
that is not in itself a credential.

Let me show you something.

See that?
That's a Crawley's dung beetle.

I discovered it after spending
six months...

slogging through
the Bornean rain forests...

while my wife was back home...

shacking up
with a two-bit ornithologist...

who lives on a sailboat
and likes to wear boot-cut jeans.

So when I tell you
that that's a common field cricket...

you can take that
to the damn bank.

Because God knows I can't.

That tramp took me for everything.

Well, apparently I was wrong.

Congratulations.

Enjoy Oxnard.

I'm sure your daughter's looking forward
to having you.

Oh, hey, Sheldon.
What you got there? New comic book?

Old comic book.

I just retrieved it
from my safe-deposit box.

What do you have
a safe-deposit box for?

Old comic books.

I lost this to Wolowitz
in an ill-considered cricket wager.

What, do they have Wii cricket now?

That can't be very popular.

Penny, I'd rather not talk about it.

Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'm not feeling so hot either.

Why would that make me feel better?

I don't know, empathy?

I'm just saying that you're feeling upset
about something with Howard...

and I'm upset about something
with Leonard.

Yes, the disappointing sex.

That's an inexact parallel.

You and Leonard can always return
to being friends.

I can never return to a state
in which Wolowitz has not bested me...

like Mrs. Riley's chicken.

What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?

A chicken that was owned
by Mrs. Riley.

 Okay, forget the chicken.
 I wish I could.

No, no.
You may be right about me and Leonard.

Well, of course I'm right. What are the
odds I'd be wrong twice in one week?

No, I mean,
we can always go back to being friends.

I just said that... This conversation
has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.

 Hello.
 Hey.

What's going on?

Oh, you'd like to catch up
on the events of the day. All right.

Well, there was a half-hour wait at the
bank to get into my safe-deposit box.

I was forced to talk to Penny
about your sexual problems.

And, oh, yes, in a moment filled
with biblical resonance...

pride wenteth before my fall...

causing my Flash 123
to goeth to Wolowitz.

Wait a minute.
You talked to Penny about our sex life?

Leonard, it astonishes me
how you continually fixate on the trivial.

I lost a bet to Wolowitz.

 You're saying you talked to Penny?
 Yes.

 Interesting.
 Hardly.

Excuse me.

Have I crossed
some sort of line again?

Little bit.

Hmm.

Oh. Who cares?

 Oh, hey.
 Hey, what did Sheldon say to you?

Not a lot. That we always have the
option of going back to being friends.

 Is that what you want?
 I don't know.

I mean, you have to admit...

things seemed simpler
when we were just friends.

I guess.

 It would take the pressure off.
 It would, wouldn't it?

So we'll just be friends.

Good. Good.

Come here.

Okay-dokay.



That was close.

God, I love the smell of
paintballs in the morning.

Yeah, still funny, Raj.

There's no way we can get to the ridge.

The Chemistry Department
has us completely cut off.

But what about the creek bed?

The Pharmacology Department controls that, and
they're all hopped up on experimental steroids.

That's it then. We're doomed.

I think the time has come to acknowledge
that we are paying the price for some of us

failing to attend my Physics
Department paintball strategy meeting.

I told you my mom has spider veins.

I had to take her to the laser clinic.

And I told you I wante
to see a doctor's note.

We need a plan.

How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?

I forget. Which one
is Hammer of the Gods?

We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking
lot and ambush people when they come to pee.

No go. The Dumpsters are deep in
Astronomy Department territory.

That shouldn't be a problem.
Venus is up during the day.

They're probably just
all staring at the sky.

All right, what we need
now is a tactical retreat.

Did you see the episode of Stargate
where they found themselves on a planet

with a culture based loosely
on Earth's Athens and Sparta?

Not important.

Leonard, Raj and I are going to
burst out the door and run away.

Howard will cover us.

Why don't I run away and you cover me?

Because you chose your
mother's veins over victory.

On three. One, two, three, go!

I had to take her! It's
almost bathing suit weather!

I surrender! Don't
shoot! They went that way!

Howard, I'm on your team.

Oh, Leslie, thank God.

Where's the rest of your squad?

Ah, they left me here to die.

What about yours?

Dead, all of them.

Sorry.

Don't be. It was friendly fire.

They just wouldn't listen.

Well, we're surrounded, so I
guess there's nothing for us to do

but wait to be captured or killed.

Hmm, that's the worst part, the waiting.

All the while knowing that there's a
paint pellet out there with your namen it.

Yeah, the big wet ball of death.

Kind of makes you feel
more alive, doesn't it?

It kind of does.

I say we make every moment count.

I agree.

How exactly do we do that?

Howard, why aren't you covering us?
We're getting slaughtered out here!

War is hell.




Did you guys see the new budget
memo that went out this morning?

Yeah, more cutbacks.

Unacceptable.It baffles me why
they don't simply let some of you go

so that there's money
available for my research.

You know what baffles me, Sheldon?

Based on your academic record,
any number of things, I imagine.

 Hey, guys.
 Hey, Leslie.

Howard, I got the approval for
the rapid prototyper you wanted.

That's great, Leslie. Thanks.

You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

What was all that about?

Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie
control of some unrestricted grant money.

Yeah, okay, but what's with the back
 scratching and the meow!

I believe the back-scratching metaphor
generally describes a quid p quo situation

where one party provides goods or services to the
second party in compensation for a similar action.

Thank you.

The meow, that sounded to
me like an African civet cat.

Are you done?

No.

Despite what the name suggests,
the civet cat is not a true cat.

Now I'm done.

You know what I'm thinking?

I'm thinking Howard wasn't
making a back-scratching metaphor.

I'm thinking there was some
actual scratching involved.

What about it, Howard?

Okay, I didn't want to say anything 'cause
I know you and Leslie have a little history.

I don't care about that.

Great, 'cause I've been
dying to say something.

You and Leslie?

In the paintball shed! Twice!

Is that why you didn't cover our escape
and let us get cut down like animals?

Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

My good man, dereliction of duty in the
face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.

Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle
is the fifth girl I've ever had sex with.

I mean, for free.

And plus, you got a rapid prototyper.

That's an expensive
piece of equipment, dude.

And the rest of us have had
our budgets cut to the bone.

Okay, one way to look at this is
that I'm getting new equipment,

and you're not, and that's unfair.

But a better way to look at this is that I'm
getting sex and you're not, and that's delightful.

The whole thing froze. I
don't know what happened.

Calm down. We'll figure it out.

How can I calm down? I'm gonna
lose my whole shopping cart.

That's three hours of picking
out shoes just shot to hell.

 Hello, Penny.
 Hello, Sheldon.

You're in my spot.

Are you planning on sitting here?

No, I'm going to the comic book store.

Then what difference does it make?

 What difference does it make?
 Here we go.

That is my spot.

In an ever-changing world, it
is a single point of consistency.

If my life were expressed as a function on a
four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system,

that spot at the moment I first sat
on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.

What?

Don't sit in his spot.

Fine. Happy?

I'm not unhappy.

Boy, I love him, but he
is one serious waadoodle.

Okay, that should do it.

Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.

That's a lot of shoes you ordered.

Yeah, you know the sad
thing is, it's really not.

Ooh, is thisne of those paintball guns?

Yeah. You ought to come
out with us sometime.

Oh, no, thanks. I'm from Nebraska.

When we shoot things, it's because we want to
eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone.

Boy, your heart's racing. I
must've really gotten you going.

Well, it's partly you, partly
my transient idiopaic arrhythmia.

Sexy.

Can I assume that you likewise
found the experience...

Satisfactory?

That wasn't quite the word I was looking
for, but sure, I'll do this pass-fail.

Hey, are you enjoying
that prototyper I got you?

Oh, it's great.

Everybody in the Engineering
Department is eating their hearts out.

Isn't it nice when your good
fortune makes others miserable?

You know, most people don't get that.

Howard, I'm home!

Oh, great.

Book club was cancelled!

That thing on Phyllis's
neck opened up again!

I'm busy, Ma!

Too busy to help your
mother with her zipper?

Don't come in, Ma!

Why not?

He's got company!

Oh, there's the arrhythmia.

Is she Jewish?

 Are you Jewish?
 No.

Yes!

Okay, then you kids have fun!

Use protection!

You think he'll notice?

There's a chance.

Oh, what are we gonna do?

We?

No, no, you had your chance to be
"we" for, like, a year and a half now.

Right now, you are "you,"
and you are screwed.

Why do we have to tell him I did it?

Well, we're not gonna tell him I did it.

Okay, okay, how about this?

We tell him somebody broke in.

Just to shoot the couch
with a paintball gun?

I'm sorry, Iuy it. All
those people are on drugs.

We could him they wanted the couch
to stay away from their boyfriend.

Okay, fine. What if
we just flip it over?

There. Looks fine, right?

Mm, butt print. There's
no discernible butt print.

Oh, come on.

There, butt print.

It's too small and too... perfect.

 Thank you.
 You're welcome.

Act normal.

Sheldon!

How was the comic book store?

Fine. e new issue of Flash is out.

Great, great. Did you walk the
whole way? It's a little chilly.

Koothrappali picked me up.

Isn't that terrific?

He is such a good friend.

You know what the best
thing about friends is?

They don't talk incessantly
for no particular reason.

No, no, friends forgive
the little things.

You know, I gotta go
home and wash my hair.

Don't you dare, missy.

Hello, fastest man alive.

Want to see me read
your entire comic book?

Want to see it again?

Something's wrong.

What do you mean?

I'm not sure.

It doesn't feel right.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Oh, that. Penny did that.

Excuse me.

Why don't you just
eat in your desk chair?

Why don't I just eat in my desk chair?

Here we go.

That is my desk chair.
That is where I work.

I don't eat in my desk chair
and I don't work in my spot.

I work in my desk chair
and eat in my spot.

Wackadoodle.

You know, there's kind of an
obvious solution here. Get up.

There. Problem solved.

Nobody cares where you're
going to sit. You're not crazy.

Excuse me, but the
problem is not solved.

If your head had been accidentally amputated,
and we transplanted a dog's head in its place,

would that be "problem solved"?

If it were your head, it would be.

Sheldon, I am really, really
sorry, but it's only for a week.

Can't you be a little bit flexible?

Yeah, sorry. I didn't
really think that through.

You claimed it's going to be a week,
but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.

Why not?

Did you notice the sign on his counter?

He's not a full-time dry cleaner.

He also makes keys.

Oh, for God's sake, Sheldon.

Focus is important.

Was Michael DeBakey a wedding
planner in between heart transplants?

Did Alexander Fleming
moonlight as a hairdresser?

"Thanks for discovering penicillin.
Now how about we try a bouffant?"

Ooh, looks like I'm
gonna have sex tonight.

Hey, baby...

His right hand is calling him?

No, it's Leslie Winkle.
It's a long story.

I'll pick you up in ten minutes.

Gentlemen, adieu.

I thought we were going
to play Halo tonight.

What am I supposed to do, Leonard?

There's a woman out there
anxious to have sex with me.

You understand, right?

No. Not at all.

Nevertheless, I must depart.

By the way, did I tell you?

Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research
trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.

That's not fair. You're
not even a physicist.

Okay, there are two ways
of looking at this...

 Get out.
 Bye.

You're improving.

Thank you. It helps when I get
to practice with a real woman.

Hey, listen. Saturday my
sister's getting married.

I-I want you to come
with me. It's black tie.

Yeah, gee, I'd really rather not.

Why not?

When I go to weddings, it's
to scam on chunky bridesmaids.

I don't know what I
would do with a date.

Oh, all right. I understand.

Thanks.

Hey, I'm really sorry
about that Geneva trip.

What about it?

Oh, didn't you hear?

I had to reduce the number of people
going, and you didn't make the cut.

When did that haen?

About 12 seconds ago.

Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don't
go to the wedding, I can't go to Geneva?

Actually, I'm trying not to say it.

Okay, I'm sorry, but that
makes me a little uncomfortable.

How so?

Because it's like you're controlling me
with new equipment and research trips.

Well, if I weren't controlling you with new equipment
and research trips, then I'd be uncomfortable.

How so?

'Cause then we'd be in, like, a real
relationship with feelings and all that crap.

So, bottom line, I'm just a
bought-and-paid-for sex toy.

No. No, noat all. You're also arm candy.

So? What do you think?

Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!

Right now?

What kind of sex are
you having up there?

Why are you crouching there?

This is my spot.

Where else am I supposed to crouch?

I don't know. Texas?

Here you go. Fresh from
the cleaners, good as new.

Really? Great. Sheldon,
look. Good as new.

From that key maker, I highly doubt it.

Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.

All right.

There, nice and comfy
cozy. Zero, zero, zero.

There's one more zero.

You forgot the time parameter.

Sit on the damn couch.

Nope.

What do you mean, "nope"?
What's wrong with it?

Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.

 It's exactly the same...
 Penny, Penny,

I think I know what to do.

Sheldon, I have some bad news.

More?

I'm afraid so.

You know the cashew chicken
I get you Monday nights?

Yes. From Szechuan Palace.

Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.

What? Whe did my cashew
chicken come from?

Golden Dragon.

No.

No, this isn't right.

Our food always comes in
Szechuan Palace containers.

Yeah, well, before they went out of
business, I bought 4,000 containers.

I keep them in the trunk of my car.

But... Oh, this changes everything.

I thought that might take
his mind off the cushion.

What's real? What isn't? How can I know?

You did make that up, right?

Oh, God, I wish I had.

 Leonard?
 Yeah, buddy?

I still don't like this cushion.

ll, Penny, thank you for coming.

Thanks for the shoes.

Penny is an amazing shot. I think we
have a real chance to win this week.

 What's the plan?
 Okay. Now, we all run out.

Sheldon and I will cut to
the left behind these trees.

Raj, Howard and Leslie flank
to the right behind the rocks.

Then we'll all have a great view as Penny
runs out and kills everyone else in sight.

Just one thing before we start.

What is it, Sheldon?

What the hell?

That was for my cushion.

Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.

I'm sorry, Leonard. But revenge
is a dish best served cold.

Screw that.

She can't shoot me. She's dead.

He's right. You can't.

Well, if we're going to
descend into anarchy...

Okay, see you.

Where are you going?

Surrender, then Denny's.




 Checkmate.
 Aaarggh!

Again?

Obviously, you're not well suited
for three-dimensional chess.

Perhaps three-dimensional Candy Land
would be more your speed.

Just reset the board.

It must be humbling to suck
on so many different levels.


 Hey, guys.
 Hey.

 Get my mail?
 Yeah, right here.

 How was Nebraska?
 Well, better than North Dakota.

I guess that joke's only funny
in Nebraska.

From the data at hand,
you can't draw that conclusion.

All you can say with absolute certainty
is that that joke is not funny here.

Boy, it's good to be back.

 How's your family?
 Oh, it was the worst trip.

 Everyone got sick over the weekend.
 Sick?

Here we go.

 What kind of sick?
 Oh, the flu, I guess.

I don't need you to guess,
I need you to know.

Now, when did the symptoms
first appear?

Maybe Friday.

Friday. Was that morning or afternoon?

 I don't...
 Think, woman.

Who blew their nose and when?

Sheldon, relax.
She doesn't have any symptoms.

I'm sure she's not contagious.

Oh, please.

If influenza was only contagious
after symptoms appear...

it would've died out years ago.

Somewhere between tool using
and cave painting...

Homo habilis would've figured out
to kill the guy with the runny nose.

Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon.
He's a bit of a germaphobe.

That's okay. I understand.

Thanks for your consideration.
Now please leave.

You'd better go
before he starts spraying you with Lysol.

Okay, well,
thank you for getting my mail.

No, problem. Welcome home.


What?

What the hell are you doing?

I'm making petri dishes
to grow throat cultures.

With lime Jell-O?

I need a growth medium, and someone
polished off the apricot yogurt.

Here. Swab my throat.

 I don't think so.
 Leonard.

If I'm going to get ahead of this, I need
to find out what's growing in my throat.

Sheldon, you are not sick.

This is, but you are not.

We have no idea what pathogen...

Typhoid Penny
has introduced into our environment.

And having never been to Nebraska, I'm
certain I have no corn-husking antibodies.

Sheldon, don't you think
you're overreacting?

When I'm lying comatose in a hospital
relying on inferior minds to cure me...

these cultures
and my accompanying notes...

will give them a fighting chance.

I'm going back to bed.

 Wait, put this in the bathroom.
 What for?

I need to measure
my fluid intake and output...

to make sure
my kidneys aren't shutting down.

I mix pancake batter in this.

No, that measuring cup
has always been for urine.

You had time to make a label
for everything in this apartment...

including the label-maker...

but you didn't have 10 seconds
to make one that said, "Urine cup"?

It's right here on the bottom.

Huh.

I guess I owe the Betty Crocker Company
a letter of apology.


Oh, dear God.

Leonard.

Leonard, I'm sick.

Leonard.


Leonard, I'm sick.

Leonard.

Leonard.

Leonard.

Leonard, my comforter fell down
and my sinuses hurt when I bend over.

Leonard?

Ow.

 Leonard, where are you?

I'm at work.

At 6:30 in the morning?

Yes.

On Sunday?

Yes.

 Why?
 They asked me to come in.

 Well, I didn't hear the phone ring.
 They texted me.

Well, as I predicted, I am sick.

My fever has been tracking up
exponentially since 2a. m...

and I am producing sputum
at an alarming rate.


 No kidding.
 Nope. Not only that...

it has shifted from clear
to milky green.

All right, well, get some rest
and drink plenty of fluids.

What else would I drink?
Gases? Solids? Ionized plasma?

Drink whatever you want.

 I want soup.
 Then make soup.

 We don't have soup.
 I'm at work, Sheldon.


 Is that a dog?
 Yes.

 In the lab?
 Yes.

They're training dogs
to operate the centrifuge...

for when they need dogs to operate
the centrifuge for blind scientists.

I have to go.


Howard, it's the phone.

I know it's the phone, Ma.
I hear the phone.

 Well, who's calling at this ungodly hour?
 I don't know.

Well, ask them why they're calling
at this ungodly hour.

How can I ask them
when I'm talking to you?

Hello?

Howard, it's Leonard. Code milky green.

 Dear Lord, not milky green.
 Affirmative. With fever.

 Who's on the phone?
 It's Leonard.

 Why is he calling?
 Sheldon's sick.

Were you playing with him?

For God's sake, Ma, I'm 26 years old.

Excuse me, Mr. Grownup.

 What do you want for breakfast?
 Chocolate milk and Eggos, please.

 Howard, listen to me.
 Hang on. Call waiting.

 No, don't... Don't...
 Hello?

Howard, I'm sick.

Howard's sleeping. This is his mother.

Why are you calling
at this ungodly hour?

I need soup.

Then call your own mother.


It was Sheldon.

 I tried to stop you.
 It's my own fault.

I forgot the protocol we put in place
after the great ear infection of '06.

You call Koothrappali.

We need to find a place to lay low
for the next 18 to 24 hours.

Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?

I just had the carpet steamed.

That's a negatory.

But there's a Planet of the Apes marathon
at the Nuart today.

Five movies, two hours apiece.

It's a start.

Homeless crazy guy at Table 18.



No, just crazy.

Sheldon, what are you doing here?

 I'm sick. Thank you very much.
 How could you've gotten it from me?

 I'm not sick.
 You're a carrier.

All these people here are doomed.

 You're doomed.
 Shh!

Sheldon, what do you want?

I want soup.


Why didn't you just...?


Why didn't you just have soup at home?

Penny, I have an IQ of 187.

Don't you imagine
that if there were a way for me...

to have had soup at home,
I would have thought of it?

You can have soup delivered.

I did not think of that.

Clearly, febrile delirium is setting in.

Please bring me some soup
while I still understand what a spoon is for.

Okay. What kind of soup do you want?

Well, my mother used to make me
this split-pea...

with little frankfurter slices
and these homemade croutons.

We have chicken, tortilla and potato leek.

Can I get any of those with little
frankfurter slices and homemade croutons?

No.

Then surprise me.


Would you call that moss green
or forest green?

Look at this. Everyone went chimp.

I'd like to point out, I voted for orangutan...

but you shouted me down.


 Hey, where are you?

I'm at work.

You sound funny.

Oh, I'm in a radiation suit.

 What's up?
 Yeah, well, I'm at work too.

And you'll never guess who's here
infecting my entire station.

Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory.

 Just tell him to go home.
 Well, he won't leave.

He says he's afraid he'll pass out on the
bus and someone will harvest his organs.

He's paranoid
and he's established a nest.

Can you please come get him?

Uh, yeah, I'd be happy to, Penny.


there's a breach in the radiation unit.

The whole city is in jeopardy.

Oh, my God. Professor Guggenheim
is melting. Gotta go. Bye.

 I feel really guilty.

Take your stinking paws off my popcorn...

you damn dirty ape.

Thanks for bringing me home.

Oh, it's okay.
I didn't really need to work today.

It's not like I have rent
or car payments or anything.

Good, good.

Okay, well, you feel better.

Wait. Where are you going?

Um, home to write some bad checks.

You're going to leave me?

Sheldon, you are a grown man.
Haven't you ever been sick before?

Of course, but not by myself.

Really? Never?

Well, once, when I was 15
and spending the summer...

at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.

 Studying abroad?
 No, visiting professor.

Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more
sausage-based than I'm used to...

and the result
was an internal blitzkrieg...

with my lower intestine
playing the part of Czechoslovakia.

And there was no one there
to take care of you?

No, my mom had to fly back to Texas
to help my dad...

because the house had slipped off
the cinder blocks again.

 Again?
 It was tornado season.

And it was an aluminum house.

Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty
residence didn't speak any English.

When I finally managed
to convince her I was sick...

she said,
"Möchtest du eine Darmspülung?"

What does that mean?

Based on what happened next, I assume
it means, "Would you like an enema?"

Okay, sweetie. I'll take care of you.
What do you need?

Well, my mom used to give me
sponge baths.

Okay, ground rules:

No sponge baths
and definitely no enemas.

Agreed.

Here we go.
Ten and a half hours of apey goodness.



Damn it, my glasses.

Okay, I'm blind here, guys.
Can you help me find them?

 Sorry.
 Okay.


Found them.


 Oh, great.
 I'm sorry. Don't you have a spare?

 Yeah, at home.
 If you leave now, you can be back...

before the gorillas whip
the crap out of Charlton Heston.

Unless Sheldon's there.

You'll be trapped forever
in his whiny, hyper-neurotic snot web.

Hi, Penny?

I was just wondering,
is Sheldon still at the restaurant?

Okay, that was very nice of you.
Okay, I gotta go.

Got kind of a full-blown
Chernobyl thing here. Gotta go, bye.

He's home. I'm screwed.

Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.

How about Lasik?

 You want me to get eye surgery?
 Would you rather go back...

and deal with Sheldon or have a stranger
carve out your corneas with a laser beam?

 Well?
 I'm thinking.

Okay, nice and cozy.

 Okay, I'll see you later.
 Wait.

Will you please rub this on my chest?

Oh, Sheldon. Can't you do that yourself?

VapoRub makes my hands smell funny.

 But, Sheldon...
 Please, please, please.

I can't believe I'm doing this.

No, no. Counterclockwise,
or my chest hair mats.

Sorry.


Can you sing "Soft Kitty"?

What?

My mom used to sing it to me
when I was sick.

 I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.
 I'll teach you.

Soft kitty, warm kitty

Little ball of fur

Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

Purr, purr, purr

Now you.


Soft kitty, warm kitty

Little ball of fur

Keep rubbing.

Little ball of fur

What do you see? What do you see?
I can't...

 Living room appears to be empty.
 Okay, he must be in his bedroom.

My spare glasses are in my bedroom,
on my dresser, next to my bat signal.

I'm not going in there.

 Raj?
 No way, Jose.

 But I can't do it. I can't see anything.
 It's all right.

Wireless mini-cam
and Bluetooth headset.

We'll be your eyes.

 Fine.
 One more thing.

This is a sub-sonic impact sensor.

If Sheldon gets out of bed
and starts to walk...

this will register it
and send a signal to the laptop.

At that point, based on the geography of
the apartment and the speed of Sheldon...

you'll have seven seconds to get out,
glasses or no glasses.

Won't my footsteps set it off?

No. You'll be on your hands and knees.

Now, you'll need to get the sensor
close to Sheldon's room.

How do I carry it
if I'm on my hands and knees?

Stay low.

Bear left.

 Now keep true.
 What?

 It means go straight.
 Then just say, "Go straight."

You don't say, "Go straight," when you're
giving bearings. You say, "Keep true."

All right.

I just hit my head.

Because you didn't keep true.

Okay, turn right.

The picture's breaking up.

Angle your head to the right.

Now, a little more.

Little more.

That's it. Now just keep true.

All right, you're close enough
to Sheldon's room. Deploy the sensor.

Now turn it on.

 It wasn't on?
 No.

Then why did I have to crawl?

Oh, I guess you didn't.

Okay, it's on.

Good. From this point forward,
you will have to crawl.

I know.


Hang on,
the sensor's picking up something.

Turn your head back.

You rat bastard.

Told you the sensor would work.

Hi.

You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.

Come on, I had to.
You see what he's like.

Penny? Penny, I'm hungry.

It's okay, sweetie. Good news.

 Leonard's home.
 No.

 Here you go, good luck, bye.
 Oh, wait, wait.

 Wait. Penny, take me with you.

Leonard?

I want grilled cheese.

Do you think Penny will come here
and take care of us?

I don't think Penny's
ever coming here again.

I'm very congested.

Yeah? So?

Can you go to the kitchen and get me
the turkey baster labeled, "Mucus"?

If I stand, I'll vomit.

Under the sink. Yellow Tupperware bowl.



Problem?

 This is Thai food.
 Here we go.

We don't have Thai food on Thursday.
We have pizza on Thursday.

that the third Thursday

Anything Can Happen Thursday.

Apparently the news didn't
reach my digestive system,

which, when startled,
has it's own version

of Anything Can Happen Thursday.

Anything Can Happen Thursday

is to get out of this rut
we've been in lately.

I think you mean "consistency."

And if we're going to abandon that,
then why even call it Thursday?

into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece,

a goat to the mighty god Ra.

I could go for some goat.

Sheldon, we agreed
we'd do something different tonight.

All right.
Let's go to the comic book store.

We went there last night.

Last night was Wednesday.
Wednesday is comic book night.

Tonight, we'll be going on Thursday,

because it's
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

Way to think outside
but pressed right up against the box.

So what are we going to do tonight?

If I may proffer a suggestion,

in bars all across
this great nation of ours,

Thursday night is Ladies' Night.

Which means,
as the evening progresses,

we will get better looking
courtesy of 99 cent margaritas

and two-for-one Jell-O shots.

Come on, Howard, the odds of us

picking up girls in a bar
are practically zero.

Really? Are you familiar
with the Drake Equation?

The one that estimates
the odds of making contact

with extraterrestrials
by calculating the product

of an increasingly restrictive
series of fractional values

such as those stars with planets,

and those planets
likely to develop life?

N equals R times FP
times NE times FL

times FI times FC times L?

Yeah, that one.

You can modify it
to calculate our chances

of having sex by changing
the formula to use the number

of single women in Los Angeles,

the number of those who might
find us attractive,

and what I call
the Wolowitz Coefficient.

"The Wolowitz Coefficient"?

Neediness times dress size squared.

Crunching the numbers,
I come up with a conservative

5,812 potential sex partners
within a 40-mile radius.

You're joking.

I'm a horny engineer, Leonard.

I never joke about math or sex.

What are we waiting for?
Let's bounce, bitches.

You're right.

It's Anything Can Happen Thursday.
Let's hit the clubs and meet hot women!

Here we go.
Lock up your daughters!

We're going to hit it and quit it.

Or we could finish eating
and go to the comic book store.

Also a good plan.

But next Anything Can Happen Thursday,
we're definitely going to a bar.

Absolutely.

You heard that, Ladies' Night ladies?
We're eventually coming for you!

Fascinating.

Subtitles: The FW Team

 Hey, guys. Where're you headed?
 To the comic book store.

"The comic book store? On a Thursday?

and into a land of madness."

to take into account,

Anything Can Happen Thursday.

You got me.

While you're there, could pick me up
a few comics for my nephew's birthday?


featuring talking babies


optimistically-named "funny pages."

for my nephew's birthday?

Sure. What does he like?

I don't know, he's 13.
Just pick out anything.

"Just pick out anything"?

for him without knowing his size.

without knowing his aptitude.

without knowing his fiber requirements.

about little marshmallows.

 Amazing Spider-Man,

Spectacular Spider-Man,

The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man,
Spider-Man 2099?

Why don't you just come with us?

That's what I was trying to avoid.

I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.

What a cute, little store.

Everybody's staring at me.

than you are of them.

Unlikely.

Here, what about this one
for my nephew?

 A superb choice.
 Oh, great.

Infinite Crisis and 52,

reestablishment of the DC multiverse.

What's a "multiverse"?


Come on, I'll help you
pick something.

That's right. She's with us.

Guys like that are so pathetic.

Tell me about it.

Look, a new Batman belt buckle.

Hey, Leonard.
Can I help you find something?

Hey, Stuart. This is Penny.
She's looking for some comic books.

Oh, really.

Blink twice if you're here
against your will.

I think we're fine, Stuart.

 Let me know if you need anything.
 Thanks.

He seems like a nice guy.

You mean for someone
who's into comic books?

I just meant for... yeah.

Just because people appreciate
comic books doesn't make them weirdos.

Stuart's a terrific artist.

He went to the Rhode Island
School of Design.

What about the guy over there

in the superhero T-shirt
tucked into his sweatpants?

Yeah, that's Captain Sweatpants.

He doesn't really help
the point I'm trying to make.

 Got it. Got it.
 Got it. Got it.

Need it!

Let it go.

Why? I saw it first.

 Yes, but I saw it from the front.
 A far less impressive feat.

Come on! I need this
for my Batman collection.

 I need it for my Robin collection.
 Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?

Why would I gamble?
It's mine. Let go.

 You let go.
 No, you!

Problem?

 He won't let go of my comic book.
 It's my comic book!

We need a ruling.

Cut it in half?

 Excuse me.
 Hello again.

Hi. What would you recommend
as a present for a 13-year-old boy?

A 13-year-old girl.

But if you're dead set
on a comic book, try...

this.

Hellblazer.
What's this about?

A morally ambiguous confidence man

who smokes, has lung cancer

and is tormented
by the spirits of the undead.

If it doesn't make me the favorite aunt,
I don't know what will.

Is this me?

Depends. Do you like it?

 It's really good.
 Yes, that's you.

That's so sweet,
but what if I didn't like it?

It'd still be you,
but I'd feel like an idiot.

I don't believe it.
Stuart's putting the moves on Penny.

I have got to learn how to draw.

Once again, defeated
by your own prurient interests.

Guys, have you seen Stuart
all up in Penny's business over there?

Nobody's up in anybody's business.
Let's just buy our stuff and go.

Okay, you've got my number.

 Now, give me the picture.
 You drive a hard bargain.

But here.

All right.
So, just give me a call.

So, Leonard, how are you enjoying
Anything Can Happen Thursday?

Look at that.
That's a dent.

Thank you,
Howard "Ham-Fisted" Wolowitz.

Did you just shut the TV off
in the middle of the classic

Deep Space Nine/Star Trek:
The Original Series

"Trouble With Tribbles"
crossover episode?

Apparently so.

Are you ill?

All right.

Then is it fair to say
that you're experiencing

some sort of emotional turmoil
over the events

involving Penny
earlier this evening?

When did you pick up on that?

A moment ago, when you turned off the TV
in the middle of during the classic

Deep Space Nine/Star Trek:
The Original Series

"Trouble With Tribbles"
crossover episode.

Would you like some advice?

Sure, why not?

Then, this is the perfect
time to launch a blog

with an interactive
comments section.

Thanks a lot.

Would you rather I offer
my personal insight?

I don't need any insights.

I just want to know why Penny's
more interested in Stuart than me.

We're practically the same guy.

I disagree.

Stuart is taller,
artistic, self-employed

and, most significantly,
he gets 45 percent off comic books.

You're right. I really should be
asking strangers on the Internet.

My original point.

Chinese food, vintage video games...

After the nightmare of
Anything Can Happen Thursday,

this is Friday night
the way it was meant to be.

Who's up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?

Hey, Penny...
and Stuart.

 Hey, guys.
 So what are you kids up to?

Stuart has a piece in an art show
that's opening tonight.

And you guys are going together.
Great...

It is great.

Really great.

Freaking awesome.

 What are you guys doing?
 It's Friday night,

Chinese food and vintage
video games, right?

Vintage doesn't even begin
to describe what we have planned.

Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980
interactive text adventure, Zork.

It's the buggy beta version.

Zork. Well, you guys have fun.

 See you guys.
 See you, Stuart.

Hey, Howard?

Take me to a bar with women.

 Really?
 Yeah.

Let me just go inside
and slip off my underwear.

Why?

Well, if I get lucky, I don't want
to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.

Do you...? Let's go.

May I have a grasshopper
with a little umbrella, please?

 No, he may not.
 Why?


with a little umbrella.


Wrong again!

Come on, You know I can't talk to women

unless I'm lit up
like the Hindu festival of Devali.

Look, There are plenty
of bars in Los Angeles

where you can order grasshoppers
and chocolate martinis,

but you wouldn't have to
because there are no women in them.

Gotcha.

I'll have a Brandy Alexander.

All right, the Three Musketeers
just became the Dynamic Duo.

Should we talk
to some of these women?

It's way too early
in the night for that.

See, First we let the lawyers and the jocks
thin the herd, and then...

we go after the weak
and the old and the lame.

That's your system?

That's my system.

And if you spot a chick
with a Seeing Eye dog, she's mine.

Come on. I think it's nice

that Captain Sweatpants
showed up to your art opening.

Yeah, it would have been nicer
if he hadn't touched all the cheese.

You know, it's kind of early.

Do you want to maybe come in
for some coffee or something?

Gee, it's a little late
for coffee, isn't it?

You think "coffee," means coffee.
That is so sweet.

Come on. I think I have decaf.

Good, Stuart.

I thought I heard your voice.
Do you have a moment?

 Yeah, I guess.
 Sheldon, we're a little busy here, so...

 What are you doing?
 We're having coffee.

Isn't it a little late for coffee?

It's okay. She thinks she has decaf.

I'll just go look for it.

 What's up?
 I've spent the last three hours

in an online debate
in the DC Comics Batman chatroom,

 and I need your help.
 Yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn.

 What's the topic?
 I am asserting,

in the event
that Batman's death proves permanent,

the original Robin, Dick Grayson,

is the logical successor
to the Bat Cowl.

Sheldon, I'm afraid
you couldn't be more wrong.

More wrong?

Wrong is an absolute state
and not subject to gradation.

Of course it is. It's a little wrong
to say a tomato is a vegetable.

It's very wrong to say
it's a suspension bridge.

But returning to the original issue,
Dick Grayson became Nightwing,

a superhero in his own right.

Batman 2 has to be
the second Robin, Jason Todd.

Has to be? Has to be?

I hope you're being
deliberately provocative.

 I found the decaf!
 Great!

Herbal tea for me, please.

Barkeep!

Alexander me.

How about those two?

They're eating peanuts.

And my allergies, one kiss would put me
in Cedars-Sinai for a week.

What about the ones in the corner?

Possible. Very possible.

Do You want the one in the whiplash collar
or the one who keeps blinking?

I think Blinky's cute.

You got it, sir.

Wait, so we just go over there?

We have a little prep work to do.

Put this in your mouth.
We walk past them, you stumble a bit.

I say, sorry,
my friend's had a little too much.

And then I start
to pull it out of your mouth.

And say, "A little too much fun."

Get it?

I mean, They're laughing, we're laughing.

Then we get them up
to about a .15 blood alcohol level,

and tell them we're millionaires.

What else you got?

Depends. Are you
willing to sit on my lap

and pretend to be
a ventriloquist dummy?

I can't sit on your lap.
You don't know the routine.

I'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck
in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe.

Of course I am.

Removing Joe Chill as the killer
of Batman's parents

effectively deprived him
of his raison d'�tre.

Okay. You can Throw all the French around you want,
it doesn't make you right.

Au contraire.

Plus, you're forgetting
that the Infinite Crisis storyline

restored Joe Chill
to the Batman mythology.

I am forgetting nothing
and I resent your tone.

Look, Sheldon, it's late.
I've got to get some sleep.

 So, I win.
 No, I'm tired.

So, I win.

 Fine. You win.
 Darn tootin', I win.

Penny, I really had
a terrific time...

No, don't wake her.

She'll maul you
like a rabid wolverine.

You know, I don't think
that was decaf.

Wait. Is this your card or isn't it?

Trust me. This was their card.

I thought you were good at this.

You're always talking about
how you go to bars and meet women.

I do, all the time.

Well, what happened?
We've been sitting here all night

and the longest conversation you've had
with a woman was when your mom called.

You're just going to make me
come out and say it, aren't you?

Say what?

You're weighing me down.

I'm a falcon who hunts better solo.

Fine. I'll sit here.
You take flight and hunt.

Don't be ridiculous.
You can't just tell a falcon when to hunt.

Actually, you can.

There's a whole sport
built around it.

Falconry.

Shut up.

Let's just get Koothrappali and go.

Lucky bastard.

It's got to be
that stupid accent of his.

Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz
from Bombay.

Okay, I'm stumped.



What you doing?

Attempting to view work
as a peripheral image...

so as to engage
the superior colliculus of my brain.

Interesting. I usually just have coffee.

 You've been up all night?
 Is it morning?

 Yes.
 Then I've been up all night.

And you're stuck?

Why else would a person try to engage
their superior colliculus?

Uh, sorry, sweetie.
I can't help you till I've had my coffee.

If you don't put him in his crate at night,
he just runs around the apartment.

What is he doing now?

Mm, he's either isolating the terms
of his formula...

and examining them individually...

or looking for the alligator
that swallowed his hand...

after Peter Pan cut it off.

Captain Hook's hand was eaten
by a crocodile, not an alligator.

If you're going to mock me,
at least get your facts straight.

Aye, aye, captain.

I can't see it.

It just won't coalesce.

Maybe you need a fresh start.

You're right.

Great idea, Leonard. Thank you.

Electrons move through graphene,
act as if they have no mass.

How long has he been stuck?

Mm, intellectually, about 30 hours.

Emotionally, about 29 years.

Unit cell contains two carbon atoms.

Interior angle of a hexagon
is 120 degrees.

Have you tried rebooting him?

No. I think it's a firmware problem.

Hey, it's disco night
at the Moonlight Roller Rink tonight.

Who's up for getting down?

Oh, that's perfect.

Bernadette's been hawking me
to take her roller skating.

Penny likes to skate.
The four of us could double.

We're in.

Great. It's not like I brought it up
because I wanted to go.

 You can come with us.
 No. I don't have to go.

I'm happy just to guide you
to suitable entertainment choices.

I'm a walking, brown yelp.com.

Structure, constant structure.
One atom.

Boy, he's really gone, isn't he?

Yeah. This morning he used
a stick of butter as deodorant.

I thought I smelled popcorn.

The same as fermions.
Travels on a pathway.

Hexagonal. Always hexagonal.

I haven't seen him this stuck since he
tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.

Hey. Those are my lima beans.

Not lima beans. Carbon atoms.

But if I don't eat my lima beans,
I can't have my cookie.

Here. You want my peas?

Peas. Perfect. They can be electrons.

You want my corn?

Don't be ridiculous.

What would I do with corn?

Roller skating.
Shall we grab a bite to eat first?

Good. P.F. Chang's?
My mom has coupons.

Oh, great.

 Your mom is not coming, right?
 Not this time. I promise.

Just to be clear,
roller-skating was my idea.

I'm unhappy
that you turned it into a date...

and I hope you both fall on your asses
and break your coccyxes.

The plural of "coccyx" is "coccyges."

Screw you.
Give me back my lima beans.

Oh, my God.
Have you ever been so embarrassed?

Not recently.

I don't know which was lamer,
their roller skating or their disco dancing.

For me, the worst part was when
people saw us leave with them.

You had some nice moves out there,
Howard.

 Thanks. You too.
 You noticed all the people looking at us?

Not really. I was in my boogie zone.

 And when Howard tried to do the splits?
 Shh.

Sorry, I'm moving slow.

 I think I bruised my coccyx.
 Aw, poor baby.

Don't tell Koothrappali.

 After you.
 Oh. What a gentleman.

Hey, Sheldon.

Oh, my God, are you...? Whoa!

Good Lord! You're ruining everything!

 Oh, damn.
 Are you okay?

Do I look okay?

Don't bark at me. I fell too.

You've been falling all night.
You're used to it.

Sheldon, what are you doing?

The same thing I've been doing.

Trying to figure out why electrons
have no mass...

 ...when traveling through graphene.
 With marbles?

I needed something bigger
than peas, now, didn't I?

Sheldon, when was the last time
you got any sleep?

Two, three days.

Not important. I don't need sleep.
I need answers.

I need to determine where
in this swamp of unbalanced formulas...

squateth the toad of truth.

The toad of truth?
Is that a physics thing?

No. That's a crazy thing.

Okay, Sheldon.

What happens to our neuroreceptors
when we don't get enough REM sleep?

They lose their sensitivity to serotonin
and norepinephrine.

Which leads to...

Impaired cognitive function.

Right. So march in there,
brush your teeth and go to bed.

But I don't wanna go to bed.

I'm gonna count to three. One...

Oh, all right.

That was amazing
how you handled him.

I know how to deal
with stubborn children.

My mother used to run an illegal
daycare center in our basement.

Leonard. You're giggling in your sleep.

It's not me. It's my new ring tone.

The Joker. From Batman.

Well, it creeps me out.

Me too. But I paid 3 bucks for it.

Well, just answer the phone.

Hello?

Yeah, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

Yeah. He's my roommate.

Oh. Is he okay?

All right. I'll be right there.

What happened?

Sheldon's escaped
and is terrorizing the village.

Okay, have fun.

Hi. I'm Dr. Hofstadter.

 Where is he?
 Ball pit.

 Thanks for not calling the cops.
 Oh, it's no big deal.

My sister's got a kid who's special.

Yeah, well, he's extra special.

Hey, Shelly.

What you doing?

Size ratio was all wrong.
Couldn't visualize it.

Needed bigger carbon atoms.

Sure, sure.

How did you get into this place?

Back door has a five-pin tumbler system,
single circuit alarm. Child's play.

You can start sorting
protons and neutrons...

while I build carbon atoms.

No, I don't think so.
We need to go home now.

But I'm still working.

If you don't come out of there,
I'm gonna have to drag you out.

You can try...

but you'll never catch me.

For God sakes.

Sheldon, come here!

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Leonard and Penny.

 Leonard and Penny.
 Aah!

What? What, what, what?

Leonard and Penny.

 What?
 I have good news.

And you had to barge in
and wake us up...

 ...in the middle of the night?
 Your cell phone was off.

Because we didn't
wanna be disturbed.

That didn't work out, did it?

Sheldon, what do you want?

I came to tell you I've got the answer.

Really?

You figured out
the graphene problem?

No, I'm still hopelessly stuck on that.
But I figured out how to figure it out.

I know I said I could handle
your roommate, but I was wrong.

We have to break up.

What are you talking about?

 Ahem.
 Oh.

Einstein.

Yeah. I'm gonna need a little more.

Albert Einstein.

Keep going.

When Einstein came up
with special relativity...

he was working
at the patent office.

So you're gonna go work
at the patent office?

Oh, don't be absurd.
That's in Washington.

I could never live in a city
whose streets are laid out...

in a wheel-and-spoke pattern.

No. I'm going to find
a similarly menial job...

where my basal ganglia are occupied
with a routine task...

freeing my prefrontal cortex
to work quietly in the background.

A great plan.

Of course. Even talking to you
is sufficiently menial.

I can feel the proverbial juices
starting to flow.

Okay.
Well, thanks for sharing with us.

 Good night.
 You're welcome.

Good night to you too.

Oh. By the way, I was watching you sleep
for a moment.

I noticed your snoring seems to be worse
when you're on your back.

No. Leonard doesn't snore.

No. I wasn't talking to Leonard.

Told you.

So, Mr. Cooper,
you're looking for a job.

A menial job.

Like yours.

Why, thank you for noticing.

I'm menial employee of the month.

Do you have a particular field in mind?

I do. For thousands of years...

the lowest classes of the human race
have spent their lives laboring...

to erect monuments
under the lash of betters.

Until finally they dropped down
and became one with the dust...

through which they trudged.

Do you have anything like that?

 No.
 Shouldn't you check your database?

No.

You didn't really type.

I didn't really have to.

So how about construction?

Oh, that would be good.

Yeah, sawing, hammering,
eating out of a lunch pail...

as my working-class fellows and I
sit perched precariously on a girder...

high above the metropolis.

No, no. This is putting up sheetrock
at a housing project in Rosemead.

 I could do that.
 Good.

 One question.
 Yes?

What's sheetrock?

Moving on.

How about doing deliveries
for a florist?

That seems acceptable.

 Do you have your own car?
 I don't drive.

Of course you don't.

Mr. Cooper,
let me just ask you a question.

What was your last job?

Senior theoretical particle physicist
at CaITech, focusing on M Theory.

Or in layman's terms, string theory.

I see.

Just give me a second.

Security!

Okay.
I'll get those drinks started for you.

Behind you.

Sheldon? What the hell are you doing?

Trying to get these tables cleared.
We're slammed.

No, wait. Wait. No, wait.
What are you doing here?

A reasonable question.

I asked myself:

"What is the most mind-numbing,
pedestrian job conceivable?"

Three answers came to mind.

A toll booth attendant,
an Apple store genius...

and what Penny does.

Now, since I don't like touching
other people's coins...

and I refuse to contribute
to the devaluation of the word "genius"...

here I am.

You just walked in
and they hired you?

 Just like that?
 Oh, heavens no.

Since I don't need to be paid,
I didn't need to be hired.

I simply came in, picked up a tray
and started working for the man.

Let me get that plate out of your way.

Sheldon, this is ridiculous.

Is it? Just a moment ago,
I had a minor epiphany...

regarding polymer degradation
phenomenon...

while scraping congealed nachos
off a plate.

 Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
 Thanks.

Sheldon, wait. This isn't even what I do.
I'm a waitress, not a busboy.

You're right. That is more menial.

Hello, I'm Sheldon.
I'll be your server today.

I don't recommend the salmon.

I saw it in the kitchen.

All right. One bacon cheeseburger...

breaking two Jewish
dietary restrictions simultaneously.

Kudos.

And beer-battered fish and chips.

Now, here's your tartar sauce.
I also brought you salsa.

A little unconventional,
but I think you'll like it. It's zingy.

And for you, Factory Burrito Grande,
no cheese, no sour cream...

no ugly consequences
from your lactose intolerance.

Hang on.

 Black beans, not pinto beans?
 Yes.

 Guacamole? No cilantro? Lettuce?
 Yep.

 Understand why I'm doing this?
 I do.

That'll be all.

That was fun.

How long can he keep this up?

I heard about this professor
who melted down, bought a van...

spent the rest of his life
as a dog groomer.

Never went back to the university?

Only to shampoo
Professor Shamburg's shih tzu.

Sheesh.

You know, I bet if we all chipped in,
we could buy Sheldon a van.

But he's afraid of dogs.

Yeah. That's the only thing wrong
with that plan.

Hey, guys. Sorry you had to wait,
but we are swamped.

What's this?

Sheldon took our order.

Sheldon doesn't work here.

Well, honey, not to complain...

but we were starting to think
you didn't either.

Is that really necessary?

Good Lord.

The interference pattern
in the fracture.

The motion of the wave
through the structure.

I've been looking at it all wrong.

I can't consider
the electrons as particles.

They move through the graphene
as a wave.

It's a wave!

The moment to applaud would be now.

Troglodytes.

Sheldon. Where are you going?
Aren't you gonna clean this?

I'm sorry, I don't work here.

 Happy now?
 I'm on a cloud.

Swing me.

Not much between despair and ecstasy

One night in Bangkok
And the tough guys tumble

Can't be too careful with your company

I can feel the devil walking next to me

Sheldon, come here!

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.



All right,
I'm moving my infantry division...

augmented by a battalion of orcs
from Lord of the Rings.

We flank the Tennessee volunteers...

and the North once again
wins the Battle of Gettysburg.

Not so fast. Remember, the South
still has two infantry divisions.

Plus Superman and Godzilla.

No, no, no. Orcs are magic.

Superman is vulnerable to magic.

Not to mention,
you already lost Godzilla...

to the Illinois cavalry and Hulk.

Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee
charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?

 You guys ready to order?
 Hang on.

Shiva and Ganesh?

The Hindu gods
against the entire Union Army?

And orcs.

I'll be back.

Excuse me. Ganesh is the remover
of obstacles and Shiva's the destroyer.

When the smoke clears,
Lincoln will be speaking Hindi...

and drinking mint juleps.

My boss says you have to either
order or leave and never come back.

What do you recommend for someone
with a man-sized appetite...

from a morning of
weight-training and cardio-funk?

A shower.

I'll take the heart-smart platter.

All right, thank you. And Sheldon?

We don't eat here.
I don't know what's good.

 Well, it's all good.
 Statistically unlikely.

Just get a hamburger.
You like hamburgers.

I like the hamburgers
where we usually eat.

You can't make the assumption
that I'll like the hamburgers here.

I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.

Which one,
the classic, the ranch house...

the barbeque burger
or the Kobe burger?

Can't we just go to Big Boy?

 They only have one burger, the Big Boy.
 The barbeque burger's like the Big Boy.

In a world that already
includes a Big Boy...

why would I settle for something
like a Big Boy?

Because you are not at Big Boy.

 Fine. I'll have the barbeque burger.
 Make it two.

Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.

Hey, Leonard. Hi, guys.

 Hey.
 Hey, Leslie.

 I didn't know you ate here.
 We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.

Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across
the hall from Sheldon and me.

And walks in quiet beauty
like the night.

Howard, I've asked you not to do that.

Leslie and I do research together
at the university.

Oh, wow. A girl scientist.

Yep. Come for the breasts,
stay for the brains.

So I'm glad I ran into you.

The Physics Department string quartet
needs a new cellist.

What happened to Elliott Wong?

Switched over to high-energy
radiation research, had a mishap.

And now the other guys
are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

 So are you in?
 Yeah, sure. Why not?

 We rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
 Why at my place?

Yeah, Department of Energy said
our regular space is kind of a hot zone.

 Nice meeting you.
 Yeah, you too.

Leonard, I didn't know
you played the cello.

Yeah, my parents felt
that naming me Leonard...

and putting me
in advanced-placement classes...

wasn't getting me beaten up enough.

If you're into music, I happen
to be a human beatbox...

 ...so...
 Really?


I'm actually not that into music.

Your friend's really cute.
Anything going on with you two?

Leslie?

No, no. What, are you kidding?

He asked her out once.
It was an embarrassing failure.

Thank you, Sheldon.

I'm sorry.
Was that supposed to be a secret?

That's too bad.
You guys would make a cute couple.

 Oh, dear.
 What's the matter?

She didn't take my order.

How could she take your order
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?

Nevertheless,
this will be reflected in her tip.

"you'd make a cute couple"?

I assume she meant
the two of you...

would constitute a couple
that others might consider cute.

An alternate and less likely interpretation
is that you could manufacture one.

As in, "Look, Leonard and Leslie
made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb.

Aren't they adorable?"

If Penny didn't know
that Leslie had turned me down...

then that would mean that she, Penny,
thought I should ask her, Leslie, out...

indicating that Penny had no interest
in me asking her out.

But because she did know
I had asked Leslie out...

and that she, Leslie,
had turned me down...

then she, Penny,
could be offering consolation.

"That's too bad,
you would have made a cute couple."

But while thinking,
"Good, Leonard remains available."

You're a lucky man, Leonard.

How so?

You're talking to one of
the three men in the West...

capable of following
that train of thought.

Well, what do you think?

I said I could follow it,
I didn't say I cared.


I admire your fingering.

Thank you.

Maybe sometime you can
try that on my instrument.

 Thanks.

See you next week.

 That was fun. Thanks for including me.
 You're welcome.

If you're up for it, we could practice
that middle section again.

Sure. Why not?


Just so we're clear, you understand
me hanging back to practice with you...

is a pretext for letting you know
that I'm sexually available.


Really?

Yeah, I'm good to go.

I thought you weren't interested in me.

That was before I saw you handling that
beautiful piece of wood between your legs.

You mean my cello.

No, I mean the obvious,
crude double entendre.

I'm seducing you.

No kidding.

What can I say?
I'm a passionate and impulsive woman.

So how about it?

Gee...

 Is it the waitress?
 Penny? What about her?

I saw your pupils dilate
when you looked at her...

which, unless you're a heroin addict,
points to sexual attraction.

I did have a poppy-seed bagel
for breakfast...

which could give
a positive urine test for opiates...

but certainly not dilate my pupils...

so I guess there was no point
in bringing it up.

 You and the waitress, then.
 No, no.

There's nothing going on
between Penny and me.

So you're open to a sexual relationship?

Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.

 Good.
 Yeah, it is.

It is good.

Did you wanna start now?

 Why don't we finish this section first?
 Oh, okay.

A little musical foreplay. Terrific.



 I'm... Good to go.
 Me too.

Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What's going on?

I need your opinion
on a matter of semiotics.

 I'm sorry?
 Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols.

It's a branch of philosophy
related to linguistics.

Okay, sweetie, I know you think
you're explaining yourself...

but you're really not.

Just come with me.

Tell me have you ever really

Really, really ever loved a woman?

Well?

 Well, what?
 What does it mean?

Come on, you went to college.

Yes, but I was 11.

A tie on the doorknob usually means
someone doesn't wanna be disturbed...

because they're, you know,
getting busy.

So you're saying
Leonard has a girl in there?

Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack
and gotten really into Bryan Adams.

Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.

We really shouldn't be standing here.

This is very awkward.

Oh, come on. You know,
Leonard's had girls over before, right?

Oh, yes. But there's usually planning,
courtship, advance notice.

You know, last time, I was able to book
a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.

Wait, wait. You had to leave the state
because your roommate was having sex?

I didn't have to.
The dates just happened to coincide.

So do you know who's in there?

Well, there's Leonard.

And he's either with Leslie Winkle
or a 1930s gangster.

Hmm. Good for him.

Good for Leonard.

Okay. Night.

No, don't. Wait, hold on.

 What's the matter?
 I don't know what the protocol is here.

Do I stay? Do I leave?

Do I wait to greet them
with a refreshing beverage?

Gee, Sheldon,
you're asking the wrong girl.

I'm usually on the other side
of the tie.



Hi, Leonard?

It's me.

Sheldon.

In the living room.

I just...
I wanted you to know I saw the tie.

Message received.

You're welcome.

You carry on. Give my best to Leslie.

Big Boy.



Someone touched my board.

Oh, God, my board.

Leonard.

Leonard!

Hey, what's the matter?

Equations.
Someone's tampered with my equations.

 Are you sure?
 Of course.

Look at the beta function
of quantum chromodynamics.

The sign's been changed.

Oh, yeah.

But doesn't that fix the problem
you've been having?

Are you insane?
Are you out of your mind?

Are you...? Hey, look, that fixes
the problem I've been having.

You're welcome.

You did this?

Yeah. I noticed it when I got up
to get water, so I fixed it.

Now you can show quarks are
asymptotically free at high energies.

Pretty cool, huh?

"Cool"?

Listen, I gotta get to the lab.

Thanks for a great night.

Thank you. I'll see you at work.

 Hold on. Hold on.
 What?

 Who told you you could touch my board?
 No one.

I don't come into your house
and touch your board.

There are no incorrect equations
on my board.

Oh, that is so, so...

I'm sorry, I gotta run. If you
come up with an adjective, text me.


Inconsiderate. That is the adjective.
Inconsiderate.

You can stare at your board all day,
she's still going to be right.

I'm not staring, I'm mulling.

 Oh, hey, Leonard.
 Hi.

So how's it going?

Pretty good.

Just pretty good? I'd think
you were doing very good.

"Pretty, very." There's really no objective
scale for delineating variations of good.

Why do you ask?

Well, a little bird told me that
you and Leslie hooked up last night.

 Sheldon!

So is it serious? Do you like her?

I don't...

That's really two different questions.
I'm not...

Sheldon, we have to go.

Boy, you're wound awfully tight
for a man who just had sexual intercourse.

All right, well, I'll talk to you later.
But I am so happy for you, Leonard.

Thank you.


What did she mean, she's happy for me?

Is she happy because I'm seeing someone
or because she thinks I'm happy?

Because anyone who cared for someone
would want them to be happy...

even if the reason for their happiness
made the first person unhappy.

You know, because the second person,
though happy...

is now romantically unavailable
to the first person.

Do you realize I may have to share
a Nobel Prize with your booty call?

You know what?

I'm being ridiculous.

But who cares what Penny thinks?

Leslie is a terrific girl.
She's attractive. We like each other.

She's extremely intelligent.



I don't have to believe in it
for her to be lucky.

Regardless, I have a chance
at a real relationship with Leslie.

I'm not gonna pass that up for
some hypothetical future happiness...

with a woman who may
or may not want me to be happy...

with the woman
who is currently making me happy.


I still don't care.

Hey, Leslie.

Careful, Leonard. Liquid nitrogen,
320 degrees below zero.

Brrrr. Heh.

Why are you smashing
a flash-frozen banana?

Because I got a bowl of Cheerios
and I couldn't find a knife.

So anyway, hello.

What are you doing?

Just extending the intimacy.

Hey, do you wanna slip over
to the radiation lab...

and share a decontamination shower?

Okay, what exactly do you think's
going on between us?

I'm not sure, but I think I'm about
to discover how the banana felt.

Neither of us are neuroscientists, but we
both understand the biochemistry of sex.

Dopamine in our brains is released
across synapses, causing pleasure.

Stick electrodes in a rat's brain,
give him an orgasm button.

He'll push that thing
until he starves to death.

Well, who wouldn't? Heh.

The difference between us and the rat...

is you can't stick an electrode
in our hypothalamus.

That's where you come in.

Yeah, well,
I'm just glad to be a part of it. Heh.

So, what happens now?

Well, I don't know about your sex drive,
but I'm probably good till New Year's.

Oh.

Okay.

 Thank you.
 Thank you.

 You wanna make plans for New Year's?
 Please, you're smothering me.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Hey, look. It's Dr. Stud.

Doctor what?

The blogosphere is abuzzing
with news of you and Leslie...

making the bang, bang music.

 Well, how did it get on the Internet?
 I put it there.

Well, how did you know about it?

A little bird told us.

Apparently, you are a magnificent beast.

Well, that part's true.

I think I may have
misjudged this restaurant.

 No kidding.
 I don't wanna go out on a limb...

but I think we may be looking
at my new Tuesday hamburger.

Your old Tuesday hamburger
will be so brokenhearted.

Way ahead of you.

I was thinking of moving Big Boy to
Thursdays and just dropping Souplantation.

 Really?
 Yeah.

The name always confused me, anyway.
Souplantation.

You can't grow soup.

 So how's everything?
 Terrific.

You'll be happy to know I plan to come
every Tuesday for the foreseeable future.

Really? Oh, yay. Heh.

Who do I speak to about
permanently reserving this table?

I don't know, a psychiatrist?

So, hey.

 How are things with you and Leslie?
 Oh.

To be honest,
I don't think it's going to work out.

Oh, that's too bad.
Well, hey, don't worry.

I'm sure there's someone out there
who's just right for you.

Well, what did she mean by that?

Was that just a generic platitude
or was that a subtle bid for attention?

You know why this hamburger
surpasses the Big Boy?

This is a single-decker,
whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.

This has a much more satisfying
meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.

 Are you even listening to me?
 Of course I'm listening.

Blah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion,
blah, blah, blah.

Okay, then.

You know, you can grow
the ingredients for soup.




I wish you could all be inside my head.

The conversation is sparkling.

Fine, I'll tell you.

A lichen is an organism made up
of two separate species, fungi and algae.

If you could merge with another species,
what species would you pick and why?

Hint, there is a right answer.

None of you will get it.

Okay. Um, I'd pick swan
because, uh, the resulting hybrid...

would have the advanced
industrial civilization of a human...

and the long, graceful neck
I've always dreamed of having.

Wrong. Leonard?

Horse. But mostly just for the height.

A little bit for the genital girth.

Wrong. And let's keep it clean, shall we?

Kangaroo. Uh, I'd be a kangajew...

the first of my people
to dunk a basketball.

Also, instead of just living in your mother's
house, you could live inside her body.


Clever, but also wrong.

No. The best organism for human beings
to merge with is the lichen itself.

That way you'd be
human, fungus and algae.

Triple threat.

Like three-bean salad.

Give me one circumstance
that would be useful.

All right, picture this.
A beautiful outdoor concert.

Now, as a human,
I appreciate Beethoven.

As a fungus, I have a terrific view
growing out of a towering maple tree.

And no thank you expensive concessions
because as an algae...

I'll just snack on this sunlight.

 He got us again.
 No, he didn't.

Anyway, if it's okay with you,
we should talk about Howard's bachelor party.

Seems like a bit of a letdown
after our lichen conversation, but...

What do you know? You're half-swan.

I did some research on strippers.

One agency said
they can get us a great price...

if we're flexible on age range
and number of limbs.

Sounds like loads of fun,
but I promised Bernadette no strippers.

Heh, you don't want strippers?
You're the king of strippers.

That one club in North Hollywood
named a pole after you.

What can I tell you?

 I'm not into that stuff anymore.
 Good. I'm proud of you.

You're the first of us to get married.
We have to do something special.

Germans have an interesting
pre-wedding custom...

it's probably not for me.

Maybe we can go up to, uh, Napa Valley.
They've got that wine train...

Boo, wine. But, yay, trains. I'm in.

Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year.

You travel through the vineyards, there's
a tasting on board, and all the wildflowers...

are in bloom. It's magic.

Look at that. In 30 seconds,
we went from hiring women to being them.

So I hear you and the lost boys
are having a bachelor party tonight.

Yeah. Just going to a restaurant, get some
steaks, Scotch. Nothing to worry about.

Why should I worry?

It's a bachelor party. There could be
strippers. Wouldn't that make you jealous?

Uh, come on, Leonard, it's you.
What's gonna happen?

If there was a stripper, all you'd do...

is avoid eye contact and maybe offer
to help her kid with his homework.

Hey, I'm a young man
in his sexual prime.

Under the right conditions,
I am capable of just really crazy stuff.

Really? What is the craziest thing
you've ever done with a woman?

The time we had sex in the ocean
does not count.

Oh, come on, that's gotta count.

There was a really strong undertow.
We could've died.

Well, have fun tonight.

Oh, I will. There is no telling
what might happen.

Yeah, there is, heh.

You know, there's nothing wrong helping
some woman's kid get through their SATs.

I gotta hand it to Raj. He found
a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.

It's not bad. Unless you compare it
to a train. And then it stinks.

 Are you drinking whiskey?
 Indeed.

If I'm to participate in the social convention
that is the stag night...

then I must embrace
all its components...

including tobacco, swear words
and, yes, alcohol.

Jeepers, that's yucky.

Whoa, it's a little early to start dropping
J-bombs, don't you think?

 Hey, you guys.
 Hey. Nice of you to make it out for Howard.

It was either this or another
hot tub party at George Takei's house.

I'm confused.
I thought since our reconciliation...

I was your friend in this group.

 Oh, I'm friends with Howard too.
 Oh.

I guess you're just friends with anybody.

Agh!

Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight
at the comic book store.

I might need some help
covering my share of the check.

Oh, yeah. No worries.

 And maybe a few bucks for the valet.
 Oh, all right.

 And gas money to get home.
 Yeah, sure.

You know what,
this is my grandfather's watch...

 Oh.
 ...18-karat gold.

 Got it in Europe during the war.
 Wow, it's very nice.

Mm-hm. A hundred bucks and it's yours.

Hey, everybody,
the bachelor boy has arrived.


For he's a jolly good fellow

For he's a jolly good fellow

Which nobody can deny

Yes, yes, yes, he's a jolly good fellow.
What time do the strippers arrive?

Actually, Barry, we're not gonna have
strippers tonight.

Ugh, then what the frig did I get
$200 in singles out for?

You wanna buy a watch?

This is maid of honor,
Amy Farrah Fowler...

bringing you the wedding activities
just weeks out from the big day.

Let's check in with a beautiful,
radiant young woman...

and her friend
who's about to get married.

Ladies, can you tell us
what you're doing?

Um, these are gift bags we're gonna put
in the hotel rooms of our guests.

This is a map of Pasadena,
this is a list of local restaurants.

Then for Howie's relatives,
we have antihistamines, antacids...

and medicine
for diarrhea and constipation.

Ha, we labeled them "stop" and "go."

All right, pivoting to the big question.

Bernadette, on your wedding night,
you'll be consummating your marriage.

What do you think your first sexual position
will be as husband and wife?

Amy, please.

may set the tone for the marriage.

Okay, show's over.

Hey. They may conceive a child
on their wedding night.

Don't you think the kid might get a kick
out of knowing how it happened?

I don't care. Ask her things like,
"Are you gonna take Howard's name?"

Not "who's gonna sit on who?"

I've been thinking I'm gonna hyphenate.

Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.

Nice. You should totally get Bernadette
Maryann Rostenkowski-wolowitz.com...

before someone snaps it up.

Howard already took care of it.

He set up our beautiful wedding website
with cute facts...

about our family histories.

For a while in Poland, my family
and his family were neighbors.

 Oh, that's cool.
 No, it's not. I'll explain it to you later.


May I have your attention, please?

We are here tonight to celebrate
the upcoming nuptials of my best friend...

Howard Wolowitz.

Hear, hear.

And apparently Wil Wheaton's
best friend.

 Sheldon.
 Talk to the hand.

Does anyone have any words they'd like
to say about our man of the evening?

I do.


As is the tradition, I've prepared a series of
disrespectful jokes which generate humor...

at Howard's expense.
Prepare to have your ribs tickled.


Howard, I always thought you'd be
the last one of us to ever get married...

because you are so short
and unappealing, am I right?

Let's see here. Oh, seriously, though...

Howard, you're actually one of
the most intelligent people I know.

And that's a zinger because you're not.

I've always thought that you'd make
someone a fine husband someday.

Assuming you'd get the parts
and develop the engineering skills...

to assemble them,
which I don't see as likely. Hot-cha!


Okay, let me see. Okay, kidding aside.

Howard, you are a good friend
and I wish you nothing but happiness.

Buzzinga, I don't.

 Sheldon.
 Double buzzinga. I do.

Good luck following that.

So Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Ha, ha.

Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind.
He was a wild one.

But I guess we all kind of were.

I remember this one time,
I was with this girl at the beach.

We were in the ocean
and we started making out.

I know, it was crazy.

I wasn't even wearing my aqua socks.

 Then...
 Nobody cares, Hofstadter, wrap it up.

Right. To Howard.

To Howard!

I totally had sex in the ocean.

Okay, I'll go.

Howard, when I think about
you and Bernadette...

starting this wonderful life together...

I can't help but get a little choked up.
I mean...

look at you, you have everything.

Look at me. I'm 37...

I sleep in the back
of a comic book store...

and I have the bone density
of an 80-year-old man.

To Howard.

 Yes.

 Uh, who's next?
 I'll go.

Howard, I'm gonna say something
to you that everybody is thinking...

but no one has the courage
to say out loud.

When you invite a man to a bachelor party,
the implication is there will be strippers.

Maybe not completely nude...

but at least pasties and G-strings,
that's not unreasonable.

 Hear, hear!

Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh?

No? Okay.

It all comes down to me as the best man.
Ha-ha-ha.

Ooh, this grasshopper
is kicking my ass-hopper. Ha-ha-ha.

Okay, when I first came to this country,
I didn't know how to behave...

or how to dress, or what was cool.

I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard,
and suddenly my life changed...

because we could be lonely together.

This man became my whole world.

Yeah. Nice speech, Francine.

I'm not done, but thank you.

I think back...

to all the good times we had,
like, uh, when we went camping...

and spent that night
telling each other all our secrets.

I told him I'm addicted to pedicures...

and he told me
he lost his virginity to his cousin.


She was my second cousin.

And the first woman you ever disappointed
sexually. Bada-buzzinga!

Oh, yeah. And then there was the time when
Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas...

and paid a hooker
to pretend she was Jewish...

and that she wanted
his little kosher pickle.

Of all the "Howard humping hooker"
stories, that one's my favorite.

Okay, buddy, that's it. Sit down.

Oh! Oh.

Oh, what about that tubby girl in
the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-Con?

Don't remember. Please sit down.

The only threesome
I've ever had in my life...

and I'm proud to say
it was with this man right here!


 Please shut up.
 Oh, oh.

Don't get me wrong,
nothing happened with me and Howard.

There was about 200 pounds
of Sailor Moon between us.

Oh, Internet,
this is so going all over you.

Jeepers, I'm drunk.

Thank you for picking us up.

There's a warning right there
on the Scotch bottle.

You cannot be operating heavy machinery...

after you've had a snootful of this, laddie.


Funny. You boys have a nice time?

Yeah, it was great.

Low-key, like I promised.

No hanky-panky, no strippers.
Just the guys telling jokes.

That's nice.

How about you?
Did you have a fun night?

Yeah. We, uh, made gift bags, had wine...

and then went online and saw this.

Of all the "Howard humping hooker" stories...

that one's my favorite.

You know, we're not that far
from my apartment.

If you stop the car, I can walk from here.

You ain't going anywhere, Threeway.

Bernadette, listen...

You lied. You said you told me
about all the girls you've been with...

but you never mentioned
your cousin, the prostitute or Raj.

Seriously, you don't
even have to stop the car.

Anything under 10 miles an hour
and I can combat-roll into the street.

Okay, just to set the record straight...

I didn't hire the prostitute,
she was a gift from him.

Shame on you, Raj. That is not how
we treat women in this country.

Don't you try and blame this on him.

 Thank you.
 Zip it, pervert!

I don't know what I'm gonna do.

I'm supposed to marry Howard
in a couple weeks...

and I'm not sure I even know
who the man is anymore.

I'm curious what's bothering you most...

the borderline incest, the prostitute...

or group sex with the girl
dressed as the children's cartoon.

Remember when we went over things that
would be helpful and things that wouldn't?

Right.

 And that was...?
 Not.

When I first met Howard,
he seemed so innocent to me.

Just a sweet little guy
who lives with his mother.

If that's what you like, I'll take you to the
comic book store. The place is full of them.

Wait a minute.

You set me up with Howard.

Did you know about
all the creepy stuff he was into?

Oh, a little. You hear stuff.

Why didn't you tell me?

I was gonna but I didn't think it
would go past the first date.

When it did, I thought it wouldn't go past
you meeting his mother.

Definitely not past sleeping together.
Warning signs were there.

This is really on you.

My God, I though you were my friend!




I don't think that was helpful.

Hi, Bernie, it's me again.
Please call me back.

Dude, I'm so sorry.

It's not your fault, it's mine.
I did all that stuff, not you.

Actually, you did do
one of them together.

 Here.
 What is this?

You're upset. The convention is to bring
an upset person a hot beverage.

No, but what is it?

Chicken broth.

It seemed culturally appropriate.

There was a single cube of chicken bouillon
in the cupboard when I moved in.

And it's been bothering me
for the last eight years.

So as they say, two birds.

I don't know what my next move is.

Well, Howard, I don't know
much about women.

 Yeah?
 No, that's it.

I don't know much about women.

Raj, you got anything?

I've got the phone number
of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.

I'm not calling the girl from Comic-Con.

All right, more Sailor Moon for me.

I just threw up the bachelor party.

Please come out, Bernadette.
Let's talk through this.

No, leave me alone.

You should give him a taste of his own
medicine. Have a cousin you find attractive?


Amy.

Hey, you introduced her to the sleazebag.
I'm just trying to clean up your mess.

 Oh, hi.
 Hi.

I need to talk to Bernadette.

Well, I don't think she wants to
talk to anyone right now.

All right. Well, could you at least
give her a message?

Yeah, sure, I guess.

Tell her I'm really sorry.

And if she doesn't want to marry me,
I get it.

But what I really want her to know is
that the guy that she's disgusted by...

is the guy that I'm disgusted by too,
but that guy doesn't exist anymore.

He's gone.

And the reason is because of her.

So...

if this relationship is over...

let her know that
she made me a better man...

and tell her thank you.

Oh, my God, Howard.

That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard.

And it came out of you.

Howie.

Penny has a message for you.

I heard.

Your voice, not unlike your mother's,
travels through walls.

Do you want me to go?

No.

Come here.

 I'm still really mad at you.
 I get that.

Anything else about your past
I should know?

Couple of things, but most of them
happened overseas. I'll tell you later.

Okay.

So is the wedding still on?

Yeah, the wedding's still on.


Thank God, I'm still a maid of honor.

Oh, what the hell?

This is kind of hot.

Hello.

What's with the robe?

I'm going to have sex with you right here
right now on that washing machine.

No, you're not.

Come on, please?

You wanna do something,
you can help me fold this sheet.

Folding a sheet in my underwear...

still pretty crazy.



Having a little trouble
catching your breath, there?

No, I'm good. If my P.E. teachers had
told me this is what I was training for...

I would have tried a lot harder.

Do or do not, there is no try.

Heh. Did you just quote Star Wars?

I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.

Ha, ha. Oh, my God.

I am lying in bed with a beautiful woman
who can quote Yoda.

I love you, Penny.

Uh... Heh.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

 I just wanted to put that out there.
 Oh, yeah. No, I...

 I'm glad.
 Yeah... Oh, good.

 Good. Glad is good.
 Yeah.

Ha. Ahem.

No... Um...

So, heh...

It's getting pretty late.
We should, tsk, go to sleep.

 Yeah.
 Okay.

Yeah, probably.

 Okay. Good night, sweetie.
 Good night.

Hey, Leonard,
where do you come down on giant ants?

Sheldon says impossible,
Howard and I say not only possible...

but as a mode of transportation,
way cooler than the Batmobile.

You are ignoring the square-cube law.

The giant ant would be crushed
under the weight of its exoskeleton.

For the record, the appropriate ranking
of cool modes of transportation...

is jetpack, hover board, transporter,
Batmobile and then giant ant.

Seriously, you have nothing better
to do than sit around...

and discuss the possibility
of giant ants?

 What's with him?
 Perhaps he's at a sensitive point...

in his monthly cycle.

Are you saying he's man-struating?

Not literally.

But as far back as the 17th century...

scientists observed a 33-day
fluctuation in men's hormone levels.

Interesting.

That might explain my weepy days
in the middle of the month.

You know what I'm talking about.

Okay, forget giant ants.

How about giant rabbits?

Big or small, I don't like rabbits.

They always look like they're about
to say something, but they never do.

Rabbits do have a respiratory system
that would support great size.

On a side note,
they are one of the few mammals...

whose scrotum
is in front of the penis.

Maybe that's
what they wanna talk about.

Leonard, where do you stand
on giant rabbits and scrotal position?

I honestly don't care.

Really? Every time we've talked
about unusual animal genitals...

you've always had some pretty strong
and controversial opinions.

What do you want?
I just don't give a rat's ass.

Would that be a giant rat's ass?

For the record, giant rats are possible.

Can we please talk
about something else?

Maybe something vaguely related
to life as we know it on this planet?

Okay, how about this for a topic:
"Why is Leonard being a giant douche?"

Assuming giant douches are possible.

Of course they are.
Leonard's being one.

 Maybe he's having a spat with Penny.
 No. There was no spat.

 Oh, but something happened.
 I don't wanna talk about it.

But I sense you're going to and
I don't wanna hear about it. Excuse me.

What'd you do, Romeo?

Did you pour maple syrup
all over your body...

and ask her if she was in the mood
for a short stack?

Think it would be funny
to put on her panties and jump around...

but it wound up
just creeping her out?

 What? No.
 Just asking, dude.

It happens.

You guys still on for bowling tonight?

Oh, yes. In fact, I've prepared
some trash talk for the occasion. Ahem.

You bowl like your mama.

Unless she bowls well.
In which case, you bowl nothing like her.

Oh. Ouch.

That is what is referred to
as "a burn on you."

 Did you ask her to start waxing?
 No.

 Did you start waxing?
 No.

While making love,
did you accidentally spank your own ass...

and cry out, "Mommy"

I'm walking away from you now.

 That wasn't a no.
 Yeah. Think we're getting close.

Did you take a Benadryl
and fall asleep while pleasuring her?

Because you can die that way.

Oh, that would be a good way to go.

 Hi.
 Oh, hey.

Good, Penny.
Reminder, bowling tonight at 7:00.

Oh, right. Bowling.

You don't have to come
if you don't want.

No, no, it's okay. I mean, let's face it,
you would get creamed without me.

We would indeed.
In this particular case...

your lack of femininity
works to our advantage.

Yeah. It's always nice chatting with you,
Sheldon.

 Sarcasm?
 Thinly veiled contempt.

 Remember, 7:00.
 Got it.

 Pacific Daylight Time.
 Bite me.

Please reserve that butch spirit
for the lanes.

I thought you were bringing
your own bowling shoes.

These are my own bowling shoes.

Then what's with the disinfectant?

I know where my feet have been.

Hey, Penny.

And you guys.

Albino Bob couldn't make it,
so I brought a substitute.

I believe some of you
know Wil Wheaton.

Hi, Sheldon. How's it going?

Well, well, well,
if it isn't Wil Wheaton.

The Green Goblin to my Spider-Man.

The Pope Paul V to my Galileo.

The Internet Explorer to my Firefox.

Not carrying a grudge because I beat you
at that card tournament, are you?

I'm the proud owner
of Wil-Wheaton-stinks.com...

dot-net and dot-org.
What does that tell you?

It tells me that I am living rent-free
right here.

 You ready to bowl?
 Oh, I'm ready.

I don't know if Stuart told you
what you're up against...

but before you stands the co-captain
of the East Texas Christian Youth...

Holy Roller Bowling League
Championship team.

Seven-to-12-year-old division.

Also, Penny's pretty good.

Great. Then it's on.

Foolish Wil Wheaton.

It was never off.

Yes!

A common spare.

The Miss Congeniality
of the bowling pageant.

Before you jump on Twitter
to tout your modest accomplishment...

watch how it's really done.

I am the ball.

My thoughts are its thoughts.

Its holes are my holes.

Yes.

Tweet that, Tweety Bird.

 I just wanted to tell you I'm a big fan.
 Oh, thanks.

I'm sure you're probably sick
of Star Trek questions...

but Whoopi Goldberg,
you ever hit that?

Ah. Beer.

The magic elixir that can turn this poor,
shy Indian boy into the life of the party.

Oh, yeah.

 Chili-cheese fry?
 Yes. I love chili-cheese fries.

 Really? You love them?
 Yeah, why?

No reason. Just glad to hear...

you're comfortable
saying you love something.

 You wanna get into this right now?
 Get into what?

Why wouldn't you love
the chili-cheese fries?

They've been in your life a long time.

They make you happy.
They deserve to know.

Okay, look, you caught me by surprise
last night. I didn't know what to say.

Now you've had time to think about it.
What do you wanna say?

 I'm not sure.
 How can you not be sure?

 This isn't the place to have this.
 No.

The place was in bed after I said,
"I love you"...

and you said,
"Thank you. Good night."

 Don't push it, Leonard.
 I am not pushing anything.

You are. You don't get to decide
when I'm ready to say "I love you."

Ah. The premature "I love you."

I guessed premature. Does that count?

Penny.

Penny.

Penny.

 What?
 This is for you.

 Ice cream?
 I've been familiarizing myself...

with female emotional crises
by studying the comic strip "Cathy."

When she's upset,
she says "ack" and eats ice cream.

Um...

Ack.

And if you were a cat,
I would have brought you a lasagna.

Did Leonard send you over here?

No. We haven't spoken
since your abrupt departure last night...

caused us to forfeit to Stuart
and his dastardly ringer, Wil Wheaton.

Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

Not too proud to admit
that I cried myself to sleep.

 Again, I'm sorry.
 Let me tell you...

sleep did not come easily...

with Leonard in the next room
singing along with Alanis Morissette.

 You're kidding.
 No.

Clearly another woman
in dire need of ice cream.

What part of this is supposed
to make me feel better?

The part where I tell you
I've engineered a rematch...

with Stuart's team for tonight.

Oh, honey, I don't know. Things
are a little weird with Leonard right now.

You want me to remove him from the team?
I'm the captain, I can do that.

No, no, that's okay. Just let me
talk to him and I'll get back to you.

 When are you going to talk to him?
 I don't know.

He's in the laundry room now.
Now would be a good time.

You're not gonna leave me
until I do it?

Oh, I think we both know
the answer to that question.

 I think we should talk now.
 What? No, it's okay.

We don't have to talk because
there's nothing to talk about.

 Everything's good.
 Really?

So you didn't get snarky...

because I said something nice
to a bowl of chili fries?

All right, maybe I overreacted.

So we're in two different places,
emotionally. So what?

And maybe I'm a little ahead of you,
and that's fine.

In fact, it makes sense,
because let's face it...

I've been in this relationship
two years longer than you.

Look, Leonard, you have to know
how much I care about you.

It's just that I've said the L word
too soon before...

and it didn't work out very well.

Really?
I wouldn't know what that's like.

I'm sorry.

 You know what I'm talking about.
 Yeah, I do.

 So we're good?
 Yes, that's what I'm telling you.

We are good. We are great.

All right. Fence mended,
problem swept under the rug.

Time to bowl.

Yes, I was eavesdropping.
There's a lot at stake.

Attention, all bowlers...

I've taken the liberty
of having these made for our rematch.

 The Wesley Crushers?
 No, not the Wesley Crushers.

The Wesley "Crushers."

 I don't get it.
 Wesley Crusher...

was Wil Wheaton's character
on Star Trek.

Still don't get it.

It's a blindingly clever play on words.

By appropriating his character's
name and adding the S...

we imply that we will be
the crushers of Wesley.

I'm sorry, but the Wesley Crushers...

sounds like people
who like Wesley Crusher.

No, again,
it's not the Wesley Crushers.

It's the Wesley "Crushers."

No, if you want it to mean
you're crushing Wesley...

it'd be the "Wesley" Crushers.

Do you people even hear yourselves?
It's not the Wesley Crushers.

It's not the "Wesley" Crushers,
it's Wesley "Crushers."

Hey, look.
They named their team after me.

No, it's not... Never mind.

So we're all clear on the bet
and the stakes?

Oh, yes.

The losers will be publicly humiliated
in a fashion to be chosen by the victor.

FYI, I plan on having you
publish a scientific paper...

expounding the discredited
Belakovsky hypotheses.

Ouch again.

Hey, Sheldon.

I wanted you to know I'm looking forward
to wiping the floor with you.

Oh, yes? Well, before I respond,
let me ask you a question.

Is your mother a good or poor bowler?

 After you.
 No, after you.

As we are currently crushing you,
Wesley.

It's customary for the player
on the right-hand lane to bowl first.

All right.

It's a custom, not a rule.

I so loathe you.

That's right, Sheldon.
Embrace the dark side.

That's not even from your franchise.

I, um... I want you to know that
even though we're on opposite sides...

I bear you no ill will.

 Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.
 Mm-hm.

People from opposite sides
often have good relationships.

You know, Romeo and Juliet...

Tony and Maria from West Side Story.

What's-his-name
and the big, blue chick in Avatar.

I'm gonna bowl now.

Be the ball, Howard.

Leave me alone, Sheldon.

You weren't the ball.

Hey, thanks.

 This is fun, huh?
 Yeah.

It's good we got out
and did something physical.

 Mm-hm.
 Gets us out of our heads.

You get in your head...

you start to over-think, over-analyze,
obsess, you worry.

That's not what we're doing tonight.
We're throwing a ball at some pins.

 Yeah, that's right.
 Mm-hm.

And someday, we don't know when,
maybe you'll love me back.

Ooh. I'm up.

Sheldon. Sheldon. Sheldon.

Excuse me.

I don't know who you're chanting for,
as I am currently the ball.

The ball. The ball. The ball.

Thank you, Jesus!

As my mother would say.

I'm glad you patched things up
with your boyfriend.

Yeah, me too.

It's tough when the L bomb
gets dropped and you're not ready.

Tell me about it.

I dated this one girl,
and I told her that I loved her...

and she said she wasn't sure.

And she strung me along
for almost two years. It was brutal.

 Oh, I'm sorry.
 Thanks.

I wish she had just broken up with me
right there.

Put me out of my misery.

 Really?
 Yeah. Would have been kinder.

 Wil, you're up.
 Oh, that's me.

Did you let Wil Wheaton
get in your head?

 What are you talking about?
 He's evil.

He plays evil mind games.

 Did he tell you his grandmother died?
 No.

If he does, don't believe it. He's not above
playing the dead meemaw card.

Yes!

Enjoy the accolades now,
Wil Wheaton.

But like your time on
Star Trek: Next Generation...

your smug self-satisfaction
will be short-lived.

 Penny, you're up.
 All right, remember...

 ...his meemaw's alive and be the ball.
 Yeah. I got it.

 Oh, we really need a strike here.
 I know.

 Take your time and concentrate.
 Leonard, stop pressuring me.

 I'm not pressuring you.
 You are. Just back off.

Okay. I'm sorry. I'll shut up.

I didn't mean shut up.

Fine.

Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.

No. This isn't fair to you, Leonard.
I'm sorry.

Wait, where are you going?
Penny, come back.

I'll get you ice cream.

 No, let her go.
 Are you insane?

If she leaves, it's over.

Pretty sure it's already over.

Tough luck, Sheldon.

You did this, didn't you?

Do you think I would break up a couple
just to win a bowling match?

 No, I suppose not.
 Good. Keep thinking that.

Wheaton...

Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yep.

I'm telling you, the Match.com chicks
are much looser than on eHarmony.

Oh. You know, I gotta call you back.
I won a bet and it's time to collect.

I don't know about you,
but I feel empowered.



You know who's got to be
the bravest person

in the Marvel Universe?

Whoever has to give
She-Hulk a bikini wax.

You want to talk brave,

how about Captain America's
undocumented Mexican gardener?

He's not braver than

whoever uses the bathroom
after The Thing?

As usual, you're all wrong.

The bravest person
in the Marvel Universe

is the doctor who gives
Wolverine his prostate exam.

How about the guy who gets

a prostate exam from Wolverine?

Now you're just being silly.

Wolverine's never displayed

the slightest interest
in helping others

prevent prostate cancer.

Hello.

Yes, the elevator's
out of order;

you'll have to use the stairs.

Of course you can.

Pizza dates back
to the 16th century,

while the first elevator
was not installed until 1852.

That means that
for over 300 years,

people carried pizzas up stairs.

Be part of that proud tradition.

I'll go get Penny while that guy
spits on our food.

Do you think they gave Wolverine
an adamantium prostate?

That's a stupid question.

We're having
a conversation about

probing the heinies
of superheroes.

There are no stupid questions.

Yes?

Oh, um, is
Penny here?

You're Leonard, right?

Yeah.

Damn, it's good
to finally meet you, son.

Okay, I think a bit of
context here might help.

Oh, hey, Leonard.
I see you met my dad.

Oh, good.

Context.

Come on in, buddy.

Take a load off.

Oh, gee, Dad,
Leonard can't stay.

He just dropped by to say hello.

Thanks for stopping by, sweetie.

I'll see you later.

Bye.

That was odd.

 


Are you sure you have
enough comics?

You're going to be monitoring
the telescope for 12 hours,

and by my estimate,
you've only selected

seven hours of reading material.

That's even factoring in

your difficulty in parsing
American comic book idioms

like "Bamf!" and "Snikt!"

Is that racist?

It feels racist.

Don't be oversensitive.

He's calling you illiterate,
not your race.

Oh, okay. Good.

I don't need
more comics.

Howard's gonna stop by,
we're gonna play

Intergalactic Battleship
and Indian Monopoly.

I don't care for
novelty editions of Monopoly.

I prefer the classics:
regular and Klingon.

Actually, Indian Monopoly's

just like regular,
except the money's in rupees,

instead of hotels
you build call centers,

and when you pick a Chance card,
you might die of dysentery.

Just FYI,

that was racist.

You'll never guess
what just happened.

You went out in the hallway,

stumbled into
an interdimensional portal

which brought you 5,000 years
into the future,

where you took advantage
of the advanced technology

to build a time machine,
and now you're back

to bring us all with you
to the year 7010

where we are transported
to work at the Thinkatorium

by telepathically controlled
flying dolphins?

No.

Aw.

Penny kissed me.

Well, who would ever guess that?

What-what kind of a kiss?

A big kiss. On the mouth.

Is it possible that she was
going for your cheek

and you moved
and she accidentally got lip?

That happens with me and my mom
all the time.

She introduced me to her father,

kissed me and then
shut the door in my face.

Maybe she was trying
to send you a message.

You think?

Yeah.
"This man is not my father.

"I'm being held hostage.

"So I'm going to do

"something insane in the hopes

that you'll call 911."

Penny kissing me is not insane.

She used to kiss me
all the time.

Einstein defined insanity
as "doing the same thing

over and over again and
expecting different results."

By that standard,

Penny is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

I'm just saying,

it felt like it may have
meant something.

Ah, this takes me back.

Leonard obsessing about Penny.

I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love your new stuff,

but once in a while
it's nice to hear the hits.

Ooh, ooh!

Do "Our babies will be smart
and beautiful."

That one always makes me laugh.

Why do I bother
talking to you people?

If it'll make you feel better,
we rarely listen.

Hey, can I talk to you
out here for a sec?

Yeah, sure.

I'm starting to think we're
never going to see that pizza.

So you're probably wondering
what that was all about.

What, uh, the kissing
and everything?

Nah, women do that to me
all the time.

Yeah, okay.
The thing is, I kind of

told my father
we got back together again.

What? Why?

Well, you're the first guy

he's ever really approved of,
you know?

You're a scientist
who went to college

and you don't have a neck tattoo

or outstanding warrants
or... or a baby.

What kind of guys
did you used to go out with?

Just guys.

Anyway, when I told him
we split up, he was heartbroken,

and he kept bugging me:
"How's Leonard?

"Why can't you get
back together with Leonard?

I bet Leonard never
tipped a cow over on himself."

So to get him off my back,

I told him
we worked things out.

Really?

How-how'd we manage that?

What?

I mean, did you apologize?

Did you have to woo me?

Get over yourself.

I whistled, you came running.

Yeah, no, I don't think so.

Okay, why are you
arguing about this?

I'm just saying,

if we fake got back together,

that's totally not
how it fake happened.

Oh...

Okay, whatever.

Will you please just play along
until my dad leaves?

Hold on, you actually want me

to deceive your father
with some sort of

sham play acting and kissing?

'Cause I'm good with that.

Penny, you out here?

Come on, honey,
not in front of my dad.

Relax, I've seen you do
a lot worse with a lot stupider.

See?

He doesn't mind.

So, Leonard,
I'm taking your gal out

for a steak dinner;
you want to join us?

Oh, Dad, that's nice,
but Leonard has to work.

Right, Leonard?

Uh, I do, I
have to work.

But I'm gonna blow that
off to spend the evening

with my sweetie and her
father, 'cause, you know,

just the kind of
boyfriend I am.

Oh.

Come here, you.

C-7.

Miss.

How could that be a miss?

C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit.

Part of your starship
has to be on C-7.

Not if it has a hole
in the middle.

What kind of spaceship
has a hole in the middle?

A Romulan Battle Bagel?

Knock-knock.

Oh, great, you made it.

Come on in.

I invited her.

So where's
the telescope?

It's in Hawaii, but Raj
controls it from here.

He's hoping to see Epsilon
Eridani dim, which would be

evidence of a planet
orbiting it.

So we just sit and stare
at the screen,

waiting for
something to happen?

I did it with you when
we rented The Notebook.

Yes, Gena Rowlands
is a treasure.

You'd better open up
that bottle of wine

or I'm gonna end up
with swimmer's ear.

Excuse me.

I can't be drinking,
I'm about to make

an important scientific
discovery here.

What? Galileo did his best work
while drinking wine.

How do you know that?

Well, he was Italian.

It's a reasonable assumption.

Dude, can you even
open your mouth

without spewing a
cultural stereotype?

Oh, I-I'm sorry,
Galileo drank Diet Sprite.

Look, you're my best friend,
she's my girlfriend;

you should bond.

You know,
like you and my mom did.

Your mom creeps
the hell out of me.

Yes, but she's stopped
calling you Slumdog Millionaire.

I do appreciate that.

Here we go.

I'd like to propose a toast.

To science and friendship.

Hold on. Wait.

No, it's okay, go ahead.

What?

Oh, I was working with

penicillin-resistant gonorrhea
in the lab today

and I was just trying to
remember if I washed my hands.

Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.

My pleasure.

It's nice to have dinner
with a boyfriend of Penny's

that knows how to use a napkin.

So not funny, Dad.

Let me tell you about this one
genius she was going out with,

this-this
fella Donnie.

Oh, will you please let it go?

Donnie was gonna make millions
turning farm waste

into biofuel and selling it
to the government.

A lot of people are doing that.

Oh, see?

Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix
pig poop with a little water

and pump it
into his mom's Camry.

Yeah, that's great.

It's a funny story. Moving on.

And Donnie was a rocket
scientist compared to that boy

who wanted to get beer pong
into the Olympics.

What was his
name, sweetheart?

Curtis, and I'm pretty sure
he was joking.

I don't know.

That petition
looked real to me.

Yeah, okay, I think this ends

the ex-boyfriend portion
of our evening.

Well, I'm just glad you finally
found yourself a keeper.

Thanks, Wyatt.

I'm a keeper.

Leonard, you want to come in
for a nightcap?

Oh, gee, Dad,
he'd love to,

but Leonard has to work
in the morning.

Maybe I could
go in a little late.

No, no, no, you can't.

Your career is
far too important.

Behind every great man
is a nagging woman

who won't let him have any fun,
am I right, Leonard?

Don't I know it.

Well, good night, son.

Good night, Wyatt.

Oh, good
night, honey.

Good night.

I love you.

Love you, too.

Oh, friggety-frak.

Not this again.

Three, four, five--
pass go, get 2,000 rupees--

six, seven.

Whoops. Can't go any further.
There's a sacred cow in my way.

Bernadette, please
tell your boyfriend

to cool it with
the cow jokes.

It won't help.

Once he finds a joke he likes,
he sticks with it.

Yeah.

Like his haircut material.

Oh, right.
Did you get your hair cut?

"No. I got them all cut."

Which is still
so funny.

And when you go
to a Chinese restaurant,

he always gets the same fortune
in his fortune cookie.

Right. "Help, I'm a prisoner

in a Chinese
fortune cookie factory."

Okay, I think that's enough
about me.

He's right. Let's make
fun of his mother.

"Howard, come rub my feet!

My corns are killing me!"

"Howard, help me
out of the tub!

I'm stuck again!"

Coming.

Hey, lovebug.

Shut up.

You know what I've been doing
for the last hour?

Mm, dreamily doodling
"Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter"

in a notebook?

Listening to my father
go on and on

about what a great guy you are.

You got to admit,
I am... I'm delightful.

Why are you making this
so difficult?

It's not difficult for me.

I'm having fun.

Leonard.

What do you want me to do?
You started this.

Do you want to go over
and tell him we're broken up?

No.
Well, then, what do you want?

I don't know.

Don't you think that's something
you should

have figured out
before you stomped over here?

Maybe.

Leonard, Penny, excellent.

I'd like to say I'm very happy
that you're back together,

and if I can figure out
a way to do so

and sound sincere, I will.

In the meantime,

I'd like to go over
some proposed changes

to the roommate agreement
specifically to address

Penny's annoying
personal habits.

Oh, my God.

What personal habits?
I have a list.

FYI, overuse of the phrase
"Oh, my God" is number 12.

Okay, Sheldon,
you don't have to do this

because Leonard and I are not...
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

Are you sure you want
to include him in this?

Include me in what?

Is there a plot afoot?

I'll have no
truck with plots.

No, you're right.

No, there's... there's no plots,
no trucks, no feet.

So what other annoying habits
shall we discuss?

Uh, we don't
discuss anything.

Leonard is the signatory
to the roommate agreement.

As such, he bears
responsibility

for all your infractions
and must pay all fines.

Fines?
Yes.

If Penny's going to be
spending nights here again,

you'll need to set up
an escrow account.

Sign here.

Hello, Hawaii.

This is Dr. Koothrappali
in Pasadena.

I'd like you to reposition
the telescope, please.

Scarlett Johansson's house!

I'm kidding, Hawaii.

Mahalo.

Whoo!

It might have
been a mistake

to open that second
bottle of wine.

Well, live and learn.

So, Raj, do you think this
planet you're looking for

could have an atmosphere
that supports life?

Maybe.

If it did, I'd be famous.

I'd be on the cover
of magazines.

And then,
instead of living alone

in my tiny apartment,
I'd have a big mansion.

That sounds great.

It is.

If you like wandering
around a big, empty house

with no one to love you.

We'd come visit you.
No, you wouldn't.

You'd be intimidated
by my wealth and fame.

My only friends would be

my genetically engineered
monkey butler

and the little people I hired
to be my living chess set.

He's taking a turn to
the dark side, isn't he?

Hold on.
He could come back.

Oh, what's the point
of everything?

Nope. He's gone.

You know it's been more
than a year

since I've even kissed a girl?

What about that hookup
at Comic-Con you told me about?

Oh, grow up. I was lying.

I lie all the time.
Nobody wants to kiss me.

Oh, you poor, poor thing.

Raj, you have to know
you're a wonderful man.

There are a lot of girls out
there who'll want to kiss you.

Where?

You just have to look.

No!

Well, this was fun.

Oh! I think
I got a nibble.

Oh, be careful.

Give him some line.

Okay, now reel him in.

Oh, look at that baby.

They're really biting, huh?

Yeah. They do that
when you set it on easy.

Oh, that's me.

Hello.

Oh, hi, sweetie.

Yeah, I got up early
and didn't want to wake you,

so I went out for coffee and ran
into Leonard on the way back.

Guess what-- we're fishing.

Yeah. Right here on his couch.

Hey, baby. I love you!

That's Leonard.

Says he loves you.

What?

I see.

The whole thing's
bull squirt, huh?

Well, that's very disappointing.

Bye.

Oh, hey.

There's been something I've
been meaning to tell you.

I can't believe you would
lie to me like that.

Just for the record, I did not
want to be a part of this.

I'll get to you in a minute.

No hurry.

That my own daughter thinks
I don't love her enough

to support her no matter
what choices she makes--

well, that hurts me deeply.

I'm sorry, Daddy...
Let me finish.

Oh.

I thought we were
past the days

when you would try
to pull the wool over my eyes.

Telling me the baggie in your
underwear drawer is potpourri?

And the pee stick
in your bathroom

is to check for diabetes?

You know, I'm sorry.

You're a grown woman,
and I respect your right

to make your own decisions,
but all I ask

is you respect me enough
to be honest about them.

You're right. Look, from now on,
I will tell you the truth.

Thank you. Now, why don't you go
and put some clothes on

and we'll grab a bite to eat
before I head for the airport.

 Now you.
 Daddy, he had nothing to do...

 Keep walking.
 Okay.

Please, please, please
don't give up on her.

What?

I can't go back to the
skateboard idiots,

the white rappers
and all those

sweaty dumb-asses with
their backwards hats.

Gee, I don't know
if it's in the cards, sir.

Then, stack the deck.

Cheat.

Lie. I don't care.

I want grandkids before I die,

and I want them to grow up
in a house without wheels.

I'll give it a shot.

Thank you.

Now I'm going to do something
here to help you along.

Excuse me?
Just don't panic.

Now, get your sorry,
lying ass out of my face

and make sure I
never see it again!

Oh, the reverse psychology
thing.

I see. That's very clever.

Don't yap. Just get out.

I'll friend you on Facebook.

Oh, there you are.

Just so you know,
I was up all night,

but I have finally completed

the Penny-specific section
of the new roommate agreement.

Yeah, well, not necessary.

We broke up again.

Do you even think
about other people, Leonard?

Do you?

 Hey.
 Oh, how'd it go last night?

Oh, you know.

Same old, same old.

Looked through a telescope,
saw some stars.

Big whoop.

Really?

You waited months
for time with that telescope.

What happened?

Why? You writing a book?

I'm going to propose
a hypothesis.

Last night,
Raj accidentally made contact

with an alien civilization

and has been ordered
by the United States government

to keep it a secret.

Nothing happened.

Can we please just
change the subject?

That sounds rehearsed.

We are not alone.

Hey.

Hey.
Hello.

Hey.
Hey.

You get to play with
Raj's big telescope last night?

Whoa.

Where did that come from?

He never touched my telescope.

Way to go shutting up.

I did shut up. Now you shut up.

Fine.
Thank you.


I can't believe
you didn't call me this morning.


Wow, Sheldon, cannot believe
you made up your own game.

Oh. Research Lab is more than a game.

It's like the slogan says:

"The physics is theoretical,
but the fun is real."

We must not be playing it right.

All right. Five.
One, two, three, four, five.

Oh, wow, look at that.

My Department of Defense
research grant is renewed.

Oh. Great roll.

Now you can demolish
your Soviet-style cyclotron...

and build the large hadron collider.

Yay.

You're a natural at this, Penny.

And as the first beta testers,
you two have quite the edge...

when we play with Wolowitz
and Koothrappali on Sunday.

Oh, gee, Sheldon,
I don't think we can play on Sunday.

Why not?

Because of the reasons
that Penny will now tell you. Penny?

I have to pick up my friend Justin
from the airport.

There you go.
She has to pick up her friend Justin.

And I can't play
because I'm going with her. Right?

Uh, yeah, if you want.
There may not be room.

He's got a lot of stuff, like guitars
and amplifiers.

Wait. What are you talking about?

My friend Justin.

Pay attention, Leonard.
That's why she can't play on Sunday.

 Who is this Justin?
 Your turn.

 I told you about him.
 Roll the dice.

Yeah. My friend from Omaha,
plays the guitar.

He's coming
looking for session work.

So I told him
he could crash on my couch.

Come on. Roll a six, Penny dies horribly
in a nuclear meltdown.

See what I mean
when I say the fun is real?

Hang on. Some guy
is gonna be sleeping on your couch?

He's not some guy. He's my friend.

So by friend, do you mean
"friend" friend...

gay friend, or "ex-boyfriend
you're now platonic with...

but still might have a thing for you"
friend?

Well, he's definitely not gay.

Oh. A definitely-not-gay musician
sleeping on my girlfriend's couch.

Yippie.

Okay, we went out a little bit
a long time ago.

But we were never, like, going out.

Okay. Not to be pedantic,
the last I checked...

"went out" was the past tense
of "going out"...

which I think we all know
is a popular euphemism...

for saw each other naked.

I'll just roll for you.

You have a problem
with Justin staying with me?

What was your first clue?

Uh-oh. Industrial accident.

Know what?
Don't talk to me like an idiot.

I'm not talking to you like an idiot.
I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic.

"You accidentally stare at a helium-argon
laser. Lose one turn and a retina."

How's that not talking to me
like I'm an idiot?

It's my friend, it's my couch
and it's my freaking life.

It's also your roll.

You know what? It is your life.

If you wanna have some stupid guitarist
stay on your couch, fine!

Why don't you just rent bunk beds
and invite the Black Eyed Peas?

Hey, if I wanna invite the line-up
of Lollapalooza to my apartment, I will.

It's none of your business.

Do you know how childish you sound
right now?

 Oh, now I'm a child. Not an idiot anymore.
 Hey, the two aren't mutually exclusive.

Oh, you are such a...

 What the hell is he doing?
 Drowning us out. He doesn't like fighting.

Sheldon, just stop.
Look, the fight is over.

Oh, and FYI. You never even heard
of the Black Eyed Peas...

until you met me.

I heard of them.

I didn't know they were a band.

Sheldon, she's gone.
You can turn off the blender.

Has your relationship reached
its inevitable ugly end?

No, we just had a little spat.

Look on the bright side.
As a result of Penny's forfeit...

you have become
the world's first winner of Research Lab.

Would you like a commemorative
snow cone?

I don't get how she can just announce...

that an old boyfriend is gonna sleep
on her couch.

Hey, I thought of a game
we can play in the car.

I don't wanna play a game, Sheldon.

It's called Scientists.
Now, I will name three scientists...

you'll put them in order of the size
of their contribution to their fields.

To make this game
even more compelling...

you must consider only the
contribution of the man to the field...

not the validity of the field itself.

For example,
Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan...

made a greater contribution
to the discredited field of alchemy...

than Halbert Vanderplatt
made to neurobiology.

Okay. Ready to have some fun?

An old boyfriend
who's "definitely not gay."

You know, that's what a guy
likes to hear. "Definitely."

All right, I'll start with an easy one.

Um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie
and Niels Bohr.

And then I say one little thing
and I end up being the bad guy.

Hint. Madame Curie had her husband
to help her.

What am I supposed to say?

"Sure, Penny. I'm cool with your old
boyfriend sleeping in your apartment."

"It doesn't matter if you're cool or not.

Because I'm Penny, I'm pretty
and I can do whatever I want."

"You think you're doing
a favor by being in a relationship with me."

"No. I'm doing you
a favor by being in the same room as you."

Leonard, stop the car.

What?

I can't listen to the two of you fight
anymore.

 Come on. We're late.
 Calm down. We'll make the movie.

I believe my alarm is appropriate.
The movie starts in 17 minutes.

We'll need to make all the lights
on Colorado Boulevard.

Plus, skip the concession stand
and pre-show urination.

Oh, dude, I wish you had said something
before I pounded that last Red Bull.

Go. Go, Power Rangers, go.

 Hey.
 Hey.

 We're, uh, going to the movies.
 No, we're not.

We're standing in the hallway,
suffering through an awkward encounter.

Hang on.

They're showing a digital Time Bandits.
You wouldn't wanna come, would you?

Not really, no.

All right. Invitation pointlessly offered,
declined as expected.

Everyone's civil, nobody's fighting.
Have a nice evening.

Just give us a minute?

Take all the time you need.

So are we gonna talk about last night?

 Are you ready to apologize?
 No.

Ehh! Wrong answer.
But thank you for playing.

Come on. This is stupid.

Oh, there it is again.
You think I'm stupid.

No. There's a difference
between being and acting stupid.

Oh, yeah? Well, there's a difference
between being a jerk and being an ass.

No, there isn't. They're synonyms.

Well, that was rather unpleasant.

Yeah. I don't think I need
my pre-show urination anymore.

Leonard, when that woman moved in
three years ago...

I told you not to talk to her.
Now look, we are late for the movies.

Hey, look Amazing Spider-Man 193.

Got it.

Remember this one?
Spider-Man loses a big fight...

and then his girlfriend breaks up
with him.

You want me to get it for you?
It will help take your mind off things.

Hey, guys. What's going on?

Ah, we need to kill a couple hours
until the next showing.

Oh, well, no problem.

I was thinking of closing early,
and going home...

but let's face it, that's just a smaller
lonely room filled with comic books.

Thanks, Stuart.

Let me ask you.

Do you think it's okay to have
an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?

 She's obviously way out of line.
 Thank you.

But if she dumps you,
she'll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow...

and you'll have a new girlfriend
when you figure out how to build one.

So the only question is,
how long until you fold?

I am not gonna fold.

Well, excuse me. I don't think
Penny's out of line. You don't own her.

It's like my girl Beyonc� says:

"If you like it,
you should've put a ring on it."

At the very least, when she found out
Leonard was upset about it...

 ...she should've backed off.
 Like when a guy's upset...

his friend agreed to take a class
with him and then doesn't...

because he's doing a juice fast
with his mother?

I didn't know you were upset
about that.

Really? Did you miss the subtle indicators?
Like me saying, "Howard, I am upset."

 Okay, sorry.
 Maybe it's different in this country.

Back in India, it means you're upset
with a guy named Howard.

 I said I'm sorry.
 Sorry doesn't make up for the fact...

I had to make chicken and rice
with this vegan guy.

Do you know
what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice.

You think I was having fun? Sitting
around listening to my mother say:

"Have you ever
peed so much in your life?"

Oh, my God.
You are such a mama's boy.

 Don't bring my mother into this!
 You brought your mother into this!

Stop it! Both of you!

This fighting, I might as well be back
with my parents.

"I told you if you didn't
quit drinking, I'd leave you."

"I guess that makes you a liar.
I'm drunk as hell and you're still here."

"Stop yelling.
You're making Sheldon cry."

"I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry.

That I let you name him Sheldon."

Boy, what got him so upset?

Oh, sure. You can tell
when Sheldon's upset.

Oh. Thank you very much.
Come back soon.

With the other half of my tip.

Hey, Sheldon.
What're you doing here?

This is a restaurant. It's lunchtime.

I'd think as a waitress you'd be familiar
with the paradigm.

 Is Leonard coming?
 No.

I believe Leonard is waiting for you
to come back to him and apologize.

 Well, that's not gonna happen.
 I assumed that.

 Hence my true purpose in coming here.
 Which is?

I want you to crawl back to him
and apologize.

 I'm busy.
 Excuse me, miss. I'd like to order lunch.

 Fine. What do you want?
 I have a few questions.

First, I notice that you offer
soup and a half sandwich.

 Yes.
 Where exactly...

does the half-sandwich come from?

Are you giving me half
of someone else's sandwich?

Or do I have to wait for someone else
to order the other half?

No. Sheldon, they just make
a half sandwich.

You can't make a half sandwich.

If it's not half of a whole sandwich,
it's just a small sandwich.

Okay, fine.
It's soup and a small sandwich.

 Is that what you want?
 Of course not. I'll have my usual.

 Great.
 Aren't you gonna ask...

 ...if I want a beverage?
 Usually lemonade?

 Yes.
 Want lemonade?

 Yes.
 Anything else?

Yes. I want you to apologize to Leonard.

I am not going to apologize.
I've done nothing. He's overreacting.

Irrelevant. The disruption in your
relationship is making my life intolerable.

Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon,
but this really isn't about you.

I don't follow.

Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right there.
Look, Sheldon, I have to go.

All right. Let's assume ad arguendum,
that in this case Leonard is wrong.

 Leonard is wrong.
 Considering the transgressions...

you committed
that he's overlooked...

don't you think that
you could return the favor?

I'm coming. Goodbye, Sheldon.

What do you mean
transgressions I've committed?

Were you under the impression that
Leonard has no complaints about you?

Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you.

You're making a check sign in the air.
Got it. Just hold your horses.

 What does Leonard complain about?
 Your driving.

The stuffed animals on your bed...

that stare at him
during your amorous activities.

Your constant tardiness, your singing.

 My singing?
 That's from my list.

Leonard'd be a fool
if he didn't agree with it.

Okay, if Leonard has problems with me,
why hasn't he just said so?

According to him, you're over-sensitive
and have a temper.

Oh, really? Well, then do me a favor
and tell Leonard that he can drop dead.

And she wonders
why she's constantly under-tipped.

 Hey.
 Oh, good, you're home.

 I need you to do me a favor.
 Sure.

 Go apologize to Penny.
 What?

Right now would be good.

 Leonard!
 A few minutes ago would've been better.

I hear you don't like my stuffed animals,
my driving or my punctuality.

Who would tell you
something like that?

Why would you tell her
something like that?

It doesn't matter why he told me.
It's true, isn't it?

Okay, yeah, it's true.
But I can live with that stuff.

What I can't live with
is you casually informing me...

some guy is gonna be staying
without asking me first.

That isn't even your problem.
Problem is you don't trust me.

Oh, come on.

Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say
that I don't trust Penny?

Sheldon? Where did he go?

Ugh. Your yelling must've
freaked him out again.

Where are you going? You just walk away
in the middle of an argument?

No. I'm gonna find your roommate...

before he hurts himself
trying to cross the street or something.

Why didn't you say so?

Now I need your permission
for that too?

I can't read your mind, Penny.

Really? Why not?
You're so smart and I'm so dumb!

Raj. Raj. Raj.

Stop knocking. It's open.

Please tell my parents
that our dark matter research...

is at a critical juncture. I can't come
for my cousin Sanjay's wedding.

Ask our son what we're supposed
to say to Mr. and Mrs. Chaudri...

whose daughter, Lakshmi, Is flying In
for the sole purpose of meeting him.

I didn't ask you to set me up.

 You should be thanking us.
 Yes, Lakshmi got her stomach stapled.

You have an opportunity
to get in with her...

before she loses weight
and her self-esteem goes up.

I don't care.

And why don't you think
I can find a woman for myself?

You're 27, the closest thing
we have...

to a daughter-in-law
Is that Jewish boy, Howard.

Oh, that is completely below the belt.

Sheldon, tell my parents
that Howard and I are just friends.

Sheldon?

Howard and I are just friends.

Fine. I'll come home
for Sanjay's wedding.

Sheldon.

What are you doing?
He's not a lost dog.

Hey, why don't you just let me find him...

while you sit there
hitting your imaginary brake?

The brake might be imaginary,
but that stop sign you just ran wasn't.

 What stop sign?
 Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!

Howard, answer the door! I'm busy!

I'm busy too! You answer it!

I can't! I'm on the toilet!

God's sake, I don't need to hear that!

Can't you just say, "I'm busy?"

I said, "I'm busy,"
but that wasn't good enough for you!

I hope it's one
of those home invasion deals...

and they shoot me in the head.

Well, if it's a home
invader, don't tell them I'm on the toilet!

There's no one there.

You're hearing things,
you crazy old lady.

Hey, Stuart. Have you seen Sheldon?

Yeah.
He's, uh, over in the graphic novel section.

Built himself a little nest.

Thank you.

 Uh, Penny.
 Yeah?

 Is everything okay?
 What do you mean?

Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard
are having a fight.

Oh, yeah, kind of. It's no big thing.

Oh, good. Good.

I love you.

I'm not leaving until you talk to me.

 Hey, what's going on?
 It's a little hard to explain.

He pretends
he's in an alternate dimension...

that occupies the same physical space
we're in, but he can't perceive us.

Don't flatter yourself.
I'm just ignoring you.

All right, come on, Sheldon,
let's go home. We're done fighting.

I've heard that before.

Then the next thing you know,
I'm hiding in my bedroom...

blaring a Richard Feynman lecture,
Mom shouting Jesus would forgive her...

if she put ground glass
in my dad's meat loaf.

And my dad's on the roof skeet shooting
her Franklin Mint collectible plates.

Okay, there's gonna be no more shouting
and no skeet shooting.

Really? Where's your friend Justin
going to sleep?

 Yeah, where is he gonna sleep?
 Oh, my God, would you let this go?

I'd let it go.

Why should I let it go? Why don't you
just tell the guy to find a place to sleep?

Oh, for God sakes.

So you have childhood issues.

We all have childhood issues.

At some point, you just need to grow up
and get past them.

Fire. Fire.

Leonard, let me handle this. Please?

 Fire, fire.
 Look, let... She...

Sheldon, please try and understand.

Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship
and occasionally we're gonna fight.

But no matter what happens
between us, we will always love you.

Right, Leonard?

Always is a long time.

Sure. Always.

You know, how about we buy you
this robot and then we all go home?

I want that one.

Okay, you can have that one.

Oh, come on.
He's just gonna play with it twice...

and then it'll end up in his closet
with all the other junk.

Buy him the robot, Leonard.

 Can I get this comic book too?
 Yes, you can.

We meet again.

So, what did Justin say when you told him
he couldn't sleep on your couch?

He's a musician.
He'll sleep in his own vomit if he has to.

I should have asked for much more
than a comic book and a robot.



Here's what I wonder
about zombies.

What happens if they can't get
any human flesh to eat?

They can't starve to death--
they're already dead.

You take this one.
I spent an hour last night on

"How do vampires shave

when they can't see
themselves in the mirror"?

Well-groomed vampires
meet in pairs

and shave each other--
case closed.

Yeah, okay, so, zombies.

I guess it depends
on the zombies, Raj.

Are we talking slow zombies,
fast zombies?

Like, in 28 Days,
if those zombies didn't eat,

they starved.
You're thinking

of 28 Days Later.

28 Days is where
Sandra Bullock goes to rehab

and puts the audience
into an undead state

Hey, don't bag
on Sandra Bullock!

You think it makes you
look cultured,

but you just
come off as bitter.

Oh, Dr. Siebert,
twelve o'clock.

Why's the president
of the university

slumming in the cafeteria?

Perhaps he's emulating
Shakespeare's Henry V,

who dressed as a commoner
and mingled among them,

to find out how he was being
perceived by his subjects.

Of course, if he'd

have read any
of the 1,300 e-mails

I've sent him on the subject
of his administration,

he could have saved himself
the trouble.

Or maybe he heard it's
Tator Tot Tuesday.

That's why I'm here.

Hey, there's
my favorite geniuses!

How are we doing today?

That depends--
how much longer

do you plan on
fondling my shoulder?

Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot
you have a touch phobia.

It's not a touch phobia,
it's a germ phobia.

If you'd like to go put on
a pair of latex gloves,

I'll let you check me
for a hernia.

Yeah.

So, listen, fellas, who's up
for a little party this Saturday night?

Open bar, good eats, might
even be a few pretty girls.

Sounds great!
I'm in!

Hold on.

Just because the nice man
is offering you candy,

doesn't mean you should jump
into his windowless van.

What's the occasion?

Just a little fund-raiser
for the university.

Aha! The tear-stained air
mattress in the back of the van.

I understand
your reticence, Dr. Cooper,

and I sympathize,
but the hard facts are,

occasionally,
we have to shake a few hands

and kiss a few butts
to raise money for our research.

I don't care;
it's demeaning.

And I refuse to be
trotted out and shown off

like a prize hog
at the Texas State Fair.

Which, by the way, is something
you don't want to attend

wearing a Star Trek
ensign's uniform.

All right,

let me put it this way.

You're gonna put on a suit,
you're gonna come to this party,

and you're gonna
explain your research

to a bunch of old people,

or I swear to God,
I'll blind you with a hot spoon,

like they did  to that little boy
in Slumdog Millionaire.

Oh, you don't want that.

So, Saturday night!

It's gonna be
off the hook.
Ugh!

Get over it.

Oh, boy!

Tator tots and
a party invitation?

What a great day!

 


There you go.

Are you sure
this is right?

Yeah, just tuck that
part in your pants;  you'll be fine.

Okay, let's go smooch some
rich, wrinkled tochis.

Oh, Howard, I can't believe
Bernadette let you go

to a fancy party
wearing a dickey.

Excuse me, my girlfriend
doesn't pick out my clothes.

My mother does.

Oh. We should
get going.

What about Sheldon?

Sheldon is not going.

Really? What do we tell Siebert?

Tell him Dr. Cooper feels
that the best use of his time

is to employ his rare
and precious mental faculties

to tear the mask off nature
and stare at the face of God.

Sheldon, it's Saturday night,
you'll be doing laundry.

Don't tell him that,
tell him the mask thing.

Hey, put your tie
back in your pants.

Nice place.

Reminds me of my parents'
house back in New Delhi.

 You're kidding.
 No. We are very wealthy.

But the only difference is,
we have more servants.

 More than this?
 More than we can use.

You see, in India,
we don't make the mistake

of letting our poor people
have dreams.

Ah. There's my band
of brainiacs.

Where's Dr. Cooper?

He's tearing the mask off nature
to look at the face of God.

The board of directors insists
he has a beautiful mind.

I think he's just bananas.

Come on, let me introduce you

to one of the university's
leading donors.

I think we were misled
about the cute girls.

Mrs. Latham, I'd like
you to meet three

of our outstanding
young researchers.

This is Dr. Leonard
Hofstadter,

Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
and Howard Wolowitz.

Well, what happened
to you, Wolowitz,

couldn't stick with it
long enough to get your PhD?

I'm an engineer.

Most engineers
don't bother with a PhD.

But you may be
interested to know

I designed the zero-gravity
waste-disposal system for NASA.

Got it--
you're a space plumber.

I'm gonna go hit the bar.

Tell me about
these two.

 Do him first.
 Dr. Hofstadter

is representing our
experimental physics
program tonight.

I think you'll
really enjoy

hearing about his
fascinating work.

Right.

Fascinate me.

They're cute when they're about
to wet themselves, aren't they?

I'll make it
easy for you.

When you arrive at the lab
in the morning,

what sort of machine
do you turn on?

Coffee maker?

All right, Dr. Kooth--
uh, whatever it is-- you're up.

It's Koothrappal

I have to tinkle.

And so, instead
of bowing to pressure,

and going to that
pointless soiree,

I stayed right here
and did a load of whites.

Well, normally I respect
your macho rebellious attitude

toward "The Man,"

but, in this case, I think
you've made a foolish mistake.

Unlikely.

But make your case.

Keeping in mind that
your critical attitude

is ruining our
Saturday night together,

and I'm not above
minimizing your window.

Sheldon, like it or not,

until you manage
to upload your intelligence

into a self-sustaining
orbiting satellite,

equipped with high-speed
Internet and a cloaking device,

you will be dependent on other
members of the human race.

That's it.
Prepare to be minimized.

I'm not finished.

All scientists have
to fund-raise, Sheldon.

How do you think
I paid for my lab?

I went to Saudi Arabia
and met with a prince

who had an interest
in neurobiology.

Your lab is funded by some
Middle-Eastern dilettante?

Technically,
Faisal is my fiancé.

But I do have a state-of-the-art
two-photon microscope

and a place to stay in Riyadh
for the winter.

Well, that explains those
puzzling camel race photos

on your Facebook page.

And consider this:

without you to make the case
for the physics department,

the task will fall to people
like Leonard and Rajesh.

Are you trying to scare me?

'Cause you're succeeding.

Well, then prepare
to be terrified.

If your friends
are unconvincing,

this year's donations
might go to,

say, the geology department.

Oh, dear, the dirt people!

Or worse-- it could go to...

the liberal arts.

No!

Millions of dollars
being showered on poets,

literary theorists
and students of gender studies.

Oh, the humanities!

On the bright side, I don't
think President Siebert

will be making us go
to any more fund-raisers.

It was so much easier
at my bar mitzvah.

The old people just came up
to you, pinched your cheek

and handed you a savings bond.

Oh, don't be such gloomy Gusses.

Look at the size
of these shrimp!

At what point do we start
calling them lobsters?

Face it, Raj,
we crashed and burned tonight.

Oh, you didn't
do that badly.

Mrs. Latham, the first machine
I turn on in the morning

is the helium-neon laser,
'cause it needs to warm up.

I no longer care, dear.

But don't worry,

I really enjoyed
meeting you this evening.

u're kidding.
That was good for you?

'Cause I was sweating
through my T-shirt.

Excellent! There's
nothing I like better

than making smart people
feel ill at ease.

Why?

Oh, I don't know,
it's one of the fun things

you get to do when
you have lots of money.

Watch.

Hey! Who said you
could eat that shrimp?

See? Fun.

No, no, no, I'm just here

for your money.

I don't want to shake
anyone's germy hands.

Explain it to
them, Siebert.

I must confess

I don't understand you,
President Siebert.

First you say you want me
to appear at your fund-raisers,

but now you say
you never want me to go

anywhere near your fund-raisers.

Forgive me, but that sounds
like a mixed message.

Here we go again.

If there's simply
no talking to me,

why did you call?

I'm sorry, someone's
on the other line.

Why don't you see if you
can organize your thoughts,

and we'll try again later.

Cooper-Hofstadter residence.
Go for Cooper.

Good morning, Mrs. Latham.

Well, yes, of course
I remember you.

A woman well past her prime

seeking to augment
her social status

by doling out her late husband's
ill-gotten gains.

So, how much money
are you going to give me?

I'm not crazy--
my mother had me tested.

Well, if you're not

going to give me money,
then why are you calling?

She wants to talk to you.

Who's crazy now?

Hello, Mrs. Latham.

Yes, I live with him.

I don't...
I-I really don't know why.

Tonight? Sure,
that'd be great.

Okay, I'll see you then.

Bye.

She wants to have dinner
and talk about my research.

An entire dinner
to talk about your research?

Where you going, the drive-thru
at Jack in the Box?

Well, wherever
we're going,

she's sending a car
to pick me up.

Okay,

 I see what's happening.
 What?

My stature intimidates her,

so she's using you to get to me.

Crafty old gal.

Excuse me, but you are not the
only distinguished scientist

in this apartment.

I've been published in
peer-reviewed journals,

I received a Dissertation
of the Year award

for experimental
particle physics.

No, that can't be it.

And since you seem

to have forgotten,
the reason we live together

is we're best friends.

And I got your back, Jack.

That was a great meal.
I'm glad you
enjoyed it.

The only time I eat this well
is when my mom's in town

 and she takes me out to dinner.
 Is that so?

You kind of
remind me of her.

She enjoys making people
uncomfortable, too.

Well, you remind me of
a boy I dated in college.

 No kidding.
 Sweet boy.

Very smart.

If only he'd had money.

Yeah, um...

so, hey,
speaking of money,

how are you feeling about
helping the physics department

get a cryogenic centrifugal
pump and molecular sieve?

Well, I must say, you make a
very persuasive case for it.

Oh, good, good.
And I'm seriously

considering taking it
to the next level.

Terrific. Great.

What level is that?

Okay, now you don't
remind me of my mom.

I'm sorry, so, eventually,
zombies are going to attack

the rehab facility
where Sandra Bullock is?

Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.

You know, it's a shame, all that
work she's doing to get sober,

only to be torn apart
and eaten alive.

Hey. How was dinner?

Swell. I need a drink.

Do we have any alcohol?

No. But we have potatoes--
I could make you vodka.

It'll take two weeks.

Leonard, are you okay?

Um, I'm not sure.

What's going on?

Well, Mrs. Latham said
she was seriously considering

donating money so we could get
a cryogenic centrifugal pump...

Yes!
Oh, wow!

then she stuck
her tongue down my throat.

Why?

Okay, we can't keep
explaining everything.

Read that book
we got you.

She hit on me.

Wait-wait-wait.
Are you telling us

that old lady wanted
to have sex with you

in exchange for giving your
department millions of dollars?

I think so.

You lucky duck.

You're really
a broken toy, aren't you?

I was able to get out of there
before anything else happened,

but she wants to see me again
tomorrow night.

Excellent!
What are you planning to wear?

What?

Penny, you're an expert on trading
sexual favors for material gain--

walk him through this.

Well, n-no, hold on a second,
I'm not going to sleep with her.

But we need a cryogenic
centrifugal pump.

Well, forget it!
It's not gonna happen.

Well, come now, Leonard,
this may be your only chance

to make a real contribution
to science!

I repeat: Not gonna happen.

What was all that
about me trading sexual favors

for material gain?

It was a compliment.

I believe in giving credit
where credit is due.

Okay, fine. I'll tell him.

Leonard, Mrs. Latham's car
is here for you.

I won't be too late;
I'm just gonna make

a final pitch for the funding
and then say good night.

Hold on,
I have something for you.

What's this?

Just a few things you
may need tonight.

Baby oil, condoms
and, uh...

a little something I procured from the
school of pharmacology.

They say it is to Viagra as
Viagra is to a green M&M.

I am not going
to have sex with her.

Maybe this will overcome
your reluctance.

I went on the Internet
and found a photograph

of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham
to get your libido humming.

Check out those saddle shoes.

Are you insane?

I'm not going
to prostitute myself

just so we can get
some new equipment.

Oh, come on! Why not?

Good night,

Sheldon.
Given how much time

you spend engaging
in pointless self-abuse,

you might consider,
just this once,

using your genitalia to
actually accomplish something!

He still won't shag
the old lady, huh?

No. But thank you for asking.

Hey. Hi.

Hello, Leonard.

I hope you're hungry.

I'm very hungry.

For food, right?

Oh, I made you uncomfortable
last night.

I'm so sorry.

No, that's okay.

No, it most
certainly is not.

Leonard, I'm making the
donation to your department

regardless of what
happens between us.

 Really?
 Well, of course.

There's no quid
pro quo here.

You and your colleagues are
doing remarkable research,

and you deserve the money.

Oh.

Then what was
last night about?

I took a shot; sue me.

Oh.

You're a very
handsome man, Leonard.

Thank you.

It was foolish of me to
think someone your age

might ever be interested
in someone like me.

Oh, don't say that.

 You're a very attractive woman.
 Oh, please.

 No, it's true.
 Well, aren't you sweet.

Just for the record...

you'd remember a night with me
for the rest of your life.

I'm sure I would.

But why-why, exactly?

You're a very smart man.

How do you think I landed
such a rich husband?

I hadn't really
given it much thought.

Well, think about it.

Do you mean...?

Yep. I'm that good.

Oh, what the hell.

Good morning, slut.

What?

Oh, please, I recognize
the walk of shame
when I see it.

All you're missing is
a little smeared mascara

and a purse with panties
wadded up in it.

What's
going on?

Oh, nothing's going on.

Excuse me.

 Are you just getting home?
 Yeah.

That's a good sign, right?

Oh, yeah.

I'm so proud of you!

You sold yourself out

like a common streetwalker!

No, I didn't do it
for the money.

She stiffed you?

I believe that's what
your roommate did to her.

What?!

Again, read the
book we gave you.

No, I mean,

I-I got the money first.

Smart. Get paid up front.

Yeah, I think you have a real
knack for gigolo work, Leonard.

Uh...

I'm gonna go lie down.

That's a good idea;
get your rest.

There are a lot more
rich old ladies out there,

and Daddy needs
a new linear accelerator.

And I thought he didn't learn anything
from his relationship with you.

Hey!

Another compliment!

Learn to recognize them.

Ah, there he is!

The man of the hour!

He took one for the team!

I didn't do it
for the money!

Keep telling yourself that--
it makes it easier.

Trust me, I know.

Cool, buddy!
That's awesome!
Yeah!

How was she?



Wanna spend time playing the new
"Star Wars" game this weekend?

Mm, I don't know,
I promised myself I'd get off the computer...

be more physically active,
get some exercise.

You're about to walk up
three flights of stairs.

Well, good point. I'm in.

You know what would be great?
Let's do it like the old days.

 Mm, you talking gaming marathon?
 Yeah.

Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours,
sleeping bags, junk food.

so our moms can't call.

It'll be like our "World of Warcraft" party
when the neighbors called the cops on us.


They called the cops because of the smell.
They thought we were dead.

We were bad-ass back in the day.

 All right, let's do it.
 Forty-eight hours of "Star wars" gaming.

It's on like Alderaan.


Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend.

Starting Saturday morning,
"Star Wars" marathon.

 Woo-hoo.
 Movies or video games?

Or board games? Or trading-card games?

Or Legos? Or dress-up? Or comic books?

Or dramatic readings of novelizations?

Yes to all.

We are going to play the online game.

The online game? Bully.

As much as I'm sure Sheldon would enjoy...

playing intergalactic make-believe,
he and I have plans.

We are attending my Aunt Flora's
93rd birthday party.

Just tell her I can't come.

She'll be disappointed if we don't show.

She's 93.
She won't be disappointed for very long.

Hang on. I followed all the protocols...

set forth by you
in the Relationship Agreement.

I made a written request
72 hours in advance.

Checked the tire pressure on the car.

I contacted the
Centers for Disease Control...

to find out what shots they
recommend for travel to Orange County.

FYI, it's none.

Amy, the Relationship Agreement...

was not designed
for either one of us to get our way.

You use it to get your way.

I use it to get the right way.

The fact that the right way
is also my way is a happy coincidence.

You gave me your word.
You're coming with me.

We'll miss you, Sheldon.

Yeah? Well, who wants
to spend the whole weekend...

running around a bunch of pretend
planets battling made-up monsters?

 That's for babies.
 Yeah, but it's got lightsabers.

Yeah. Please, Amy, it's got lightsabers.

 Hello, Stuart.
 Hey, Sheldon.

 Help you with anything?
 Yes.

I'm attending a party this weekend
for a 93-year-old woman.

Can you recommend a gift?

Uh, I don't know.

Could put a tennis ball on the end
of Excalibur...

make a pretty bad-ass cane.

Do you supply the ball?

 No.
 Then no.

 What else?
 Uh, oh.

Got this collector's edition
Batman Utility Belt.

Maybe she could use it
as a wearable pill caddy.

Well, she'd just look silly wearing that
without the rest of the costume.

Um, sorry, Sheldon, that's it.
That's all I got.

It's not your fault.
I've been to the model-train store.

I've been to Radio Shack.
This woman's impossible to shop for.

I'd make fun of Sheldon
for having girl problems...

if I wasn't in shock
that Sheldon has girl problems.

Well, Leonard, go ahead and mock.

It's like my daddy always said:

"Shelly, women aren't anything
but flipping pains in the bottom."

That's what your father used to say?

Well, I took out the bad words
and the "yeehaw," but you get the gist.

If you don't wanna go to the party,
just don't go. You're a grown man.

Act like one. Tell Amy you wanna spend
the weekend having a sleepover...

and playing video games
with your friends.

Yeah, maybe she'll dig it.
Women like a firm hand on the tiller.

I can never find the tiller.

I got a book. It didn't help.

Yeah, I always thought
if I were ever enslaved...

it would be by an advanced species
from another planet...

not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.

I downloaded an app
that might be helpful in this situation.



You're right. I'm smart as a whip.
I should be able to figure this out.

Listen, I kind of made plans
with the guys this weekend.

I wondered, because
we're in this relationship beta test...

if I should have asked you first.

Then I thought if
I did check with you first...

you'd think that
I was taking things too seriously...

and then I got a nosebleed.

You don't have to check with me.
Do whatever you want.

Oh.

Guess I was hoping
for a different reaction, but okay.

 Really? What were you hoping for?
 I don't know.

Maybe that you'd be a little upset.

And then you'd realize that
I'm a stallion that has to run free.

And that would turn you on a little.

Okay, I'm an actress. Ask me again.


Do you mind if I spend the weekend
playing games with the guys?

Wha...? The entire weekend?
You mean I wouldn't see you at all?

But I do... No, no,
I knew what I was getting into.

You can't put a saddle
on Leonard Hofstadter.

Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, Papi.

"Ay, Papi"?

 What is that?
 An acting choice.

Hmm.

So you chose that
when you become turned on...

you'd turn into Speedy Gonzalez.

Do you got a problem with that, Papi?

Uh-uh.


Penny? Penny? Penny?

Sorry, Stallion.
Your weird friend Giraffe is here.

Hello, Penny. I just stopped by
to bring you this gift.

Gummi Bears? Thank you.

Now that you're in my debt...


please manipulate Amy into
releasing me from my commitment...

to attend her aunt's tedious
birthday party.

 Not a chance.
 All right.

I thought the candy might not
be enough, so let me up the ante.

Ahem. These are Cooper Coupons.

These are for various things
I can do for you.

Um, oh, this one is for
one free grammar check.

Uh...

You could use it for e-mails,
letters, tattoos, what have you.

Uh...

Oh, this is a fun one.
This is an afternoon with me...

at the California Science Center
where I point out their mistakes.

Keep an eye on those expiration dates.
I've been burned more than once.

I'm not gonna get involved
in your relationship.

Come on. It's just a simple favor.
When's the last time...

 ...I asked you to do something for me?
 Yesterday.

You made me look in your ear
to see if there was a ladybug in it.

Last time I asked you to do something
that wasn't a medical emergency?

Yesterday. You made me look in your ear
to see if there was a ladybug in it.

All right, I have no choice...

 ...but to go on to plan B.
 What's that?

Run around outside with a wet head
and try to catch a cold.

 Good morning.
 Hello.

I think you'll really enjoy yourself today.
You get to meet my relatives.

Since my aunt's nursing home
is catering the party...

all the food is incredibly soft.
It's like a vacation for your teeth.

All right.

 You sure you're okay with this?
 Yes.

I decided to find a way that
I could have this experience and enjoy it.

Thank you. That means a lot to me.

Oh, don't thank me.
Thank wireless technology.

Yeah, I realized I can go
to your aunt's awful party...

and still spend the whole day
gaming with my friends.

My relatives are gonna wanna talk to you.

And you're gonna be sitting there
playing a game?

 Isn't that a little rude?
 Oh, I got that covered.

Headset. I won't hear a word
the old geezers are saying.

If playing that game is more important
than honoring your commitment to me...

and you don't mind me showing up
all by myself...

after I've told everybody
I'll be bringing somebody...

then fine, go home and play your game.


Thanks. Oh, listen.

I wouldn't mind a piece of birthday cake...

provided the old gal's candle blow
is clean and dry.

Here you go. I've got everything
we'll need for the big game.

Low-fat turkey jerky.

Low-carb beer.

Hundred-calorie snack packs.

Pick up a Y chromosome while
you were there? You might be short one.

Hey, I plan on leveling up in the game,
not my swimsuit size...

thank you very much.

Gentlemen,
the game offers us a choice...

between playing for the Republic
and the light side...

or the Sith Empire and the dark side.

We're always the good guys.
In "D&D" we're lawful good.

In "City of Heroes" we're heroes.
In "Grand Theft Auto"...

we pay the prostitutes promptly
and never hit them with a bat.

Those women are prostitutes?

You said they were raising money
for stem-cell research.

Hey, guys. I got a surprise.

Mm, if it's yogurt that helps ladies poop,
I think Raj beat you to it.

No, Bernadette's gonna be playing with us.

So that's pretty cool, huh?
Right? Sure, it is.

Wha...? You invited your girlfriend?

 This is supposed to be our weekend.
 I had no choice.

She said, "Why don't we go out
for brunch and maybe the arboretum?"

I said, "No, I promised the guys I was
gonna play a video game with them."

She said, "Can I come?"
Then I didn't answer for a second.

Then she said,
"Do you not want me to come?"

Then I bought her a new laptop
and the game...

and she's parking the car now.

Is the whip-sound app
contextually appropriate here?

Uh, it is, but I think you might have
waited too long for it to be funny.



 I was wrong. It's still funny.
 Oh, good.


Oh.

 Amy, what's wrong?
 My boyfriend's a jerk.

Well, I know he didn't cheat on you,
so, what happened?

I had to go to my aunt's party by myself.

Everybody was like, "where's this
boyfriend you talk about? Is he real?

Or did you make him up like Armin
the miniature-horse breeder?"

Who's Armin the miniature-horse breeder?

The pretend boyfriend I invented
to get my family off my back.

It unraveled quickly when I couldn't answer
the question "How did you two meet?"

 I would've thought at a horse show.
 Oh, that's good.

Mm.

I panicked and said Woodstock.


I just wanted to show Sheldon off
to my family.

Sure, I get that. I mean,
he's your first boyfriend and all.

Not just my first boyfriend. He's the best
boyfriend. I mean, think about it.

I'm dating Sheldon Cooper.

Yes, on purpose.

He's handsome, he's lanky, he's brilliant.

His skin has that pale, waxy quality.

Well, sickly is the new sexy.

 Yeah.
 Mm.

You know, Amy...

when you're in a relationship
with someone you really care about...

the sucky part is
it leaves you open to getting hurt.

Do you ever worry about Leonard
doing that to you?

Ha, ha, that's hilarious. No.

Get that guy! Get that guy!

Pew, pew, pew!

Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski,
it may interest you to know...

that saying, "Pew, pew, pew," isn't
as effective as pressing your blaster key.

In the same way that saying, "Whee,"
doesn't make the landspeeder go.

Pew!

 Raj, imperial Troopers on your tail.

When Gandhi advocated
his philosophy of nonviolence...

I bet he didn't know how much fun
it was killing stuff.

All right, I think we got them all.
Let's divide up the loot.

this pretty purple robe I just got.

You should put on yours
and then we'll match.

But I worked hard to get this armor, heh.

Sorry, I just thought it'd be nice
if people knew we were a couple.

Fine, I'll change.



I don't think I wanna play a game.

They're playing one across the hall.
We should too.

Okay, we are gonna take turns
bouncing a quarter off the table.

If it goes into this cup,
the other person has to drink.

Then you get to go again, and you ki...

 Like that?
 Wow, yeah, beginner's luck.

So now I will drink this entire cup of beer...

and you will go again and we can...

All right, so, yeah.
Okay, now I'm gonna drink this entire cup.

And then I'm going to drink another one.

Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?

I spent my childhood throwing coins
into wishing wells hoping for friends.

At a certain point, you start doing
trick shots to keep things interesting.

Oh, give me a second
to catch up here, hold on.


That'd be my boyfriend...

happier playing his Star Trek game
with friends than hanging out with me.

 Wars.
 What?

Star Wars. They get all cranky
when you mix the two up.

 What's the difference?
 There's absolutely no difference.

How do I get him to treat me better?

All right, let me give you
a little Girlfriend 101.

Usually the first move is you withhold sex...

but that will work better
after Sheldon hits puberty.

So I'd say give him the silent treatment.

 No, he loves that.
 Hmm.

Our record for sitting in a room together
and not speaking...

is six and a half hours.
He said it was a magical evening.

All right, we're gonna have
to go with an oldie but goodie:

 Making a scene.
 I don't think I'd be good at that.

Ah. You're lucky to have me.
Back in Omaha...

there are two restaurants
I'm not allowed into. Both Chili's.

Bernadette, your character
is the healer in our group.

In charge of healing all of us,
not just Howard.

Can't help it.
My Howie-wowie has an owie. Ha, ha.

That is the most sickeningly sweet thing
I have ever experienced.

And I am sipping Kool-Aid
through a Red Vine.

Sheldon, I've got a bone to pick with you,
and I'll do it in front of all your friends.

Yeah, you pick that bone.
You pick that bone clean.

I'm gonna publicly shame you
and then sit back...

as societal pressure compels you
to modify your behavior.

Oh, burn!

If you don't start treating me better,
I'm leaving you...

for a miniature-horse breeder
named Armin.

 Armin who?
 Armin... Damn it.

Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to
her family and you stood her up, okay?

I mean, look at this adorable,
smushy face.

Smush, smush, smush.

 You're hurting me.
 No, Sheldon hurt you.

 Before. Now it's you.
 Oh.

I think I understand.

You're the one person who can say
Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend.

But that rings hollow if you can't
lord him over others in the flesh.

I forget what I bring to the party
and what I take away when I leave.

Please accept these valuable
Cooper Coupons...

 ...as restitution.
 She doesn't want your stupid coupons...

The Science Center? Redeeming. Let's go.

Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler.
Let me get my coat.


Oh, grow up, Leonard.

Excuse me, I have something to say.

None of you may realize it, but I was very
much looking forward to this weekend.

It was gonna be like the old days.
The four of us hanging out...

playing video games,
before you guys all got girlfriends.

Do you have any idea what it's like
to be the only one without a girlfriend?

Even if I get one someday...

I'll still be the guy who got a girl
after Sheldon Cooper!

And that's how a girl makes a scene.

I'm sorry. You're right.
You deserve your weekend.

 Come on, Amy, let's go.
 What about the Science Center?

Oh, I'll let you hold my hair
while I throw up.

Rain check.

 I'm gonna go too.
 I'll miss you.

 I'll miss you.
 But I'll miss you more.

 No, I'll miss you...
 Just leave.

Ahh. Okay, now,
this is the way it's supposed to be.

Men together, fighting the forces of evil.

 Hear, hear.

Ah.

Can't believe this is only 64 calories.


I've been worried sick for two days...

and I know you turned off your phone!

You open up this door right now,
because I've had it up to here!

I have been to the morgue
and the hospital...

and I've spent the last half-hour
walking up these farkakte stairs!

That's my ride. Gotta go, heh.




I'm gonna run to the store.
I'll pick you up when you're done.

Okay. I like it a little better
when you stay, but all right.

 Hey, Sheldon.
 Hello.

I'm here for my haircut
with Mr. D'Onofrio.

I'm sorry, Uncle Tony is in the hospital.
He's pretty sick.

Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's
in the hospital.

Why do these things
always happen to me?

 I can cut it for you.
 You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.

I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio.

You believe this guy?

Excuse us for a second.

Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it.
He's a barber.

He's not a barber, he's the nephew.

An example of the nepotism...

that runs rampant
in the barbering industry.

Besides Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly
how I like my hair done...

because he has all my haircut records
from my barber in Texas.

What are you talking about?

When I first moved here, I was nervous
about finding a new barber...

so my mother had all my haircut
records sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.

There's no such thing
as haircut records.

 Yes, there are.
 Have you ever seen them?

No, but my mother assured me
they were sent here...

and I'll bet you dollars to donuts
that this one doesn't have them.

Excuse me.

Do you have access
to my haircut records?

Your what?

To paraphrase T.S. Eliot,
this is the way the world ends.

Not with a bang but with a nephew.

Sheldon, you're a grown man,
he's a professional...

and your haircut is number three
on that poster from 1946.

 Just sit down and let him do it.
 Fine.

But if I come out of this
looking like a dork, it's on you.

 So my kid said the funniest thing today.
 Nope.

When you tell this story later,
the word we usually use is "quirky."

 Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
 Sure.


 What are you doing?
 I'm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.

Sheldon, you are one day late
for your haircut.

Thank you
for captioning my nightmare.

 Lookie here, I got my travel orders.
 Hmm.

"Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz
is requested to report...

to the NASA Johnson Space Center,
Houston, Texas...

for astronaut training
Monday 8 a.m."

Yeah, but it's from NASA,
so it's 0800.

But it says 8 a.m.

 You read it as 0800.
 Lt doesn't have an O in front of it.

It does have an O in front of it.

Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut,
and you're dying of jealousy.

So, what kind of things are they...?
Will you stop that?

I can't help it,
I feel like a teen heartthrob.

Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair.
I could do it.

Penny, I know you mean well,
offering the skills of the hill folk...

but here in town,
we don't churn our own butter...

we don't make dresses
out of gunny sacks...

and we sure as shooting
don't get our hair cut by bottle-blond...

Sheldon, be nice.

I'm sorry, it's the bad-boy attitude
that comes with this hair.

You could go to my guy.
He's at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills.

They bring you a cup of tea,
massage your scalp.

It's $200 but sometimes
you look in the next chair...

and you see a superstar
like Tony Danza.

Quick question here, have we actually
changed the conversation...

from "I'm going to astronaut training"
to "Sheldon can't get a haircut"?

Now who's dying of jealousy?
"Oh," it's you.

I'm a cowboy

On a steel horse
I ride

I'm wanted

Wanted
Dead or alive

Sheldon, you're ruining
girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.

I'm sorry. I'm looking for a barber
and I'm running out of time.

My hair is growing...

at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers
per femtosecond.

If you're quiet, you can hear it.

 What about Supercuts?
 No, I tried once.

They do men's and women's hair
in the same room at the same time.

It's like Sodom and Gomorrah
with mousse.

Well, this isn't a crisis. Why don't
you just let your hair grow out a little?

Why don't I let my hair grow out?

Why don't I start wearing
Birkenstocks...

and seeking validation of my opinions
by asking, "Can you dig it?"

I don't know. I think
you might look sexy with long hair.

With the kind
that flows down to your shoulders...

and blows back
while riding on a horse.

Bareback and bare-chested.

I'm gonna go brush my teeth,
it might take a while.

 Hi.
 Hi, sweetie.

 I miss you.
 I miss you too.

So tell me all about your first day.

Oh, wow, where do I even start?
I got to experience zero gravity.

 Cool. How do they do that?
 Lt's pretty neat.

You get in this plane that goes
almost straight up for like 20 seconds...

and then straight back down
like it's gonna crash...

and they do it over and over again,
no matter how many times you throw up.

 You threw up?
 Yeah. And the craziest part is...

because there's no gravity,
the throw-up kind of floats there.

In a little ball,
and if your mouth is open...

because you're screaming...

sometimes it just floats right back in.

Boy, does everyone laugh at you
when that happens.

 That sounds mean.
 No.

I would have laughed too...

but I didn't want
the vomit to come back out.


Heh. Anyway...

Oh, could you do me a favor...

and overnight me
some more underwear?

 Sure, why?
 I got a look at the centrifuge...

they're gonna
spin me around in tomorrow...

and I have a hunch
I packed a little light.

Mr. D'Onofrio?

It's me, Sheldon.

They didn't have anything
barber-themed in the gift shop...

so I got you this.

Don't know if you can read his little
T-shirt. It says, "Get well beary soon."

Trust me, if you were even a little
conscious right now, you'd be laughing.


Anyway...

There's new studies that show...

people in comas are aware
of everything going on around them.

With that in mind, if you can hear me...

move away from the light
and toward the sound of these scissors.

 Can I help you?
 Yes.

Do you have something
I could use as a cape?

Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills,
slip out of the ninth floor...

and go on a little adventure?

Oh, no, I'm just here
to get my hair cut.


I see. Just wait here one moment.

Security!

I gotta run. But not with scissors.
That would be unsafe.

So if I move my horsey here...

isn't that checkmate and I win?

Hmm.

Oh... Is it or isn't it?

You know, I think
this is a good stopping point.

It's your first real game.
I threw a lot of information at you.

No, your king is trapped.

He can't go here
because of my lighthouse...

and...

he can't go here
because of my pointy-head guy.

Like I said, complicated game.

 So did I win or not?
 Did you have fun?

Because if you had fun,
then you are a winner.

That's what chess is all about.

 Hello.
 Hey.

Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.

Why? My spot, your spot.
What difference does it make?

 Okay, what just happened?
 I don't know.

Between you playing chess
like Bobby Fischer...

and Sheldon being okay
with you in his spot...

I'm guessing
someone went back in time...

stepped on a bug,
and changed the course of human events.

 Sweetie, are you all right?
 No, I'm not all right.

It's been six days
since I was supposed to get a haircut...

and nothing horrible has happened.

Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand.

 Leonard, explain it to her.
 Oh, uh, he's crazy.

I have spent my whole life
trying to bring order to the universe...

by carefully planning
every moment of every day.

But all my efforts, our dinner schedule,
my pajama rotation...

my bowel movement spreadsheet...

it's clear now,
I've been wasting my time.

Good. I'm taking that disgusting chart
off the fridge.

You know...

sometimes it's nice
not knowing what's coming.

Look at me and Leonard.

We went out, broke up,
trying again.

We don't know what's gonna happen.

Oh, please, everyone knows
what's going to happen.

But I see your point.

I think this could be good for you.

Maybe it's time for you
to shake things up a bit.

You're right.

I should embrace the chaos.

 Great. What are you gonna do first?
 I don't know.

I could do anything. All bets are off.

The world is my oyster.

I got it.

I'm gonna put on
my Tuesday pajamas tonight.

I got to tell you,
I'm a little worried about him.

If I were you, I'd be worried...

that a girl who's never played chess
in her life just kicked your ass.

Hi.

Howie, what happened to you?

We did overnight survival training
in the wilderness.

Big fun. Big, big fun.

I was gonna freshen up for you...

but I blacked out a little
on the way to the bathroom.

Survival training?
Is that like camping?

Uh-huh. Except you don't have food
or water...

and they don't have
a sunset Sabbath service...

like they do at Camp Hess Kramer.

 Do you sleep in tents?
 No.

I slept in a hole I dug in the ground
with my bare hands.

And at some point during the night,
an armadillo crawled in...

and spooned me.

 Poor baby.
 But I did it. I survived.

I wasn't sure
I was going to when the sandstorm hit.

I just pulled my turtleneck up
over my head and waited for death.

But somehow as I sat there...

wrapped in a cocoon
of my own neck-sweat...

I found that primal part
of the human spirit...

that just wants to keep on living,
heh-heh, no matter what the cost.

You're so brave. I'm proud of you.

I ate a butterfly.

It was so small...

beautiful...

but I was so hungry.

 Are you crying?
 No, I don't think it's possible.

I'm severely dehydrated.

My pee is like toothpaste.

Howie, if you're not able to do this,
come home.

It won't change how I feel about you.

Thanks, honey, but I can't quit.

If I do, I'd just be a guy...

who had a chance to be an astronaut
and gave it up.

Is there anything I could do to help?

No.

Wait. Send more underwear.


Don't let this be
Sheldon playing bongos.

Please, don't let this be
Sheldon playing bongos.

Do you like my bongos?

Bet you didn't know that I had bongos

Sheldon, it's 3:00 in the morning.

Three in the morning
Is a good time for bongos

I was sleeping.

Leonard sleeps while I play bongos

No, he doesn't.

Leonard no sleep while I play bongos

Bongo solo.

Stop. Stop it. Stop. Stop.

Stop it.

 What the hell?
 Oh, hi, Penny, guess what?

Sheldon got bongos.

 Why did you get bongos?
 Richard Feynman played the bongos.

I thought I'd try.

Feynman was a famous physicist.

It's 3:00 in the morning.

I don't care if Richard Feynman was a
purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.

If he were a purple leprechaun

Penny forgot to use the subjunctive

Sheldon, go to bed.
You have work in the morning.

Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow
I start a bongo band and tour the world.

No, hang on. Roommate Agreement.

No hootenannies, sing-a-longs,
or barbershop quartets after 10 p.m.

Roommate Agreement?
Are you kidding?

We are living in a world of chaos.

Roommate Agreement.

 Where are you going?
 Wherever the music takes me, kitten.

I play bongos walking down the stairs

Oh! Oh!

Never play bongos
Walking down the stairs


 Surprise.
 What are you doing here?

Here to help you get through this.

Can't do it on your own,
you need someone to take care of you.

 Oh. I love you so much.
 Oh, and I love you.

Howard, your bath is getting cold.

Don't worry, once she falls asleep,
I'll spoon you like an armadillo. Heh.

He showed up in the middle of the night
with his bongos.

I foolishly thought
it was some sort of musical booty call.

Poor guy.
He must have been exhausted.

While Leonard play the bongo

 That was kind of uncalled for.
 No, it was called for.

What's going on?

Sheldon, this craziness has gone
on long enough.

Please come home
so I can cut your hair.

Penny, you're not trained.
You're not licensed.

And most importantly, you don't have
access to my haircut records.

All right, honey, look...

we've known each other
for a long time now, right?

I've taken you to Disneyland,
I kicked a bully in the nuts for you.

I sing you "Soft Kitty" when you're sick,
you've even seen me naked once.

I'm sorry, what?

It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon,
I promise I know what I'm doing.

Please let me cut your hair.

Amy, what do you think?

There's not a hair on my body
I wouldn't let this woman trim.

Fine, let's go.

Thank you for letting me sleep
on your couch.

There's only so many times a woman
can say, "How about the bed?"

Sheldon seeing you naked?

It was just her bottom and her breasts.

Almost done.

At the end of the haircut,
Mr. D'Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.

Oh, sorry, I don't know any dirty jokes.

That's okay,
I never understood them anyway.



But I think I can pull it off.
Well done, Penny.

Told you. I'm just gonna
clean up your neck a little...

 ...and then you are good to go.
 Fun time.



Sorry,
sometimes the clippers tickle me.

Okay.


Okay, yep, we're all done now.
Lt's... it's good.

Let me just take that away from you.
Okay.

 Thank you very much.
 You are welcome.

Okay.

Yeah, I'm gonna have to move. Ahem.



 What are you doing?
 Oh, Priya's calling in a few minutes...

on Skype
and we are gonna have a dinner date.

It's 8:00 in the morning in Mumbai.

How can she have dinner?

Whatever.
Priya will be having breakfast.

All right.
So technically, it's not a dinner date.

I suppose you could call it
a, uh, dinfast date.

But if you did, you'd open yourself
to peer-based mocking...

such as, "Hey, Leonard, how was
your dinfast with Priya last night?"

That doesn't sound like mocking.

You didn't let me finish.

Dinfast.

Are those soy-based candles?

I don't know. Why?

Paraffin candles
may contain carcinogens.

Unless lung cancer is the ambiance
you were going for at your dinfast.

Dinfast.

I don't wanna be rude,
but Priya's gonna be calling, so...

Oh, yes. Priya.

Leonard, you know I make a point...

of never interfering
in your personal affairs.

Yes, I've always admired that
about you.

As well you should.

But I'm going to make
an exception here.

Oh, good.

Priya has moved back to India
to pursue her law career.

Instead of desperately trying to keep
this intercontinental relationship alive...

you could use that time
to take up a hobby.

 A hobby?
 Yes.

I read recently about a fellow in Kansas
with an enormous ball of twine.

I bet you could give him
a run for his money.

You know, some people might say...

that it's great that we're trying
to make things work.

They'd say things like, "Love is stronger
than the miles between you."

When I rise to power,
those people will be sterilized.

You video chat with Amy all the time.
How is this different?

Don't you like Amy?

 Of course, I like Amy.
 Well, there's the difference.


Excuse me, that's Priya.

 Hi, Leonard.
 Hey, honey.

 I miss you.
 Oh, I miss you too.

I miss the old days...

when your romantic partners
could be returned to the video store.

Thanks for letting me stay here while
Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.

Oh, it's no problem.

It's actually kind of nice.
You reading, me reading.

We're like an old married couple.

If we were an old married couple...

the wife would serve iced tea
and snickerdoodles.

I don't have iced tea
and snickerdoodles.

A good wife would go to the store.

I want a divorce.

Good. On the way to see the lawyer,
pick up some tea and cookies.


I must say,
I am enjoying your new chair.

 Oh, it's great, isn't it?
 It is.

Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx,
balances the buttocks.

 This is a chair worthy of the name.
 What name?

Chair.

Well, I'm glad you like it.

I mean, I still can't get over the fact
someone just threw it away.

 What?
 It was just sitting on the street.

I paid a homeless guy
to help me get it up here.

Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

 What is wrong?
 I've been sitting in garbage.

Sheldon, take it easy.

You take it easy.
I need to use your shower.

I went into this marriage
with so much hope.

There's a wet Band-Aid
on the shower floor.


Heh, this is fun. I've never used
a hydraulic thermoforming press before.

It's pretty sweet, huh?

This little baby set the university back
a hundred and seventy-five grand.

That's three minutes.

 Should we see what we got?
 Hang on.

Oh, yeah.
This is one good-looking panini.

 Hand me the tuna melt.
 Yup.

Thank you.

How's it going
with the long-distance love affair?

It's not easy,
but we're making it work.

When you say making it work...

does that include
doing the cyber-nasty?

 What?
 You know, the virtual pickle tickle, heh.

The digital:


Dude, this is my sister
you're talking about.

Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her
through a webcam...

has gotta be easier to deal with
than him touching her with it.

There's no junk-jiggling. We just talk.

Are you insane? With high-speed
Internet, you have at your fingertips...

the greatest advancement in the field
of sex since the invention of the washcloth.

I can't do that.

Heh, well, if you don't,
you're gonna lose Priya...

to some fancy guy in a turban...

who grew up
with Kama Sutra coloring books.

How can you be so racist?

Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.

Oh, Leonard, good, there you are.

I need you to check my head
for chair lice.

I did it last night,
I'm not doing it again.

Just his head, right?

I don't wanna talk about it.

You didn't catch bugs
from Penny's chair.

Yes, I did. And now they're cavorting
at the base of my hair follicles...

like dancing hippies
at the Redwood National Forest.

Sheldon, you do this all the time.

You fixate on some crazy idea
and then blow it way out of proportion.

Name one time I've ever done that.

How about when you put GPS trackers
in your garbage...

because you were convinced North
Korean spies were stealing your doodles.

The chicken nuggets
you were sure were human nuggets.

The strangely-shaped cloud
that was following you around town.

The time you put on my shirt...

and were convinced
you'd started growing again.

I said name one. You really need
to work on your listening skills.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

Hello.

You need to remove that chair
from the building. It's a health hazard.

I took off the slipcovers, had them
dry-cleaned and fumigated the cushions.

 Really?
 Yeah, it's cleaner than my couch.

Found half a Hot Pocket in there.

It certainly looks okay.

Has a strong toxic chemical smell.

 That's reassuring.
 Why don't you give it a try, Sheldon?

All right.

Oh.

It is a comfortable chair.

Why don't you just admit
you overreacted?

No, thank you.

It's like living with a Chihuahua.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

What's up, buttercup?

 You have to get rid of the chair. You...
 Nope.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

What's the word, hummingbird?

For your safety...

please wait in my apartment
as I call the authorities...

so they may remove
the chair of death.

No.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

What's the gist, physicist?

Under my authority
as a self-appointed member...

of the Centers for Disease Control
street team...

these premises are condemned.

As a man with a keen sense of style...

I must tell you,
that chair does not work with the room.

Penny. Penny.


Penny.

So here we are. Back in bed together.

Yep, here we are.


 Okay, so I guess I'll just jump right in.
 All right.

You're a naughty girl...

and I wanna punish you
with my love.

What?

 Not good?
 That's terrible. Try again.

Okay. Uh, uh, you're not naughty, uh...

You're dirty.

You're...

You're a dirty girl?

Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
You're a... You're a...

You're a dirty...

disgusting, revolting girl.


 God, Leonard. Stop talking.
 Why don't you give me five minutes?

I'll Google how to do this,
I'll call you right back.

Shh...

Just be quiet and do what I tell you.

Okay, like usual, good.

Take off your shirt.

Alrighty.

Shirt coming off.

Ta-da. Man nipples.


 I said be quiet.
 Yes, ma'am.

Now take off your shorts.

Taking shorts off.

There we go.

Naked, naked, naked.

Wonderful.
Now I'll take off my clothes.

Cool.

Uh-oh.

Here I am, baby.

You miss these?

 Damn it.
 Oh, Leonard. Already?

No, no, no.

The screen froze.
It's probably just buffering.

 Just give it a second?
 Fine.

So how are your mom and dad?

I really don't want to talk
about my parents.

Yeah. Sure, sure.

try resetting the TCP/IP stack.

Oh.

 I didn't even think of that. Thanks.

Let me know when you are done
hogging the bandwidth for self-abuse.

I'm trying to stream a movie
on Netflix in here.

Five, six, seven, eight.

Tall and tan and young and lovely

The girl from Ipanema goes walking

And when she passes
Each one she passes goes


Amy. Amy. Amy.

Oh.

Your ritualistic knocking behavior
is symptomatic...

 ...of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
 Is not.

Is not. Is not.

Denial. Denial. Denial. Come in.

Thank you.

Would you like to hear me play
a bossa nova standard?

No.

How about the theme song
to the television show Diff'rent Strokes?

Now the world don't move to the

No.

Well, that's every song I know.
What's up?

You're good friends with Penny, right?

Best friends, besties.
BFFs, peas-in-a-pod...

sisters who would share
traveling pants. Go on.

I was hoping she might listen to you...

about the dangers
of owning unhygienic furniture.

For general educational purposes...

or has she acquired a bar stool
dipped in cholera?

Cholera is water-borne.
You're mocking me.

Yes, I am.

Penny has dragged a chair in off
the street whose unknown provenance...

jeopardizes the health and welfare
of every resident in our building.

Just because you have a focus on
cleanliness bordering on the psychotic...

doesn't mean I have to participate.

All right. Name your price.

Kiss me
where I've never been kissed before.

You mean like Salt Lake City?

Never mind. I'll talk to Penny.

Thank you.

Will you listen to me
play my harp now?

No. I dislike the sound of the harp.

Its overuse
in classic television sitcoms...

always makes me think I'm going
to experience an episode from my past.

I'm sorry, Mommy. Don't be mad at me.
Don't do that.

I don't know about this, Howard.

What? You're having trouble
with the long-distance love-making.

This is your answer.

There are two interfaces
that simulate a human mouth.

You have one, Priya has one in India.
When you move your lips and tongue...

it transmits exactly
what you're doing to hers.

See? Internet kissing.

Give it a try.

I don't think so.

I'll try it.

Like this?

Almost.

Really get your tongue in there
to activate the motion sensor.

Like this?

 Close. Really French it.
 All right.

 Better?
 Yeah, you got it, you got it.

I'm impressed. This is very lifelike.

Whoa, you just bit my tongue.

Oh, I nibbled. I was being playful.

Why do you have to
make everything weird?

Sorry.

 Better?
 Oh, yeah.

Pretty cool, huh? Probably would have
cost, like, 200 bucks in a store.

I do appreciate a bargain.

This entire ensemble
once belonged to my dead grandmother.

 You're kidding?
 Everything except bra and panties.

They're a leopard-spotted secret
I share with Victoria.

And now me, heh.

I just have one question
about the chair.

And what's that?

Aren't you worried about it
being unhygienic?

No. It's completely fi...

Hmm.

I get it. Sheldon sent you.
He put you up to this.

 No, he didn't.
 Really?

Yes, he did, he absolutely did.

Oh, my God, Amy,
that's really crappy of you.

 It is?
 Yeah.

Letting Sheldon use you
to manipulate me?

I thought you were my friend.

No, I am your friend.
Please don't be mad at me.

I can't even believe this.
Maybe you should just go.

No, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I take it all back.

Look, I'm, uh... I'm sitting in your chair,
there's nothing wrong with it.

Please let me continue
to be part of your world.

Ow.

What's wrong?

Something in the chair is
biting my tushy. It's not importa... Ow.

Wait, wait, get up. Get up.


Swear you won't tell Sheldon!

I swear!

Can I tell my doctor?
I'm gonna need shots!

Yeah, sure!

Oh, hey, babe.
I think I've figured this thing out.

 Oh, Leonard, listen...
 No, you listen.

You're my woman and I'm gonna make
you feel things you've never felt before.

 Leonard...
 That's right, say my name.

And beg me for more
because I'm gonna give it to you.

My parents are here.

Hello, Leonard...

if I may also say your name.

 Check it out. Free chair.
 Yeah.

You know, if this was in Sheldon
and Leonard's apartment...

I wouldn't wind up sitting on the floor
all the time.

On three.


 Three.
 Three.

What kind of idiot throws away
a terrific chair like this?



Okay, Raj.

Hand me the #6 Torx screwdriver.

Stop.

We can't do this. It's not right.

Sheldon, you have two choices.

ther you let him put a
bigger hard drive in the TiVo,

or you delete stuff
before we go out of town.

But once you open the box,
you've voided the warranty.

The warranty is a sacred covenant we've
entered into with the manufacturer.

He offers to stand by his
equipment, and we in return

agree not to violate the
integrity of the internal hardware.

This little orange sticker is all
that stands between us and anarchy.

Okay, then we won't
touch the hard drive.

We'll just erase the
first season of Battlestar.

There. We're outlaws.

Here you go, Leonard. Is
this going to be big enough?

It's perfect.

For taking daffodils to your unicorn.

It's just for my
notebooks. Thanks, Penny.

I love San Francisco. I
wish I was going with you.

I understand your envy.
Thiss a can't-miss symposium.

There are going to be discussions on
bioorganic cellular computer devices,

the advancements in
multi-threaded task completion,

plus a roundtable on the
nonequilibrium Green's function approach

to the photoionization process in atoms.

When I go, I usually just get
hammered and ride the cable cars.

This conference is kind of a big thing.

The keynote address is being
delivered by George Smoot.

Oh, my God, the George Smoot?

 You've heard of him?
 Of course I haven't.

George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning
physicist, one of the great minds of our time.

His work in black body form and anisotropy
of the cosmic microwave background radiation

cemented our understanding
of the origin of the universe.

It's kind of a funny
name, though-- "Smoot."

It's like talking to a chimp.

Okay, now that I've been completely
insulted, have a good flight.

Yeah, I wish.

We're not flying.
We're taking the train.

Oh, cool.

Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as
flying, and costs almost twice as much.

Well, then why are you doing it?

Well, we had a vote. Three
of us voted for airplane.

Sheldon voted for train.
So we're taking the trn.

Don't say it like that, Leonard.

Say it like: We're taking the train!




Hey, we're all going over to the Apple store
to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar.

You want to come?

Oh, I always enjoy that,
but I'm a little busy.

What are you doing?

I'm simplifying the task
of packing for our trip.

See, by attaching RFID tags to my
clothing, it will able my laptop

to read and identify
the items with this wand.

I will then cross-reference them against
destination, anticipated activity spectrum,

weather conditions,
duration of trip, et cetera.

Well, that does sound much simpler.

How long is this going to take?

Assuming I can keep up this
pace, three hours, 11 minutes,

and plus however long tak to conclude
this fairly pointless conversation.

Teasing the guys at the Apple
store seems a little redundant now.

 I don't follow.
 I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later.

Socks:one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.

Socks: one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.

What on earth are you doing?

Whatever it is, I'm guessing
we're doing it wrong.

Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight,

one of the great American trains operating
on one of the classic American routes.

On this side, you'll see panoramic ocean vistas
inaccessible to any other form of transportation,

while on your side, you'll be
treated to 350 miles of CostCos,

Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock
homes with above-ground pools.

Come on, Raj.

What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?

No.

 Why not?
 That's over the wheelbase.

Are you completely unfamiliar
with the suspension characteristics

of a pre-1980 Pullman-built
Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?

Sheldon, we've been on
this train 90 seconds,

and you've already
said a thousand words.

Just tell us where to sit and shut up.

Here.

I'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the
steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails,

your sour disposition will abate.

Yeah, maybe.

Meanwhil back in the 21st century,
people are raising their tray tables

and putting their seat-backs in an upright
position 'cause it's time to land in San Francisco.

It's not so bad, really.

At least these trains
have modern plumbing.

In India, you squat over a hole in the
train and expose your naked buttocks

to the chilly air of Rajasthan.

He is referring, of course, to third class on
Indian Railways' magnificent Ranakpur Express

and its 1,200-kilometer journey from
Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.

Oh, look, now he's boring
on an international scale.

Holy crap! Look!

Is that who I think it is?

It can't be. What would Summer
Glau be doing riding the train?

Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's
protecting him from an evil Terminator.

Unlikely. That's a
television show, Leonard.

Thank you.

Of course, if SkyNet actually
did exist in the future,

a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy
mankind would be to send Terminators back posing

as actors who have played Terminators
in popular films and television series,

lulling us into a false
sense of security, i.e.,

"That's Summer Glau "from
The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

No, Summer, don't kill
me!" I'm pro-robot! Ahh!"

At least he's off the train crap.

Whee!

Sheldon, I owe you an apology.

Taking the train was
a stroke of brilliance!

I've actually got a
shot at a Terminator.

Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators,

you've got a better shot of
scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

You're overlooking something.

I have 11 hours with
her in a confined space.

Unless she's willing to jump off a moving
train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill,

she will eventually succumb to the
acquired taste that is ward Wolowitz.

My money's on tuck and roll.

I'm confused.

I thought you were involved in some sort of
socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.

 Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.
 All right.

 That's Summer Glau.
 Yes.

That's it.

Hang on a sec. Why do you
get first crack at her?

Um, well, let's see, couple
reasons. One, I saw her first.

No, you didn't. I did.

Fair enough. But... then,
let me move on to #2.

Unlike you, I can actually
talk to women when I'm sober.

You fail to take into account that
even mute, I am foreign and exotic,

while you, on the other
hand, are frail and pasty.

Well, you know the old saying,
Pasty and frail never fail.

Excuse me, but what about me?

Why don't I get a shot?

Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.

You know, I've already got a gorgeous
blonde back home at I can't score with.

I think I'll let you two take this one.

Sheldon, is there a place
on this train to get alcohol?

Interesting that you ask.

The Coast Starlight recently added
the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car.

Built in 1956 and originally
known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car,

 the lower level is a theater and
the upper level - Yeah-yeah, which way?

is a bar that offers wine tastings
if you're going as far as Portland.

So aren't you going to go talk to her?

I will, I'm just working
on my opening line.

She's probably heard every
possible line, Howard.

Why don't you just try "hello"?

No, no, no, that
always creeps girls out.

I need to come up with something that's
funny, smart and delicately suggests

that my sexual endowment is
disproportionate to my physical stature.

You're going to need more than 11 hours.

Oh, no.

What's the matter?

I forgot my flash drive.

 So?
 So we have to go back.

Okay, Sheldon, I'm going to say "why" and your
answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.

You don't understand.

My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical
probes of M-theory effects in the early universe

that I was going to give to
George Smoot at the conference.

Why do you have to give
your paper to George Smoot?

It's brilliant. He needs to read it.

So you'll send him an
e-mail when we get back.

Then I won't get to see his
face light up as he reads it.

Right. Of course.

Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.

Well, there's nothing you
can do about it, so relax.

Sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of
the steel wheels on the polished rails.

You forgot your flash drive

You forgot your flash drive

Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.

It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

So... where you gals headed?

Okay, I've found the perfect solution.

We get off the train at
the next stop in Oxnard.

We then take the 1:13
train back to Union Station.

We take a cab back to the apartment, get my
flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo,

where, assuming the lights are with us
and minimal traffic, we'll meet the train.

I've got a better idea.

Are you going to be sarcastic?

Boy, you take all the
fun out of it for me.

Look, Penny's home. Why don't we just
call her, have her go in the apartment,

get your flash drive
and e-mail you the paper?

 But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
 So?

 The key is hidden in my room.
 So?

 Penny would have to go into my room.
 So?

People don't go in my room!

I see. Well, it seems once again, you're
caught between a rock and a crazy place.

Oh, I te when that happens.

It's hot in here. It must be Summer.

It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

 That's cute.
 Really? I just made it up.

Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?

Oh, yeah, I loved it.

It's loosely based on my life.

Yeah, we're putting the play on for one night
in this little 99-seat theater. Can you come?

Oh, great.

Do you know 98 other people
that might want to come?

Oh, hang on.

 Hello?
 Listen carefully.

I'm about to give you a set of instructions,
which you must follow to the letter.

Just a sec.

The theater is above a bowling
alley, so it's a little noisy,

but it might be the only chance
I'll ever get to play Anne Frank.

And the director is brilliant.

He uses the bowling sounds
as, like, Nazi artillery.

Okay, great, I'll see you then. Hello?

Okay, step four.

Do you see that small
plastic case on my dresser?

Your dresser? Who is this?

It's Sheldon.

Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?

I'm not in San Francisco. I'm on a
train. Were you even listening to me?

Uh, no, I was talking to
my friend, but what's up?

What's up? I'll tell you what's up.

I'm in a crisis situation, and I need you
to marshal your powers of concentration,

 limited as they may be...
 Give me the phone.

Hi, Penny. It's Leonard.

Hey, Leonard. What's
going on with Dr. Wkadood?

He's calling to ask you a favor.

You might be confused because he didn't use the
words, Penny, "Sheldon," "please" or "favor."

Okay. Enough chitchat.

Okay, step one. Locate your
emergency key to our apartment.

Step two: enter our
apartment. Step three:...

Enter my broom.

 Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.
 No!

Leonard, let me tell you something.
Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.

And that bright little star
peeking her head out early today...

that's Venus.

That is so cool.

You really know a lot about space.

Come on. When you were on TV in
Firefly, you were actually in space.

You're not one of those guys
who really believe that, are you?

You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No.

Those are crazy people.

Howard, be a dear and get
me another one of these.

Now, him, he's one of those geeks.

All right, now, before you
enter my bedroom unescorted,

I need you to understand that this onetime grant
of access does not create a permanent easement.

Easement.

It's a legal right
of access. Good grief.

What? No, don't put me on hold.

Do you believe him?

Normally around women, he has the
personality of a boiled potato.

Put one beer in him, and
he's M. Night Charmalarmalon.

Is that what he's drinking?
It's not even real beer.

 What? - Look at it.
Non-alcoholic beer.

 What's going on?
 I don't know.

Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.

Placebo, you say. Interesting.

Yes, I'm still here. Where
am I going? I'm on a train.

Now, what you'll be looking for is a small
wooden box located between a Hoberman's sphere

and a sample of quartz
flecked with pyrite.

Hoberman's Sphere.

It's collapsible icosidodecahedron.

No, the thing with the time
on it is my alarm clock.

Actually, in India, the names
of constellations are different.

Where you have the Big Dipper,
we have the Big Curry Pot.

You're making that up.

You got me.

Now what are you going to do with me?

 Raj.
 Yes?

 Look.
 What am I looking at?

You tell me.

Non-alcoholic beer.

I'm the small package
good things come in.

Okay, I got a box, but
there's no key in here.

Just letters.

That's the wrg box. Put it back.

Oh, Sheldon, are these
letters from your grandmother?

Don't read those letters!

Oh, look, she calls you
"Moon Pie." That is so cute.

Put down the letters!

Hey, Penny. It's Leonard.

Hey, Leonard. How's the train ride?

Delightful.

Listen, I don't know what
you're doing right now,

but there are little bubbles forming
on the corners of Sheldon's mouth.

Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed
a line. Put him back on.

Thank you.

 I'm back.
 What up, Moon Pie?

Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!

Hey, Penny. Leonard again.

So anyway, in the dream, you and I
were ice skating, just the two of us.

And then, I picked you up by your
ankles and twirled you round and round

until your legs tore off.

I tried to stick them back
on, but before I could,

you turned into a giant
loaf of pumpernickel bread.

What do you think that means?

I really don't know.

I'll give you a little
clue. My favorite sandwich?

Salami on pumpernickel.

Is that so?

And did you know the word "pumpernickel" comes
from the German words "pumper" and "nickel,"

which loosely translates
to "fart goblin"?

No. I didn't.

Okay, I found the box. Now what?

You're holding a Japanese puzzle box,
which takes ten precise moves to open.

First, locate the panel
with the diamond pattern

and slide the center portion
one millimeter to the left.

Then, on the opposite end of the box,
slide the entire panel down two millimeters.

 You'll hear a slight click.
 Hang on.

Sheldon, do you have any
emotional attachment to this box?

No, it's a velty I ordered off the
Internet. Did you hear the click?

Not yet.

There it is.

Okay, here's another one.

If you married the famous rock guitarist
Johnny Winter, you'd be Summer Winter.

Yep.

Okay, I'm going to just go for
broke here and say I like you.

Yeah?

So here's my question: do you
realistically see any conversational path

that would take me from where
we are right now to a place

where I could ask you
out and you'd say yes?

No.

Fair enough. I'll leave you in peace.

Thank you.

But before I go,

would you mind if I just take one picture
of us together for my Facebook page?

Sure.

Okay. Great. Now, can I take one
where it looks like we're making out?

Okay, now you're going to insert
the flash drive into the USB port...

She calls me Moon Pie because I'm
nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up.

Now, please put the flash
drive in the USB port.

The one that looks like
a little duck's mouth.

Hey, how'd it go?

Terminator broke my phone.

Excuse me.

Okay, I'll be honest with you.

I've just spent the last two hours
imagining various scenarios in my head,

trying to come up with some
clever line to say to you.

But then I finally realized you're
a human being; I'm a human being.

 I could just say to you...
 Next stop: Santa Barbara.

I'm sorry. This is me.

Hi, my name's Leonard.

So, I'm thinking, you won the
Nobel Prize what, three years ago?

So you must deal with a whole lot
of "What has Smoot done lately?"

My thought is we continue
my research as aeam--

you know, Cooper-Smoot,
alphabetical--

and when we win the Nobel
Prize, you'll be back on top.

With all due respect, Dr.
Cooper, are you on crack?

Fine! Smoot-Cooper.

Wow, what a diva.


 It was a nice retirement party.
 I guess.

Still, it's a shame Professor Rothman
was forced to step down.

Well, what choice
did the university have? He snapped.

It happens to theoretical physicists
all the time.

I wonder how long Sheldon's got.

These shrimp are all the same size.

There's no logical order
to eat them in.

Can't be very long.

Hey, look,
there's Rothman's empty office.

 Sad.
 Yeah.

 Indeed.
 So sad.

Dibs.

What's up, fellas?

What are you doing here, Kripke?

Measuring my new office for drapes.

This is not your office.
It hasn't been assigned yet.

I called dibs at Christmas when
Rothman tried to have intercourse...

with the Toys for Tots
collection box.

Dibs? I mean, this is a university,
not a playground.

Offices are not assigned
because someone called dibs.

 You just called dibs.
 Shut it.

Offices are assigned by seniority.
I arrived at the university first.

I arrived at the office first.
I'm the proverbial early bird.

 Gentlemen.
 Mr. Rothman.

 Professor Rothman.
 Professor Rothman.

Good evening.

 See you.

I'm glad
that men are wearing hats again.

They're so distinguished.

 I got you a little something.
 A little something?

Oh, it...

What? This is huge.

What's huge is what you've done
for me.

Oh, no, Amy, I haven't done anything.

No, no. Before I met you,
I was a mousy wallflower.

But look at me now.

I'm like some kind
of downtown hipster party girl...

with a posse, a boyfriend...

and a new lace bra
that hooks in the front, of all things.

 Open it, open it.
 Okay.

I wanted to get you something
you didn't have.

Wow. I don't know what to s... Wow.

 Do you like it?
 Do I like it? Wow.

So where you gonna hang it?

Oh, my Go... Hang it. Wow. Um...

You know, I'd have to get a hook
and nails and a hammer, and...

 No problem.
 Oh, look.

You've got... You just...
You got it all right there. Wow.

I found him. He's in the bathroom.

 President Seibert?
 Can't this wait?

I'm sorry, we just need a word.

Now? You realize I'm your boss
and I am holding my penis.

Sheldon, give the man some privacy.

I'm sorry, this guy's got no respect
for boundaries.

What do you want?

Will you tell this lunatic
that Rothman's office is mine?

Take this up with your
department chairman.

His assistant said
he was on sabbatical.

Although, we distinctly heard
his office window open and shut.

Gentlemen, there's a task
I'm trying to accomplish here...

 ...and I'm having trouble doing it.
 Oh, my.

President Seibert,
I don't mean to be an alarmist...

but difficulty initiating
a urine stream...

could be a symptom
of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

If you're interested, I can send you a link
to a YouTube video...

that'll show you
how to perform your own rectal exam.

Yeah, helpful hint:
Trim your nails first.

Ignore him, President Seibert.

I'm sure a young man such as yourself
has a perfectly healthy prostate.

Oh, he's just trying to butter you up.

And for the record, butter is an excellent
lubricant for your rectal exam.

Gentlemen, I'm going to allow you
to work this out...

because, A,
you're brilliant scientists...

and, B,
as far as who gets Rothman's office...

I couldn't give the furry crack
of a rat's behind.

Well, as long as we're here,
I might as well take a leak.

 Kripke?
 Yes?

You're in my spot.


That is big.

So big.

 And ugly.
 So ugly.

What am I gonna do?

I don't know. You can't take it down.
You'll break her heart.

Look at that face.

That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.

Any chance I'll learn to love it?

That depends, do you like pictures
of yourself where you look like a man?

 All right. It's gotta go.
 What will you tell Amy?

How about I tell her the painting makes
you feel jealous because you're not in it?

Oh, nuh-uh. What if she gets me one?

I already have a picture of
me and Howard's mom...

getting our hair cornrowed
in Venice Beach. I've suffered enough.

I could take it down and put it up when
she comes over, but it's kind of heavy.

Too bad you're not as strong
as the dude in the painting.

Would you look at this?

I paid $25 to some kid on eBay
for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand.

He sent me a stick.

He went into his backyard,
he picked up a stick.

It's numbered. Heh.

Ooh. Limited edition. Nice.


 Oh, that'll be Kripke.
 What's he doing here?

We're going to work
this office situation out like gentlemen.

And if that doesn't work,
I'm going to poison his tea.

 Cooper.
 Kripke. Come in.

I'm making tea. Would you like a cup?

Am I wearing a summer frock?
No, I don't want tea.

Let's get down to brass tacks.

Fine. In the interest
of preserving our friendship...

 We're not friends.
 Well...

that's a little hard to hear,
but all right.

As you know, the essence of diplomacy
is compromise.

With that in mind,
I propose the following.

I will take Rothman's office...

and you will find a way
to be okay with that.

How about I take Rothman's office
and you go suck a lemon?


You sure I can't get you
that cup of tea?

How about you decide this with
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock?

What the frig is that?

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock...

was created by Internet pioneer
Sam Kass...

as an improvement
on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.

All hail Sam Kass.

Hail.

How does it work?

Oh, it's very simple.

Scissors cuts paper,
paper covers rock...

rock crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock...

Spock smashes scissors,
scissors decapitates lizard...

lizard eats paper,
paper disproves Spock...

Spock vaporizes rock...

and, as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.

I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

Well, of course.
Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock...

rock crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock...

Spock smashes scissors,
scissors decapitates lizard...

lizard eats paper,
paper disproves Spock...

Spock vaporizes rock...

and, as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.

Almost got it. One more time.

Scissors cuts paper,
paper covers rock...

Sheldon, stop.
He's screwing with you.

Is he?

Well, then,
seems we have reached an impasse.

I see no other option
than to challenge you to a duel.

I'd smack you with a glove, but just last
week, I packed away my winter things.

It's the 21st century,
you can't have a duel.

Hang on, Howard.

Barry, how good of a shot are you?

Not pistols. Minds.

A trivia contest.
And you may choose the field of battle.

Star Trek trivia,
Star Trek: Next Generation trivia...

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia,
Star Trek: Voyagertrivia...

or model trains.

You have an advantage in trivia.
You have an eidetic memory.

Plus, I haven't watched Star Trek...

since I discovered the strip club
near my apartment has a free buffet.

It's hard to find something
you're both equally good at.

Is there anything
you're equally bad at?

 Sports.
 Sports.

All right, this is one-on-one,
first to five wins the office.

Any questions? Yes, Sheldon.

Five what?

Balls in the basket.



That's out, right?

Time. Ran out of room.

You know those terrible things
bullies used to do to us?

 Yeah?
 I get it.


Hey!

 He did that on purpose.
 No, he didn't.

Nothing that's happening here
is being done on purpose.

Okay, forget one-on-one.
Let's try a free-throw contest.

First person who makes a basket
wins the office.

 Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.
 Nope. No, I'm not.

Use the Force, Sheldon.
Use the Force.

I'm gonna need more Force.

All right, Cooper.
Prepare to have your heart broken.


Do I get points for that?

Hah!


All right, we gave it 45 minutes.

It's no longer funny.
Let's try something else.

What do you propose?

Uh... On three, both of you
bounce the balls as hard as you can.

Highest bounce wins the office.

Oh, you are going down, Cooper.

I don't think so, Kripke.

I've bounced many a rubber ball
in my day.

All right. That's enough trash talk.

One, two, three.

Sheldon was higher.

Congratulations, Sheldon,
you win the office.

Who's unsatisfactory in PE now?

We go together

Like rama lama lama
Ke ding a de dinga a dong

Oh, what a great movie.

I cannot believe
you've never seen Grease.

My mother didn't allow me
to watch it.

She was afraid it might encourage me
to join a gang.

I gotta go. I gotta get up early.

My company's testing a new steroid
that doesn't shrink testicles...

and the last one there
has to do the measuring.

Guess I should get going too.

Good night, painting Penny.

Good night, real Penny.

Good night, real Amy.

You don't have to say good night
to painting Amy, she's never leaving.

 Good night, real Penny.
 Bye.

Good night, transvestite Penny.



Okay, let us take you off the wall.


Out of sight, out of mind.

I wish.

Can I borrow that movie?

Those singing hooligans
really got my motor running.

Sure, sure. Enjoy.

You get it back to me
when you can or...

You keep it.
It's just gonna be my gift to you.

Thank you. Wait...
Where'd the painting go?

 It's right over there.
 Why?

I have no idea. That is weird.

You hate it.

 No, no, no. It's just... it's a little big.
 I feel like an idiot.

You're not an idiot.
Just help me put it back up.

So you can just take it down
when I leave?

 I don't need your pity.
 Oh, Amy, come on.

I'm just glad
I didn't go for the sculpture.

Ahh. The spoils.

I see why victors love them.

I'm happy for you, Sheldon,
but I have to admit...

I'm going to miss
sharing an office with you.

Oh, of course you are.

Well, feel free to drop by any time.

 Thank you.
 Yeah. Call first.

Oh, hello.

Professor Rothman.

This isn't your office anymore.
You're retired.

I think the word you're looking for
is "invisible."

I came to say I'm sorry.

 Don't bother.
 Oh, Amy, please.

I'm so humiliated. I sat there the whole
time we were watching Grease...

 ...thinking you liked the painting.
 I know.

I was a fool from "summer loving"...

to the last "rama lama lama
ke ding a de dinga a dong."

You're absolutely right.

I should have been honest
and told you the gift was too much.

Yes, too much. Because our friendship
is fundamentally asymmetrical.

I clearly like you
more than you like me.

I don't think you put a number
on how much one person likes another.

I bought you a painting
that's 12 square feet in area.

There's a number.

Amy, come...

if you don't like feet, you can try dollars.
The painting set me back 3 grand.

Three gr...? Oh, my God.

Look, Amy, all you need to know
is you are my friend.

I don't wanna lose you out of my life.

I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble
believing you right now.

 Grab your hammer.
 No, damage is done.

Okay, look, I didn't wanna say this...

but the real reason
I took the painting down...

was because it made Bernadette
very jealous.

Oh, my goodness.

How could I have not seen that?

The painting is a constant reminder
that of the three of us...

she is the least cool.

Yeah, that's what it is, so...

 You have such a good heart.
 Oh. I try.

 Come on.
 Well, where are we going?

We're gonna put this back up.

What about Bernadette?

Oh, screw her. She's just lucky
we let her hang out with us.


What are you doing?

I'm trying to raise the temperature
in here...

before my nipples
tear through my shirt.

Why don't you
just turn up the thermostat?

Aha. Good question.

It turns out that the thermostat
for my new office isn't in my new office.

No, it's next door
in Professor Davenport's office...

who is currently enjoying the hot
flashes associated with menopause.

Why is there a hole here?

Why is there a hole in my new office?

I've narrowed it down
to two possibilities.

There was something in the wall
that someone outside the wall wanted.

Or the more disturbing...

there was something in the wall
that wanted out.

At least you got a window that opens.
That's nice.

Oh. Is it? Listen.


 What, you don't like wind chimes?
 No, I hate them, but it gets worse.


 There it is.
 The bird?

Yeah, it's completely out of tune
with the wind chimes.

 So?
 You don't get it, do you?

That's a mockingbird.
Mockingbirds can change their song...

which means
he's out of tune on purpose.

He's mocking me.


Oh, dear, there it is again.
Do you feel it?

The growing realization
that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.

No. The vibration.

We are directly
underneath the geology lab...

and they're running
their sieve shakers again.

Hey, gravel monkeys,
you need to shake rocks?

Try jiggling your heads around!

 Sheldon, relax.
 How can I relax?

My nervous system is being
stretched out like the strings of a harp...

and plucked by holes
and birds and wind...

and the low-hanging scrotum of the
difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.

If you're not happy,
just let Kripke have the office.

Wait, and let him win?
Do I look crazy to you?

We're trying to think down here,
you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!

And you,
the notes are C, D, E, G and A.

You pick one
or I'm chopping down that tree!

 How's that?
 Little higher on the right.

 Now?
 Little more.

No. That's got it.

Yeah, okay. That's good.

 I'll let you in on a little secret.
 Mm.

Originally, we were painted nude.

But I had him add clothes because
it was an unnecessary challenge...

to our heterosexuality.

Yeah, good call.

If you change your mind, all it
would take is some warm soapy water...

and a couple of sponges.

 You're talking about the painting, right?
 Sure.

Help! Somebody, help!

What happened?

I was trying to see what was in here
and my head got stuck.

Why would you do that?

It's called scientific curiosity.

Now go get butter.

Okay, okay. Hang in there.
I'll be right back.



 Who says that in the middle of sex?

I don't know.
It was the heat of the moment.

No, the heat of the moment is,
"Oh, yeah, just like that."

Not, "Will you marry me?"

on the Space Station...

so they're putting me
on an earlier launch.

 When?
 A week from Friday.

What? But we're getting married
that Sunday.

You're right. I can't go to space.
I have to get married.

No one can say that's not a good reason.
I'll call them back.

 Have the wedding when you get back.
 Your dad's gonna be furious.

There's no way he's gonna let us
postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.

I'll talk to him.
He won't say no to his little girl.

No, I... l should talk to him,
you know, man-to-man.

All right, look, I'm gonna level with you.
I'm terrified about going into space.

You know,
what if I don't make it back?

It's gonna be okay, son.

You really think so?

Of course.

A pretty girl like Bernadette?

She'll find a new guy.



 Hey, Mike?
 Yeah?

I changed my mind.
I don't wanna do this.

 Good one.
 Yeah, I'm a funny guy.

I also have a hysterical bit
planned for later...

where I pretend to cry
through the whole launch.




 Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?
 Two-eighty-nine...

right between
the Game Show Network at 288...

and the East Coast feed
of the Disney Channel on 290.

I love his eidetic memory. It's so sexy.

Sheldon, what are the ingredients
in Pringles?

Dried potatoes, vegetable oil,
corn flour, wheat starch...

maltodextrin, salt,
and my favorite ingredient of all...

uniformity.

The uterus quivers, does it not?

There's Howard's rocket...

 ...live from Kazakhstan.
 Oh, I'm so nervous.

I don't think I can watch.

You're nervous? I've been stress-eating
for four days. Look at me.

I'm wearing my fat pants.

Remarkable.

In just under a half hour,
200 metric tons of fuel will ignite...

in a controlled explosion
right beneath Howard's keister.

And all from a country whose entire
contribution to the global economy...

has been "Tetris"
and mail-order brides.

Give me those damn Pringles.



Okay, we're in the final countdown.

 How you doing over there?
 Good, good.

Quick question.
I missed it in the briefing.

How much urine do these suits hold?

Hey, Froot Loops,
wanna hit your fan switch?

Check.

He calls you Froot Loops
because of your very gay haircut?

No, it's because I live with my mom
and she makes me Froot Loops.

Go with gay story.
People are more accepting of that.

Actually, Froot Loops
just got married to a girl.

Congratulations.

Thanks.
We decided to do it before the launch.

You and Mrs. Loops
have a big wedding?

Not exactly.

Listen, if you don't mind,
I'm not really up for chatting.

I'm just gonna sit here quietly
and let my life flash before my eyes.


That went really quick.
Let me try it again.

Close your eyes. Put out your hand.
I got you something special.

Come on, Howard,
I'm not falling for that again.

No, here.

Oh, Howie, a little star.

It's beautiful.

Put it on me.

Okay, but I'm gonna have
to get it back from you...

so I can take it
to the international Space Station.

That way, when I come home...

you will have a star
that was actually in space.


Oh, my God.

Take that, every guy
who's ever bought you anything.

This is the most amazing gift
I've ever gotten.

Really? If you like it that much,
close your eyes and put out your hand.

supermarket to buy snacks for your trip!

Do you want me to get those
little boxes of Froot Loops you like?

No. When I eat Froot Loops,
the other astronauts make fun of me!

I don't wanna wait
until you're back to get married.

What?

I wanna be married to you
before you get in that rocket.

But I'm leaving in two days.

What about Apple Jacks?!

I don't need to take cereal!

What kind of breakfast do you think...

they're gonna give you in Russia?!

They invented blintzes! I'll be fine!

the light bulb in New Jersey!

It doesn't mean they hand them out
to you when you go!

We'll have a little ceremony
with just our friends.

We'll still have the big reception
with everyone when you get back.

Wow, okay, let's get married.


You know what?!

I'll buy you All-Bran in case
you get stopped up in outer space!

We decided to go down to city hall
this afternoon, get married...

and then have the reception
when Howard gets back.

 That's so great.
 Cool.

We know it's short notice,
but we'd love you all to come with us.

No, no, no,
this is not the wedding I wanted.

I wanna wear
my maid-of-honor dress...

walk down the aisle
with a hundred eyes on me...

while a string quartet plays
"The way You Look Tonight."

That wasn't our processional music.

Well, it was gonna be mine.

Thank you for the invitation,
but I have to decline...

because it doesn't sound like
something I'll enjoy.

Come on, it'll be fun.

That's what you said about
the Green Lantern movie.

You were 114 minutes of wrong.

So, what do you say, Amy?

 Can I wear my maid-of-honor dress?
 Seriously? Wear that thing to city hall?

It's all I have left.
You gonna take that from me too?

 Amy, you look great.
 I know.

Where'd you get a beer?

From that happy young couple over there
with all the tattoos.

Beautiful story. They're in rival
drug gangs and they're getting married.

Shh. No one can know.

Look at all these people in love.

Kind of gets you thinking, doesn't it?

It does, indeed.

Leonard, is it awkward
being here with Penny...

given that you recently
proposed to her?

 You proposed?
 I don't wanna talk about it.

Where'd he pop the question?
What'd you say?

 She said no. Can we drop it?
 Lt wasn't a real proposal.

 Why wasn't it a real proposal?
 He asked her during coitus.

Did you get down on one knee
or were you already there? Ha, ha!

Don't talk like that
on your wedding day.

Sorry, Ma... Bernadette.
Ma... Bern... You're my Bernadette.

 Good move telling Sheldon.
 Can't propose, can't talk to my friends.

Is there anything else
I'm not allowed to do?

All right, that's enough.
Today is not about you two.

Today is about Howard
and Bernadette and me.

Folks, can I have your attention?

It's 5:00.
We're gonna take three more couples.

The rest have to come back
on Monday.

 No.
 I got this.

Excuse me, but is there any way
you can squeeze us in?

See, I'm an astronaut
and I'm leaving for Russia on Sunday...

so I can take a Soyuz rocket
to the international Space Station.

Yeah, me too. I'll see you there.

I can't believe
we're not gonna get married.

I'm gonna go see if the couple at the
front of the line needs a maid of honor.

So I tell my wife,
"Get a dog, don't get a dog.

I'm not walking it, I'm not feeding it,
I'm not picking up after it."

You know you're gonna wind up
walking it.

I know.

Um, shouldn't you guys be talking
about space stuff instead of dogs?

Dimitri, Froot Loops
would be more comfortable...

if we talked about space stuff.

Okay. I'm going into space.

And when I come back,
I have to pick up a poodle crap.

Is that better?

Thanks.

You know, we could always drive
to Vegas and get married.

No, isn't that kind of tacky?

I know tons of people
who got married in Vegas.

 Are any of them still married?
 Yeah.

I mean, not to the same people,
but...

There's gotta be someplace special
we could do it.

Leonard, where did you envision
marrying Penny?

Will you shut up?

I know how to make it special.

I told you, we are not re-creating
the wedding from The Sound of Music.

Yes, you made that brutally
clear to me.

What I was going to suggest is...

if you're willing
to wait until Sunday morning...

the Google satellite
will be over Pasadena.

You can have your wedding
photographed from space.

 Whoa.

 Way to go, Raj.
 I keep telling you.

If I wasn't an astrophysicist,
I would've been a party planner.

It was always a coin-flip.

Okay, so we know
we're gonna do it Sunday morning.

Now we need to find a good place
for the satellite to see us.

How about our roof?

 Oh, I like that.
 That's great.

Oh, my gosh.

I can't believe my maid-of-honor dress
is gonna be on Google Earth.

So we have the where
and the when...

but we still need to figure out
who's gonna do the ceremony.

Anyone can go online
and get ordained as a minister.

I know a piercing parlor
where they'll marry you...

and stick a wedding ring
through any body part you want.

Right, well, who's it gonna be?

I'll do it, provided I can perform
the ceremony in Klingon.

No.

What do you see in her?


Leaking? What's leaking?

Fuel. Shh.


There's fuel leaking
and we're still gonna go?

Don't lose your Froot Loops,
Froot Loops.

This happens a lot.

Nine times out of 10, no problem.

 What happens on the 10th time?
 Problem.

Hey, guys, before I forget,
I got you a little groomsmen present.

 Thanks.
 You didn't have to.

Fantastic Four Annual Number 3
from 1965 in mint condition.

The one where Mr. Fantastic
and the invisible Girl get married.

Oh, wow.

Oh, dear.

 I was afraid of this.
 What?

While a thoughtful gift,
this comic book in this condition...

 ...is worth at least $100.
 Yeah, so?

I bought you and Bernadette
a gravy boat worth $88.

Which places me in your debt,
and I can't be in your debt...

because someday,
you might ask me to help you move...

or to kill a man.

I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.

Well, what if it's his only way out?
I can't risk it.

Here is $12.

Now we're even. Wait, wait, wait.

I bought a card. Give me $2.

For the record,
this is why I hate gift-giving.

 Lt's the groom.

You can't come in.
Bad luck to see the bride.

Okay, fine.

Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother!
I'll be right back!

Why can't she drive herself?

She doesn't wanna sit in her dress
and wrinkle it!

So I'm gonna lay her down
in the back of my neighbor's van!

All right, just hurry!

Okay, I'll see you later, Ma...
Uh, lovely bride-to-be!

I really gotta watch that.

Come on, Raj, we're ready to start.

We're ready when I say we're ready.


Oop. Ahem.

Okay. Now we're ready.

Ma, you wanna move your chair
over here so you can see?!

I don't wanna fall off the roof!

You'll fall through the roof
before you fall off it.

Penny?


Your new mother-in-law
is a piece of work.

Not now, Dad.

She's got a bigger mustache than me.

Here you go.

Here you go? What am I, a football?

Like that guy could catch a football.

"Howard and Bernadette,
the five of us stand before you...

as your friends
and newly ordained ministers."

Louder!

They all got ordained!
They're all marrying us! It's adorable!

If you wanna hear, come closer!

"Guys, when I look at the two of you
starting your lives together...

it fills my heart...

it fills my heart..."

Okay, I'm gonna need a minute.

Okay, I'll go. Ahem.

"Howard and Bernadette...

I know you two planned on getting
married in a big, fancy wedding.

When you're in love, it doesn't matter
where or how these things happen.

It just matters
that you have each other."

Hmm.

 Problem?
 No.

I think the Reverend Hofstadter
is making an ironic connection...

between your statement
about love...

and your rejection of his proposal
in the bedroom.

Oh, grow up.

 Hey, I didn't say it.
 That's enough.

 Well, he started it.
 Well, I'm ending it.

"Bernadette, I wanna thank you for
allowing me to be your maid of honor.

I also want you to know
that I will be happy to do it again...

if this marriage craps out."

Thank you, Amy. Very touching.

"Howard and Bernadette...

you are lucky enough
to be best friends who love each other.

And that's the strongest kind of love,
because at its core...

it has kindness, patience
and respect."

Qualities that are hard to find
in people these days.

Would you like some aloe vera?

You just got burned.

All right, my turn. Ahem.



Sheldon, I told you, no Klingon.

Fine, I'll do it in English,
but it loses something.

"The need to find another human being
to share one's life with...

has always puzzled me.

Maybe because I'm so interesting
all by myself.

With that being said, may you find
as much happiness with each other...

as I find on my own."

The Klingon would have made you cry.

I believe you two have prepared vows?

Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you,
this is going to be short and sweet.

I love you with all my heart and soul
and promise to be with you forever.

Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

Speak up!

Hey, from now on, she's the only
woman who can yell at me!

Until I met you, I couldn't imagine
spending my life with just one person.

And now I can't imagine spending
one day of it without you.

by the state of California...

And the Klingon High Council.

husband and wife.

That's ignition.

I love this part!

Me too!

I have strongly mixed feelings.

Oh, my God, it's happening.

 Did I miss it?
 No, come on in. Hurry.


I love that man.

Me too.

I can't believe it.

This whole time,
a small part of me thought he was lying.

This is it.

Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.





Clarify something for me.

Isn't the point

of a communal meal

the exchange of ideas
and opinions?

An opportunity to consider
important issues of the day?

It is.

You just kind of put
a damper on things

when you said,
"The next person I see talking

with food in their mouth
will be put to death."

Well, we could argue about
who said what all night long,

but to set things back
on course,

I will propose
a new topic of conversation.

Great.

What is the best number?

By the way, there's only
one correct answer.

5,318,008?

Wrong.

The best number is 73.

You're probably wondering why.

No. Uh-uh.
We're good.

73 is the 21st prime number.

Its mirror, 37, is the 12th,
and its mirror, 21,

is the product of multiplying--

hang on to your hats--
seven and three.

Eh? Eh? Did I lie?

We get it.

73 is the Chuck Norris
of numbers.

Chuck Norris wishes.

"one-zero-zero-
one-zero-zero-one"

which backwards is "one-zero-
zero-one-zero-zero-one"--

exactly the same.

All Chuck Norris backwards
gets you is: "Sirron Kcuhc."

Just for the record,

when you enter 5,318,008
on a calculator,

upside-down it spells "boobies""

Remember when you were wondering

why the girls didn't
want to eat with us tonight?

Yeah, I get it now.

I love your little
heart locket, Bernadette.

Oh, thanks.

Howard gave it to me.

It's the cutest thing.

Every time I have
dinner with his mom,

the next day I get jewelry.

Did you know that the iconic
Valentine's heart shape

is not actually based
on the shape of a human heart,

but rather on the shape
of the buttocks

of a female bending over?

Oh, so I spent seventh grade

dotting my I's
with little asses?

Cool.

Hey, Penny, how's it going?

Hey, Zack,
what are you doing here?

My dad's company prints
the menus for this place.

I'm just dropping off
some new ones laminated.

Makes 'em easier to clean
if people throw up on 'em.

Guess how I got the idea?

Yeah, I got it, I got it.

Uh, Zack, these are
my friends Bernadette and Amy.

 Hi.
 Hey.

Hoo.

Okay, well, it was
good to see you.

Yeah, you, too.

He's really cute.
How do you know him?

Oh, we went out
a couple of times.

I'm often flummoxed
by current slang.

Does "went out" mean
"had intercourse"?

Yes.
No, no.

But in this case, yes.

Interesting.

And was it not satisfactory?

No, it was great.

He just didn't really challenge
me on an intellectual level.

Couldn't you just fool around
with him and then listen to NPR?

Wouldn't help. Zack
can't even spell NPR.

It's what I do with Howard.

I'm much smarter than he is.

But it's important
to protect his manhood.

Hoo.

What's the matter?

I'm suddenly feeling flushed.

My heart rate is elevated,
my palms are clammy,

my mouth is dry.

In addition, I keep
involuntarily saying "hoo."

Oh, we know what's
causing that, don't we?

It's no mystery.

I obviously have the flu

coupled with sudden-onset
Tourette's syndrome.

 


Did you hear about the
accident at the bio lab?

No.
What happened?

They were injecting rats
with radioactive isotopes

and one of the techs got bit.

Did he get superpowers?

No, he got five stitches
and a tetanus shot.

Oh. Well, that's disappointing.

Why?

Well, you get bit by a
radioactive animal in a lab,

you kind of want to turn
into a superhero.

Yeah, but who'd want
to become Rat-Man?

Who wouldn't?

You could zip through
a maze in nothing flat,

squeeze through
really small holes,

and shut down restaurants
in a single bound.

And the best part is,
if I were Rat-Man,

you could be my
sidekick, Mouse Boy.

Mouse Boy?

You don't like "Mouse Boy"?

How about "Kid Vermin"?

First of all,
if we had superpowers,

I wouldn't be the sidekick.
You'd be the sidekick.

Rat-Man is nobody's sidekick.

Leonard, settle this.

Of the two of us, who's
the obvious sidekick?

Yeah, Leonard, who?

12 years after high school,
and I'm still at the nerd table.

Aren't you slicing that
man's brain a little too thin?

It's too thin if I were making

a foot-long brain sandwich
at Quiznos.

For examination under a two-
photon microscope, it's fine.

Well, you're the expert.

If the correct way to do it
is the wrong way, then I yield.

Very well.

If you die and donate
your body to science,

I promise to slice your brain
like Canadian bacon.

Thank you.

Now, if you'll
excuse me,

I have to take my temperature.

Are you monitoring
your circadian rhythms

in order to identify your periods
of maximum mental acuity?

I did that one summer.

Ah, youth.

No, I experienced some
distressing symptoms last night,

so I'm checking
my vital signs every hour.

I'd be happy to create a chart

and participate in a
differential diagnosis.

Oh, that sounds like fun.

All right.

What were the symptoms?

Elevated heart rate,
moist palms, dry mouth

and localized
vascular throbbing.

Localized to what region?

Ears and genitalia.

Interesting.

Not body parts
that usually team up.

What about
environmental factors?

Describe the scene for me.

I was sitting in a restaurant
with Penny and Bernadette,

drinking water-- carbonated
as it was a special occasion.

Penny's friend Zack stopped by
and said hello and I said "hoo."

Who?

Zack.

Then why did you ask?

Ask what?
Who.

Zack.

All right, let's start over.

What did you say
when Zack walked in?

"Hoo."
Zack.

Why do you keep saying "Zack"?

Because you keep saying "who."

I'm not saying "hoo" now.

I said "hoo" last night.

And the answer was Zack,
correct?

There was no question.

I simply said "hoo."

All right, I think
I have enough to go on.

Possible explanations
for your symptoms are,

in descending order
of likelihood:

hyperthyroidism,
premature menopause,

hosting an alien parasite or--

and I only include it
for the sake of covering

absolutely all bases--
sexual arousal.

Where would I have picked up
an alien parasite?

There you are.

Oh, hey.

Let me ask you a question.
What are you most afraid of?

I don't know. Um...

Nuclear war.

Accidentally being
buried alive.

Any of those movies where
you get that phone call

that says you're
going to die.

And then you do.

No. Something very specific

that we both know you,

Rajesh Koothrappali,
are terrified of.

Well, type two diabetes
runs in my family.

The thought of
losing a toe...

Spiders!
You're afraid of spiders!

What the heck is this?

A jar with a big spider
in it, of course.

Bravery test.

First one to take his hand out
is the sidekick.

Are you crazy?

Perhaps.

Are you scared?

No. But it's a stupid test.

Oh, really?
What if the earth was in danger

and the only way to save it was

to stick your hand
in a jar with a spider?

Oh, yeah?
What if the earth was in danger

and the only way
to save it was to take a shower

in the locker room and let
other guys see you naked?

Oh, come on.
That's never gonna happen.

Put your hand
in the jar

or forever be revealed
as my sidekick.

All right, I will.

How did you get so brave
all of a sudden?

It's easy.

The spider's crawling
up your arm.

Get it off! Get it off!

Please, Raj!

Please.

Oh!

My blood work shows
thyroid function normal.

Cortisol levels normal.

How about your

follicle-stimulating hormone
levels?

Sheldon, I am not going
through menopause.

Are you sure?

You said that with
the testy bark of an old biddy.

I think we need
to face the cold, hard truth:

I was sexually aroused
by Penny's friend Zack.

Hang on. I don't know

that we've given
the alien parasite hypothesis

a fair shake.

Let's look at this logically.

I have a stomach; I get hungry.

I have genitals; I have the
potential for sexual arousal.

A cross we all must bear.

You know, in difficult
moments like this,

I often turn to a force
greater than myself.

Religion?

Star Trek.

Did you see
Star Trek: The Motion Picture?

No.
Don't. It's terrible. However...

in it, we learn that

when Spock finds himself
drawn off the path of logic

by feelings bubbling up from his
human half, he suppresses them

using the Vulcan mental
discipline of Kolinar.

Are you suggesting
we live our lives

guided by the philosophies
found in cheap science fiction?

"Cheap science fiction"?

What are you doing?

Using Kolinar to suppress
my anger at that last comment.

Is it possible that your
concern for me at this moment

is motivated by nothing more
than simple jealousy?

I hadn't considered that.

Give me a moment.

All right, I've considered it.

And?
I reject it.

You reject it because
you don't feel jealousy,

or because you are
suppressing jealousy?

I think
I'll eat my lunch at home.

That's not your
lunch, Sheldon;

those are the cadaver
brain specimens.

Oh.

As they were incorrectly sliced,

you can see how I could
mistake them for my sashimi.

Hello.

Hey. Isn't tomorrow
your usual laundry night?

The supermarket was out of
my regular fabric softener.

If this one under-
or over-softens,

I'll need time
to make things right.

That's thinking ahead.

The alternative would be
to think backwards.

That's just remembering.

So how's Amy?

Amy's changed.

I might have to let her go.

Oh, no. Why?

I thought she was
a highly evolved creature

of pure intellect, like me.

But recent events indicate that

she may be a slave
to her baser urges.

Like you.

Just going to
skip over that insult.

What insult?

Yeah. That's why
I'm going to skip over it.

Are you saying that Amy is...

oh, what's the
scientific word...

Forget science. She's horny.

Oh! Okay. Wow.

It's simple biology. There's
nothing I can do about it.

Are you sure?

What are you suggesting?

I'm suggesting there
might be something

you could do about...
Amy's urges?

It's illegal to spay
a human being.

Yeah. That's not
what I had in mind.

Oh.

Oh!

You mean...
something I could do.

Exactly.

Well, I was hoping
to avoid this.

But I might as well
get it over with.

Thank you, Penny.

I'll let you
know what happens.

Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.

Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Is this the Zack Johnson

who used to have coitus
with my neighbor Penny?

Sorry to bother you.

Hello. I'm looking
for a Zack Johnson

who used to have coitus
with my neighbor Penny.

Coitus. It means intercourse.

And I have a feeling I'm
speaking to the right Zack.

This is Sheldon Cooper.

Fine. Shelly.

Yes, that does
sound like a girl's name.

No, it doesn't bother me.

Yes, "Smelly Shelly"
does bother me.

Let me tell you why I'm calling.

I'd like to know
if you'd be interested

in having sex
with Amy Farrah Fowler.

Amy Farrah Fowler.

Yes, that is  a girl's name.

Good grief. It's like trying
to talk to a dolphin.

Really?

This is going to decide who's
the hero and who's the sidekick?

You got a better idea?

Every idea is better
than this idea.

Ding!

Wait. What the hell is "ding"?
It's a bell.

I don't think this
kind of wrestling has a bell.

Fine. How do you
want to start?

I say, uh, how about
one, two, three, go?

One-two-three-go?
That's for babies.

Okay, how about, uh...

On your mark, get set, go?

That's for a footrace.
If you want to race,

we have to go outside.

No, it's chilly outside.
Didn't bring my jacket.

Oh, for crying out loud.

What kind of superhero
needs a jacket?

What kind of superhero says,
"Dibs on the red tights!

Dibs on the red tights!"

All right, how about this?
Ready, wrestle.

Wait. Are we starting now? Or
is that what you're going to say

when we do start, or...
We're starting now!

Don't yell at me!

Suppose there are worse ways
to spend a Friday night.

None come to mind.

Look at this stamp.
On what authority

are they permitted to
mutilate patrons as they enter?

I'm sure it'll wash off.

Little comfort tonight.

I look like a Hell's Angel.

There's Zack.

Are you sure this is
what you want to do?

It's not what I want to do;

it's what I have to do.

Go, Amy Farrah Fowler.

Follow your endocrine system.

Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.

Please don't drag this out.

This is never going to come off.

Excuse me?

Zack, I am Amy Farrah Fowler.
We met the other night.

I have spent my life in
pursuit of pure knowledge.

Until I met you,
my decisions

were founded in
logic and reason.

And yet here I stand before you,
130 pounds of raging estrogen,

longing to grab hold
of your gluteus maximus

and make Shakespeare's
metaphorical

beast with two backs.

My gluteus what?

On the other hand,

as I look at the blank, ape-like
expression on your face,

I have decided to adopt the
Vulcan practice of Kolinar.

Good-bye, Zack.
Bye.

Hoo.

That should hold me for a while.

I'm legally obligated
to inform you

that I took a karate lesson
when I was 11.

I'd be a regular ninja by now

if my mom could've
arranged a carpool.

Oh, yeah?

Well, I've been taking
Pilates class at the rec center,

and my abs look like
sections of a Hershey bar.

Oh, yeah? Won't matter,
you're going down!

No, uh-uh, you're going down!

If anybody's going to go down,
it's going to be you.

Fellas. It's been 30 minutes.
Nobody's touched each other.

I'm glad you decided to reject
your animal hindbrain

and return to the
realm of pure intellect.

As am I.

What are you doing?

An experiment.

Nope. Nothing.
Never mind.

You realize you can't win.

I prefer to think
that I can't lose.

You're wrong.

It's only a matter of time

before you fall into
Rat-Man's rat trap.

You pathetic fool!

If there were a rat-catcher,
wouldn't it catch Rat-Man?

Just because I didn't
express myself well

doesn't mean my
underlying point was invalid!

You bloviating buffoon!

You narcissistic nincompoop!

You crimson coward!

Oh, Leonard, wake up,

you're missing some very
excellent superhero quips.



So two years later,
there's a knock on the door.

Guy opens it, and there is the snail...

who says,
"What the heck was all that about?"

I don't really get it.

Well, see, it took two years
for the snail to...

Not important.

 Can I ask you a question?
 Sure.

Where do you think this is going?

To be honest,
I was hoping at least second base.

You're so funny.

You're like a standup comedian.

A Jewish standup comedian,
that would be new.

Actually, I think a lot of them
are Jewish.

No, I was just... Because... Never mind.

Look, Howard, this is our third date,
and we both know what that means.

 We do?
 Sex.

You're kidding.

But I need to know whether
you're looking for a relationship...

or a one-night stand.

Okay, just to be clear,
there's only one correct answer, right?

I mean, it's not like "Chicken or fish?"
on an airplane?

Maybe you need to think about it
a little.

Well, you know, it's not unheard of...

for a one-night stand
to turn into a relationship.

Call me when you figure it out.

Three dates means sex?

Who knew?

Greetings, homeys.

Homette.

Why are you back from your date
so early?

Well, in romance, as in show business,
always leave them wanting more.

 What exactly does that mean?
 He struck out.

Hey, did you know
that three dates with the same woman...

is the threshold for sex?

Actually, I've never had three dates
with the same woman.

With Penny and me, it took two years.

But now that I think about it,
that was three dates.

Okay, well,
before you and Penny hooked up...

did she ask
for any kind of commitment?

No, she was pretty clear
about wanting to keep her options open.

I have something to announce,
but out of respect for convention...

I will wait for you
to finish your conversation.

What are you talking about?

The cultural paradigm in which
people have sex after three dates.

I see.

Now, are we talking "date"
the social interaction...

or "date" the dried fruit?

Never mind.
What's your announcement?

Oh, good, my turn.

Well, this is very exciting, and I wanted
you to be among the first to know...

I hear you're gonna be on the radio...

with Ira Flatow from Science Friday
next week.

Thank you, Kripke...

for depriving me of the opportunity
to share my news with my friends.

My pleasure.

 My thank-you was not sincere.
 But my pleasure is.

Let me ask you a question.

At what point
did National Public Radio...

have to start scraping the bottom
of the barrel for its guests?

Eeh-eeh. Don't answer. It's rhetorical.

Well, why are you such a stupidhead?

That is also rhetorical.

I'm sorry you had to hear that.

Are you really gonna be on NPR?

Yes, they're interviewing me by phone
from my office...

regarding the recent so-called discovery
of magnetic monopoles in spin ices.

It's pledge week, and they're trying
to goose the ratings with controversy.

 Very cool. Congratulations.
 Thank you. My mother is very excited.

She's convening her Bible study group
to listen in...

and then pray for my soul.

I was on the radio once.

I called into Fever 104 FM New Delhi...

and was the fourth person
to say the phrase that pays:

"Fever 104:"

That means "Fever 104:
Home of the really good current music."

It's much catchier in Hindi.

All right, these are the talking points
for my NPR interview tomorrow.

I need to make
sure they're simple enough...

for the less educated in the audience
to understand.

Howard, look this over
and tell me what's unclear to you.

I have a Master's in engineering from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

It required the completion of 144 units
of grad work and an original thesis.

Yes.

Look this over
and tell me what's unclear to you.

You know, when Sheldon gives you
homework, you don't have to do it.

In fact, it's better if you don't.
Otherwise, the rest of us look bad.

 Hi, guys.
 Hello.

Yo, Raj, talk to me.

I'm sorry, just screwing with you.

Hey, Howard,
why haven't you called Bernadette?

Did she say something?

Said she hasn't heard from you.
I thought you liked her.

I do, you know,
but she wants a commitment...

and I'm not sure she's my type.

She agreed to go out with you for free.
What more do you need?

Look, Bernadette is really nice.

I just always thought when I finally
settled down into a relationship...

it would be with someone,
you know, different.

Different how?

Well, you know, more like Megan Fox
from Transformers...

or Katee Sackhoff
from Battlestar Galactica.

Are you high?

You'd have a better shot with the
three-breasted Martian from Total Recall.

Okay, now you're just being unrealistic.
Anyway, that movie was 20 years ago.

Imagine how saggy
those things would be.

You're gonna throw away a great girl
like Bernadette...

because you're holding out
for some fantasy?

Hey, just because you settled
doesn't mean I have to.

Excuse me, I'm sitting here.

Hey, I did not settle for Leonard.

I mean, obviously, he isn't
the kind of guy I usually go out with.

You know, physically.

Again, I'm right here.

I do not judge a book by its cover.
I am interested in the person underneath.

I am here, right? You see me?

Hey, I'm interested
in what's inside people too.

But, you know, why is it wrong
to want those insides wrapped up...

in, say, the delicious caramel
that is Halle Berry?

Yes, you're delicious caramel too.

I will tell you why it's wrong...

 Excuse me, may I interject?
 What?

Biologically speaking,
Howard is perfectly justified...

in seeking out the optimum mate
for the propagation of his genetic line.

Thank you, Sheldon.

Whether that propagation
is in the interest of humanity...

is an entirely different question.

This is Ira Flatow and
you're listening to NPR's Science Friday.

Joining us today by phone
from his office In Pasadena, California...

Is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Oh, this is gonna be a riot.

Thanks for being with us today,
Dr. Cooper.

My pleasure, Ira.

Now, let's talk
about magnetic monopoles.

Can you explain to our audience
just what a monopole Is?

Of course.

First, consider an ordinary magnet,
which has, as even the most uneducated...

in your audience must know, two poles...

a north and south pole.

If you cut that in half,
you have two smaller magnets...

each with its own north
and south pole.

Dr. Cooper, I think there might be
something wrong with our connection.

No, I hear you fine.

As I was saying,
an ordinary magnet has two poles.

The primary characteristic
of a monopole...

is that it has only one pole,
hence, "monopole."

A requirement for string theory,
or M-theory, If you will...

is the existence of such monopoles.

I myself led an expedition to the
Arctic Circle In search of said particles.

Kripke, I found the nozzle.
I'm going to kill you.

So nice you could join me this evening.
You're looking lovely as always.

Thanks, Howard.

Always nice to be part
of your masturbatory fantasies.

Come on, Katee,
don't make it sound so cheap.

I'm sorry. Fiddling with yourself
in the bathtub is a real class act.

Thank you.

So, ahem, shall we get started?

Sure, but can I ask you
a question first?

You wanna play Cylon and colonist?

No, I wanna know why
you're playing make-believe with me...

when you could be out
with a real woman tonight.

 You mean Bernadette?
 No, I mean Princess Leia.

Of course I mean Bernadette.

She's a wonderful girl
and she really likes you.

 I know, but she's not you.
 I'm not me.

The real me is in Beverly Hills
with a tall, handsome rich guy.

 Really? Tall?
 Six-four.

Ouch.

You've got a wonderful girl in your life,
and you're ignoring her...

to spend your nights in the bathtub
with a mental image and a washcloth.

Howard!

What are you doing in there?

I'm taking a bath!

I hope that's all you're doing!
We share that tub!

Don't remind me!

Oh, man.

All soaped up and no place to go.

How you doing, buddy?

I was humiliated on national radio.
How do you think I'm doing?

Come on, it wasn't that bad.

What do you want?

We represent
the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.

 Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.
 It wasn't funny.

I thought it was funny.

 Raj.
 You laughed.

Did you laugh?

I fell on the floor.

All right, he got you.
You can get him back.

 I refuse to sink to his level.
 You can't sink.

With all that helium in you,
you're lucky you don't float away.

Are you really admitting defeat?

 I never admit defeat.
 Good.

However, on an unrelated topic,
I'm never getting out of this bed again.

What if you could make Kripke
look even sillier than he made you look?

 I don't think that's possible.
 You're not helping.

I didn't come to help. I came to mock.

Sheldon, what you need to do...

is figure out a way
to exact vengeance on Kripke, like...

Like how the Joker got back at Batman...

for putting him in the Arkham Asylum
for the Criminally Insane.

He didn't stay and talk about his feelings
with the other villains.

He broke out
and poisoned Gotham's water supply.

Well...

I suppose I could poison Kripke.

 No, no.
 It's a simple matter.

There are several toxic chemicals
that would be untraceable in an autopsy.

Okay, that's the spirit...

but let's dial it back
to a nonlethal form of vengeance.

Oh.

How about we put a whoopee cushion
on his office chair?

He'll sit down and it'll sound
like he's flatulent even though he's not.

Let's keep thinking.

Oh, gee, you're too late.

Scarlett Johansson
and Wonder Woman were here...

trolling around
for neurotic little weasels.

I came to talk to Bernadette.
She's working today, right?

 I don't think she wants to see you.
 Why not?

Come on. You hurt her feelings
by not calling her all week.

Plus, I've been kind of talking
some smack about you.

 Hello, Howard.
 Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.

 I can't. I'm working.
 This will only take a second.

You asked me to think about
where our relationship was going...

and I did.

Bernadette...

will you marry me?

Is this more comedy
that I don't understand?

No, I'm serious.

I'm never gonna find another girl
like you...

who likes me and is, you know, real.

 So this isn't a joke?
 No.

Then you're insane.

I prefer to think of myself as quirky.

Howard, we've only been on three dates.
We haven't even had sex yet.

Fair enough. When's your break?

Wow.

Don't you just hate
when this happens?

Wow.

All right, how's this for revenge?

A solution of hydrogen peroxide
and one of saturated potassium iodide.

 What's this?
 Mountain Dew.

Ah. Refreshing.

Now, we're going to combine these
chemicals with ordinary dish soap...

creating a little exothermic release
of oxygen.

 Foamy vengeance.
 Yes, exactly.

This is brilliant, Sheldon.

How are we gonna deploy it
in Kripke's office?

Already taken care of. Observe.

This is a live shot of Kripke's lab
via a mini webcam I was able to install...

thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed
in the night janitor's shirt pocket.

At the same time, I also secured
large quantities of these chemicals...

above the tiles in the drop ceiling.

Sheldon, you remind me
of a young Lex Luthor.

You flatter me, sir.

 Let me guess, motion sensors?
 Yes.

The reaction will be triggered when
Kripke reaches the center of the room.

Mwa, ha, ha.

I gotta say, I am really impressed.

This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way
to get even.

It may be low-tech...

but I still maintain
the whoopee cushion has comic validity.

Here comes Kripke.

Who's that with him?

I believe that's the president
of the university.

 The board of directors. Abort! Abort!
 There is no abort.

 How could you not put in an abort?
 I made a boo-boo, all right?

I think the board will really appreciate
how well we're using that NSA grant.

Right here
we have a micro-controlled plasma...

Wow.
Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.

At least they don't know it was you.

Hello, Kripke.

This classic prank comes to you...

from the malevolent mind
of Sheldon Cooper.

If you'd like to see the look
on your stupid face...

this video is being Instantly uploaded
to YouTube.

Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter
and Raj Koothrappali...

for their support and encouragement
In this enterprise.

Well, I'm going back to India.
What's your plan?

 Hey, here's your tip from Table 7.
 Oh, thanks.

 Mm-hm.
 Testing. Check. Check two.

Oh, now what?

 You want me to throw him out?
 No, that's okay.

Are you sure? He's small.

Bet I could get a nice tight spiral
on him.

I wanna dedicate this number
to a great gal who I've done wrong.

Bernadette

I am so sorry
For trying to propose to you

Bernadette

You found It creepy
But that's just the kind of thing I do

Ahhh

I know now It was too soon
To talk of love

It was just a crazy idea
That came to me In my tub

But, Bernadette
Give me one more chance

Sweet Bernadette

I'll get the hang of this thing
They call romance

Sweet Bernadette

I dream to once again
Kiss your lips

Sweet Bernadette

Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz

Bernadette

Oh, I am so sorry.

Are you kidding?

That's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever done for me.

Bernadette

Thank you, Cheesecake Factory.



 Who wants the last dumpling?
 Ooh, me.

Penny, a moment.

We just had Thai food.

In that culture, the last morsel
is called the krengjai piece.

And it is reserved for the most important
and valued member of the group.

Thank you all for this high honor.

I've seen pictures of your mother.
Keep eating.

All right, honey, if we're gonna
make the movie, we should go.


This may be hard for you to hear...

but when I say "honey,"
I mean my fiancée.


Yeah, well, now it means her.

It's okay if he wants to come.

Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.

 I gotta to work. I'll walk down with you.
 Wait.

Uh, which is closer
to the new train store in Monrovia?

The movie theater
or The Cheesecake Factory?

Neither of them are close.

I guess it doesn't matter
which one of you drives me.

Let's play a fun guessing game
to see who gets to take me.

All right. This four-letter word
describes either a printer's type size...

or a compulsion to eat dirt.

 Okay, I'm not driving him.
 Penny, don't give up, you can get this.

Aren't you going with Sheldon?

No, I have no interest in model trains,
stores that sell them...

nor their heart-breaking clientele.

Oh, well, I have some work to do,
so...

I can't imagine that would disturb me.
Carry on.

Okay. Wouldn't you be
more comfortable at home?

Not really, no.

Alrighty then.
I guess I'll just get started.

Please, I don't need
the running commentary.


 Amy?
 Yo.

 You okay?
 Oh, sure.

 I thought you were reading.
 I was.

Now I'm thinking about what I read.

You all right, Leonard?
You seem very uncomfortable.

I... I'm fine.

Should I go?

I've been told sometimes
I overstay my welcome.

What...? Who told you that?

Well, most recently, my gynecologist.

Oh, you stay as long as you'd like.

I'm glad to hear you say that
because I'm having a wonderful time.

Hmm. I said the same thing
to my gynecologist.

What are you gonna get
at the train store, Sheldon?

Oh, I'm not buying anything.

They're having a lecture.

"HO gage railroading.

Half the size of O gage,
but twice the fun."

It's a very controversial topic.

 Which side do you come down on?
 I'll let you know after tonight.

Unlike some people,
I'm going in with an open mind.

Who am I kidding?

Of course we all know
it's O gage or no gage.

Can you believe grown men
sit around and play with toy trains? Heh.

That's big talk...

for a man with a closet full
of magic tricks at his mother's house.

First of all, they're not tricks.
They're illusions.

Secondly, when we get married,
they're all going up in the attic...

so you can have that closet
for clothes.

Why would I keep clothes
at your mother's house?

Well, don't think of it that way.

Once we move in, it'll be our house.

Is she moving out?

Why would she move out?
It's her house.

Hang on. You seriously think
I'm gonna live with your mother?

Howard, I think I can help here.

Yes, Bernadette,
that's exactly what he thinks.

Why not?
It's a great house, plenty of room.

If we have kids, Mom's there to help.
When she tells "The Three Little Pigs"...

she actually has hair
on her chinny chin chin.


I'm not gonna live with your mother.
Not now, not ever.

Wow, someone obviously has
some mommy issues.

Raj, take me home.

Don't listen to her.
Go to the movie theater.

 Take me home now.
 Movie theater.


Okay, everybody, calm down.
There is a simple solution here.

Raj, take me to the train store...

and then I don't care
what you people do.

How was your shower?

Good, good.

Just out of curiosity,
what time do you usually go to bed?

Oh, I'm up all night.
I'm like a possum.

Boy, you were not liked in high school,
were you?

 Not really. Is that my yearbook?
 Mm-hm.

"Dear Leonard,
you're really good at science.

Maybe one day you'll come up
with a cure for being a dork."

It wasn't spray-painting
a lightning bolt on my briefcase.

 I can tell you that.
 If it makes you feel any better...

the only person who signed
my yearbook was my mother.

Aw.

"Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are
better than friends and fun. Love, Mom."


Well, you can add Jerry's Junction
to the list of train stores...

Sheldon Cooper
will never set foot in again.

 Rough night, Casey Jones?
 You don't know the half of it.

It was billed as a lively give-and-take
on the merits of model-train sizes.

But it was actually a set-up...

to intimidate weak-minded, spineless
rubes into buying HO starter sets.

 What's in the bag?
 I don't wanna talk about it.

But it's not a spine, I'll tell you that.

I had a delightful evening.
We should do this again sometime.

Uh, sure. That'd be nice.

Glad to hear it. I need someone
to accompany me to the wedding...

of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson
this Friday.

They're kind of the Brad and Angelina
of the Primatology Department.

 Wouldn't you rather bring Sheldon?
 I would...

but the last wedding we went to
was a disaster.

 He behaved like a child the entire time.
 It's not my fault.

You said there'd be other scientists there
my age.

Doesn't matter. You're out. He's in.

No date to the prom,
two dates to a wedding.

Hmm, how times change.

Ha, ha, you have to go to a wedding.


I'll get it.



Oh, hi.

Hey.

I don't wanna fight.

I was just surprised when you sprung
the living-with-your-mom stuff on me.

Yeah, well,
I'm sorry I didn't run it by you first.

who you're talking to, but in or out!

We don't need bugs!

The bugs only come here...

because you're their queen!

Listen, how about this?

Before we make any decision
about where we live, we have a trial run.

You know, stay here for a weekend,
see what it's like.

 Your mom would be okay with that?
 Sure, she would.

Ma, do you mind if Bernadette
stays here this weekend?

willing to give the milk away for free...

who am I to say no?

See? She's good with it.


your sleepovers with the little brown boy...

a girl is a big relief.

All these years, I've been so wrong.

The tinier the train,
the more concentrated the fun.

You're a brain scientist.

Can you explain why a brilliant man
likes playing with toy trains?

Not without cutting his head open, no.

How about making my eyes
like Cleopatra?

Really? For a wedding?

You're right.
My cheek bones and beckoning pelvis...

already have a certain
"Hello, sailor" quality.

I'm ready.

Aw.

So handsome.

Like James Bond.

Better than James Bond
because he's tinier.

I got you this to give to me.

Oh, sweetie, guests don't normally
wear corsages to a wedding.

That's more of a prom thing.

I never went to my prom.

My mom paid my cousin to take me
but he just used the money to buy drugs.

Put the corsage on her.

Amy, this is for you, heh.

When you're done copping a feel,
that goes on my wrist.

All aboard. Woo-woo!

It's official. I'm an HO trainiac.

So dinner went nice.

Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

Does your mother always cut your meat
for you?

Only when it's fatty.

Well, don't be jealous, babe.

Someday, you'll get to cut it for me.

I found the extra head for the Water Pik...

if you wanna use it.

I'm okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.

half a brisket out of my teeth.

Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?

Oh, I know what that means. Hubba-hubba.

 Oh, God.
 Relax, it'll be fine.


Let me know when you're done canoodling.

Mommy needs a foot rub.

Do a little dance

Make a little love

Get down tonight

Do a little dance

Make a little love

Get down tonight

Would you like to dance?

No, thank you.
I'm really not much of a dancer.

You're not exactly winning any trophies
as a conversationalist, either.

I'm sorry.
The bride and groom seem happy.

Why shouldn't they be?
They have a feverish night...

of socially-approved copulation
ahead of them.

In some cultures,
we'd stand outside their room...

cheering as they achieved orgasm.

That sounds like a late night,
and I have work in the morning, so...

Leonard, you may not have noticed,
but I am being a delight here.

You're not holding up your end
of the evening.

I'm sorry.
This wedding just reminds me...

of my kind-of-sort-of girlfriend
9000 miles away.

I have a kind-of-sort-of boyfriend
playing with a model train right now.

You don't hear me bitching about it.

A word of advice.
Moody self-obsession is only attractive...

in men who can play guitar
and are considerably taller than you.

I'm not moody, I'm fun.

Do you have any evidence
to support that statement?

Well, hey,
I'm just as much fun as you are.

Really?
Are you willing to draw a mustache...

on your finger
as a conversational icebreaker?

I am.

Okay, fine. What do you suggest?

We just had a lovely meal.

The band is on fire.

And you're sitting next to a beautiful
woman wearing whorish makeup.

Why don't we head out on the floor...

and see if I can sweat
through these dress shields?

Once again,
I'm really not much of a dancer.

Don't worry, I'll lead.



Howard?


 Ready for bed?
 No. I need to brush my teeth...

but your mother's been
in the bathroom for an hour.

Oh, yeah, she sometimes
has problems doing her business.

Hang on, ahem.

Ma, give up!

Tonight's not your night!

You don't know that, I just sat down!

Come on, take a break.

Bernadette needs to brush her teeth.

and brush her teeth. I'm not embarrassed.

Problem solved.


No, it's not. I'm not going in there.

Oh, come on, honey. She's just
sitting in there reading a magazine.

You can't see anything.
I go in all the time.

Ha! The eagle has landed.


And we have splash down.


Wait here.
I'm gonna go light a candle.

And then we make passionate love.


 There we go, last floor.
 I just can't figure out what happened.

I put my left leg in,
I took my left leg out.

I put my left leg in,
and something just snapped.

The Hokey-Pokey
is a young man's game.


I did have a great time.

Thank you for reminding me
it's okay to have fun once in a while.

You're welcome.

Also for breaking the head
off the ice swan...

so I could hold it
against my pulled groin.

I excel at spatial reasoning,
and I had a hunch...

that the graceful slope of its neck
would cradle your genitals nicely.

Well, okay. Again, thank you.

And again, you're welcome.

 Wanna come in, have a cup of tea?
 No, I'm gonna head home.

Okay, well, good night.

Good night.

Ames, hi. How was the wedding?

Great. Until I accidentally made
Leonard fall in love with me.

Come in, let's talk.

Do you want a glass of wine?

Wine is one of the reasons
I'm in this fix.

That and this dang pelvis.

Okay, I'm sorry,
what exactly happened?

The inevitable. He was lonely and
vulnerable from missing his girlfriend.

While I was charming, supportive,
and let's face it...

in this dress, the perfect combination
of Madonna and whore.

 Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
 No, but it's only a matter of time.

How could I have not seen this coming?

Now I'm gonna have to break
the little sad sack's heart.

I'm sure he'll be okay.

Oh, Penny.
Much as I would treasure knowing...

the two of us had been defiled
by the same man...

Leonard just doesn't get
my motor running.

So, um, what are you gonna do?
Do you want me to talk to Leonard?

 Let him down easy.
 No. I'll let him have tonight.

I'll send him an e-mail...

letting him know this body
is never gonna be his wonderland.

I mean, frankly, you've got a better shot
than he does.

Leonard, check it out.

I bought an N gage locomotive.

Half the size of HO.

Look, it fits in my mouth.

Sounds like you had a great night.

I did.

 How was yours?
 Not bad.

I had a lot more fun with Amy
than I thought I would.

 What do you mean by that?
 It turns out she really knows...

how to help a guy loosen up
and have a good time.

Although, truth be told,
my groin's a little worse for wear.

Ow!

 Why'd you do that?
 To send a message.

She is not for you.

 What?
 Not for you.

Good morning, handsome.

Morning, Mom.

It's me.

Yes, it is.
And you're so pretty in the morning.

Your mom and I made you breakfast.

Oh, wow, heh,
so you guys are getting along?

Yeah, I guess.

We're very different people, Howard,
so communication's a little tricky.

Does he like the pancakes?

He didn't try them yet!

 Is there any butter? Heh.
 It's butter-flavored syrup.

So? What's the word?

He wants butter!

It's butter-flavored syrup!

I just told him that!

I don't need any butter.

If you want butter, I'll get you butter.

Well, I guess I'll cut these by myself.




All right, just a few more feet and...

Here we are, gentlemen,
the Gates of Elzebub.


Don't panic. This is what the last
97 hours have been about.

Stay frosty. There's a horde of goblins...

on the other side of that gate
guarding the Sword of Azeroth.

Warriors, unsheathe your weapons.
Magic wielders, raise your wands.

Lock and load.

Raj, blow the gates.

Blowing the gates.

Control-shift-B.


 Oh, my God, so many goblins.

Don't just stand there. Slash and move.

Stay in formation.

 Leonard, you got one on your tail.
 That's all right, my tail's prehensile.

I got him, Leonard.

Tonight, I spice my meat
with goblin blood.

Raj, it's a trap. They're flanking us.

Oh, he's got me.

Sheldon, he's got Raj.
Use your sleep spell.

Sheldon. Sheldon.

I've got the Sword of Azeroth.

 Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.
 There is no more Sheldon.

I am the sword master.

 Leonard, look out.
 Damn it, man, we're dying here.

Goodbye, peasants.


The bastard teleported.

He's selling the Sword of Azeroth
on eBay.

You betrayed us for money?
Who are you?

I'm a rogue knight elf.

Don't you people
read character descriptions?

Wait, wait, wait.
Somebody just clicked "Buy It Now."

I am the sword master.

Whoo! I'm all sweaty.

Wanna log on to Second Life
and go swimming?

I just built a virtual pool.

No. I can't look at you
or your avatar right now.


Sounds like your neighbor's home.

Excuse me.

Don't forget the mail you took
so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.

Oh, right, right, right.

Stealing snail mail, very old school.
I like it.

Penny, the mailman did it again. He...
Oh, sorry.

Um, no, hi, Leonard. This is Doug.

 Doug, this is my neighbor, Leonard.
 What's up, bro?

Not much.

Bro. Heh.

Is everything okay?

Yeah, no. I just...
I got your mail again, here.

Oh, thank you.
I've got to talk to that mailman.

Oh, no, that's probably
not such a good idea.

Civil servants have a documented
propensity to, you know, snap, so...

Okay. Well, thank you again.

No problem. Bye.

Oh, and bye, bro. Heh.

Penny for your thoughts.

 What's the matter?
 No, I'm fine.

Penny's fine,
the guy she's kissing is really fine.

Kissing? What kind of kissing?
Cheeks, lips, chase, French?

What is wrong with you?

I'm a romantic.

Don't tell me
that your hopeless infatuation...

is devolving into pointless jealousy.

No, I'm not jealous.
I'm just a little concerned for her.

Didn't like the look of the guy
she was with.

Because he looks better than you?

Yeah.

He was kind of dreamy.

At least now
you can retrieve the black box...

from the smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her...

and analyze the data so that
you don't crash into geek mountain again.

I disagree. Love is not a sprint.
It's a marathon.

A relentless pursuit that only ends
when she falls into your arms...

or hits you with the pepper spray.

No, I'm done with Penny.

I'm gonna be more realistic
and go after someone my own speed.

 Like who?
 I don't know.

Olivia Geiger?

The dietitian at the cafeteria
with the limp and the lazy eye?

 Yeah.
 Well, I don't think you have a shot there.

I have noticed that Leslie Winkle
recently started shaving her legs.

Now, given that winter is coming,
one can assume she's signaling...

sexual availability.

I don't know.
You guys work in the same lab.

 So?
 There are pitfalls.

Trust me, I know.

When it comes
to sexual-harassment law...

I'm a bit of a self-taught expert.

Howard, if I were to ask Leslie Winkle out,
it would just be for dinner.

I'm not gonna walk into the lab,
ask her to strip naked and dance for me.

Oh, then you're probably okay.

 Hello, Leslie.
 Hi, Leonard.

 I'd like to propose an experiment...
 Goggles.

Right.

 I would like to propose an experiment.
 Hang on.

I'm trying to see how long it takes
a 500-kilowatt oxygen-iodine laser...

to heat up my cup of noodles.

I've done it.
About two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone.


Anyway, I was thinking more
of a biosocial exploration...

with a neurochemical overlay.

Wait, are you asking me out?

I was going to characterize it
as the modification...

of our colleague/friendship paradigm
with the addition of a date-like component.

But we don't need to quibble
over terminology.

What sort of experiment
would you propose?

There is a generally accepted
pattern in this area.

I pick you up, take you to a restaurant,
then we would see a movie.

Probably a romantic comedy
featuring the talents...

of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.

Interesting.

And would you agree
the primary way we would evaluate...

the success or failure of the date would
be based on the biochemical reaction...

 ...during the good-night kiss?
 Heart rate, pheromones, et cetera, yes.

Why don't we stipulate
the date goes well...

and move to the key variable?

 You mean kiss you now?
 Yes.

 Define the parameters of the kiss.
 Closed mouth, but romantic.

 Mint?
 Thank you.


 Shall I count down from three?
 No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.

 What do you think?
 You proposed the experiment.

I think you should present
your findings first.

Fair enough.

On the plus side, it was a good kiss,
reasonable technique...

no extraneous spittle.

On the other hand, no arousal.

 None?
 None.

Ah.

Well, thank you for your time.

 Thank you.
 Hmm.

None at all?

Sheldon, if you were a robot
and I knew and you didn't...

would you want me to tell you?

That depends.

When I learn that I'm a robot,
will I be able to handle it?

Maybe, although the history
of science fiction is not on your side.

Okay. Uh, let me ask you this.

When I learn that I'm a robot...

would I be bound by
Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?

You might be bound by them right now.

That's true.

 Have you ever harmed a human being?
 Of course not.

Have you ever harmed yourself,
except in cases where a human being...

would have been endangered?

 Well, no.
 I smell robot.

 Hey, what's going on?
 Internet's been down for half an hour.

Also, Sheldon may be a robot.

So how did it go with Leslie?

Oh, we tried kissing,
but the Earth didn't move.

I mean, any more than the 383 miles
that it was gonna move anyway.

Oh, I've seen that look before.

This is just gonna be two weeks
of moping and tedious emo songs...

and calling me to come down
to pet stores to look at cats.

I don't know if I can take it.

You could power down.

Well, as usual,
Wolowitz has the solution.

I happen to know a place
where there are plenty of eligible women...

and Leonard could have his pick.


Remember the Latin hips.

Shoulders stay still and we sway.

One, two, three.

Five, six, seven.

I think Mrs. Tishman's
got her eye on you.

I've been there. You're in for a treat.

She said, "You don't know me

You don't even care"

Oh, yeah

Oh, good Lord.

She said, "You don't know me

You don't wear my chains"

Oh, yeah

God, that's a good song.

If you're compiling a mix CD
for a double suicide.

Oh, I hope that scratching post
is for you.

I know what you're thinking.
I've taken your asthma into account.

There's a feline geneticist in San Diego...

who's developed
the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos.

 Listen...
 I've been thinking about names.

I'm kind of torn between Einstein,
Newton and Sergeant Fuzzy Boots.

Do you think you can satisfy
your need for a relationship...

with a genetically altered cat?

Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat.

Oh, come on, Leonard...

This is obviously about Penny.

It doesn't matter.

The woman's not interested in me.
The woman rejected me.

Okay, look. Ahem.

You have as much of a chance of having
a sexual relationship with Penny...

as the Hubble telescope does...

of discovering
at the center of every black hole...

is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.

Nevertheless, I do feel obligated
to point out to you...

that she did not reject you.

You did not ask her out.

You're right.

I didn't ask her. I should ask her out.

No, no. Now, that was not my point.

My point was, don't buy a cat.

No, but you're right.

I should march over there
and ask her out.

Oh, goody, we're getting a cat.

Oh, yeah... No.

 Oh, hey, Leonard.
 Good afternoon, Penny.

So, hi, hey. Uh...

I was wondering
if you had plans for dinner.

Uh, you mean, dinner tonight?

There is an inherent ambiguity
in the word "dinner."

Technically,
it refers to the largest meal of the day.

So to clarify here,
by dinner, I mean supper.

 Supper?
 Or dinner, you know.

I was thinking 6:30 if you can go,
or a different time.

Uh, 6:30 is great.

Really?

 Great.
 Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.

Us guys?

Oh, you know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj.
Who all is coming?

They...

might all be there.

Or a subset of them might be there.

Algebraically speaking,
there are too many unknowns.

For example,
Sheldon had Quizno's for lunch.

Sometimes he finds that filling,
other times he doesn't.

It's no fault of Quizno's.
They have a varied menu.

Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.

Great.

 Did we say a time?
 Six-thirty.

Still good?

 It's fine.
 It's not carved in stone.

No. Six-thirty is great.

I'll get my chisel. Heh-heh.

Why?

To carve the...
Okay, I'll see you at 6:30.

How do I look?

Could you be more specific?

Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.

 What time is your date?
 Six-thirty.

Perfect, that gives you
two hours and 15 minutes...

for that dense molecular cloud
of Aramis to dissipate.

 Is it too much?
 Not if you're a rugby team.

By the way, you didn't join us
because you stuffed yourself...

with a chicken-carbonara sub
at Quizno's.

Why would I join you?

No reason.

Oh, you know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

Oh, no, well, now,
there's always the possibility...

that alcohol and poor judgment
on her part...

might lead to a nice romantic evening.

You're right. Alcohol, poor judgment.
It could go well.

Of course, there's the other possibility
that this day kicks off...

an unpleasant six months of you
passing awkwardly in the hall...

until one of you breaks down
and moves to another zip code.

You could have stopped at,
"It could go well."

If I could have, I would have.

I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy.
There's no reason...

we couldn't go to the restaurant
and have a lovely dinner.

Maybe take a walk afterwards,
talk about things we have in common.

"You love pottery? I love pottery."

You know, there's a pause.
We both know what's happening.

We kiss. It's a little tentative at first.

But I realize, she's kissing me back,
she's biting my lower lip.

She wants me.
This thing is going the distance.

We're gonna have sex.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

Is the sex starting now?

I'm having a panic attack.

Oh, okay. Well, then, calm down.

If I could,
I wouldn't be having an attack.

 That's why they call it a panic attack.
 All right.

Would you just sit down?

 Yeah, sit down. Now close your eyes.
 Why?

 Just do it.
 Okay.

Now, try to increase
your alpha-wave activity.

 What?
 It's a biofeedback technique.

It's relaxation
through brainwave manipulation.

I read it
in the Journal of American Neuroscience.

It was sparsely sourced,
but I think the science is valid.

I probably have it here somewhere.

Who am I kidding?
I can't go through with this.

 You need to call her and cancel.
 Me?

 Yes.
 What should I tell her?

 I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
 Okay.

Not the kind that would make her
wanna take care of me.

But nothing so critical that she'll feel
uncomfortable if I wanna try this again.

Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal.

I'll just tell her that you had
a routine colonoscopy...

and haven't quite bounced back.

 Give me the phone.
 I thought you wanted to cancel.

I can't. If I don't show up,
she'll still be expecting you.

Why would she be expecting me?

Stop asking me all these questions.
I need to take another shower.

 Are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
 Oh, yeah.

No.

Turns out that Raj and Howard
had to work...

and Sheldon had a colonoscopy,
and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.

Ooh, my uncle just had
a colonoscopy.

You're kidding. Well, then,
that's something we have in common.

How?

We both have people in our lives
who wanna nip intestinal polyps in the bud.

So, what's new in the world of physics?

Nothing.

Really? Nothing?

Well, with the exception of string theory,
not much has happened since the 1930s...

and you can't prove string theory.

At best you can say, "Hey, look, my idea
has an internal logical consistency."

Ah. Well, I'm sure things will pick up.

What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?

Oh, uh, not much.

Oh, we do have a chocolate key lime
that's moving pretty well.

Good.

Uh, what about
your, uh, hallway friend?

Doug? Oh, yeah. I don't know. I mean,
you know, he's nice and funny, but...

 Can I get you started with some drinks?
 No. Bzzz.

 You were saying, "But..."?
 I'd like a drink.

Just say the "but" thing about Doug,
and then I'll get her back.

Okay, well, it...
I don't know. It's just me.

I'm still getting over this break-up
with Kurt.

And this thing with Doug
would just be rebound sex.

Ugh. Don't get me started
on rebound sex.

It's just... It's my pattern.

I break up, then I find some cute guy...

and then it's just
36 meaningless hours of...

Well, you know.

I'm not sure that I do. Um...

Is that one 36-hour experience
or is that 36 hours spread out over...

say, one glorious summer?

No. It's usually over a weekend.

And trust me,
you do not feel good after it.

Well, chafing, right?

Emotionally.

Of course, yeah. Emotional chafing.

Hey, do you wanna see something cool?

I can make this olive go into this glass
without touching it.

 How?
 Physics.

Wow, centrifugal force.

Actually, it's centripetal force,
which is an inward force...

generated by the glass
acting on the olive. Ooh.

Excuse me.

Now, if you were biting on the olive...

you'd be in a non-inertial
reference frame and would...

 Are you okay?
 Yeah, I'm okay.

Did you spill ketchup?

 No.
 I'm not okay.

You don't wanna go
to the emergency room?

No, no. I'm okay.

It stopped bleeding.

Anyway, you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

Yes, but I get carsick too, so...

Okay.

Sorry about your car, by the way.

Oh, no, it's fine.
You got most of it out the window.

The poor guy on the bike.

I had a nice time.

Yeah, me too.

Well, um, good night.

Good night.

 Leonard.
 Yeah?

Was this supposed to be a date?

This?

No.

No, of course not.

This was just you and me hanging out
with guys who didn't show up...

because of work and a colonoscopy.

Okay. I was just checking.

When I take a girl on a date...
And I do, heh.

she knows she's been dated.

Capital D. Heh.

Bold face, underlined, like, dated.

I think I might have a concussion.
I'm gonna go lay down.

Good night.

 So how was your date?
 Awesome. Heh.

Score one for liquor and poor judgment.



All right, Raj has played
his Phantom Warlord card...

and I am going to back him up
with my Strangling Vines.

Choke on that, sucker.

Okay. Well, then I'll just cut your vines
with my Ruby Sword.

That's right, I did it. I cut them.

Um...

I have a question.

Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf,
elf beats water sprite...

and basically everything beats
Enchanted Bunny.

Unless you have the Carrot of Power.

Okay, I've got another question.

When does this get fun?

Are we gonna talk or are we gonna play
Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?

Just play a potion card.

Which one?

It doesn't matter,
you can't possibly win.

 Don't ruin the game.
 How could he ruin the game?

Given the cards already played, Penny can
only be holding Necromancer Potions...

which are only effective against
wraiths and daywalkers...

and there are no more left.
The cards remaining in the stack are:

Four fire weapons, a troll,
two ogres and the Jewel of Osiris.

See? Ruined.

Sheldon, that is incredible.

From your vantage point,
it certainly must seem so.

Sheldon has kind of
a photographic memory.

"Photographic" is a misnomer.

I have an eidetic memory,
as I've told you many times.

Most recently last year during lunch
on the afternoon of May 7th.

You had turkey
and complained it was dry.

Well, I guess game's over.

Really? Oh, great.

I mean, aww...

 Okay, I gotta go.
 Why?

Because last time I didn't go,
I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.

Not "Ka." Ka-ah.

 Bye.
 See you.

Still can't believe
she's going out with me.

Nobody can.

That reminds me,
I have a bone to pick with you.

 What?
 You and I made a pact...

that if either of us
ever got a hot girlfriend...

that person
would have his girlfriend...

hook the other guy up
with one of her girlfriends.

 Yeah, I don't remember that.
 Wha...?

June 30th, 2004.

Opening day of Spider-Man 2
at the AMC Pasadena.

They only had red ICEES, no blue.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, you've been with Penny
for like a month and a half.

Where's my shorty, Morty?

Howard, you can't hold me to that.

 Why not?
 When I made that agreement...

I didn't think I'd ever have a girlfriend,
and I was positive you never would.

 How come I wasn't part of this deal?
 You had left the refreshment stand...

in order to indulge in your customary
preemptive pre-show urination.

So that's how it works? I have a teeny
bladder and I don't get a hot girlfriend?

Yeah, Raj, that's how it works.

Damn.

Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?

I'm sorry, no.

But you have a whole bunch of them.

Yes, I've moved
to a four-napkin system.

Lap, hands, face
and personal emergency.

If you like, starting tomorrow
I'll add a guest napkin...

but I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do for you today.

Good luck. That's the face napkin.

 So have you talked to Penny yet?
 No, I haven't.

 Why not?
 Because I've been busy.

Because I haven't figured out a way
to bring it up.

And mostly,
and I can't stress how key this is...

because I don't want to.

A pact is a pact.
You have to get Penny to fix me up.

It's not that simple.
What am I supposed to say?

"Penny, you have any friends
you'd like to never hear from again?"

Come on. I'm smart, I have a good job.
And I have only 3 percent body fat.

It's true. I've seen him at the beach.
He's like a human chicken wing.

Leonard, come on.

 Fine, I'll ask if she has a friend for you.
 A hot friend.

 Right.
 And tall.

I want our kids to be able to ride
Space Mountain before they're 20.

I'll see what I can do.

Hey, guess what I heard today.

I'd imagine you heard
any number of things today.

When you arrived at work,
you undoubtedly heard:

"Hello. How are you, Raj?"

You're wearing a new sweater vest,
you may have heard:

"New sweater vest?" And possibly,
though less likely, "Nice sweater vest."

Why don't I just tell you
what I heard today?

That would probably save us
some time.

Saturday night
at the comic-book store...

they're having a Mystic Warlords
of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is $500.

 If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.
 I'm sorry, Raj.

I have no interest in playing a game
in which I find no challenge.

 But what about the money?
 I have money.

But this is other money.

How does it differ
from the money I have?

Half of it will be mine.

Do you need it
to buy a less disturbing sweater vest?

 Leonard, help.
 Are you kidding?

I couldn't even talk him into giving me
one of his freaking napkins.

Wow, you really are a genius.

Not really. I Googled how to do that.

So listen...

Have you ever made a pact
with someone?

You mean like a pinky swear?

Okay, fine. Like a pinky swear.

In the first grade, my friend Rosie and I
made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie.

 You know, from Sesame Street.
 I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.

Then we found out
we both wanted Ernie.

We didn't speak again
till middle school.

Over puppets?

The heart wants what the heart wants,
Leonard.

Okay.

Speaking of what the heart wants, um...

a long time ago I made a pact
with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.

Okay, I don't know
where you're going with this...

but tread carefully because it may be
the last conversation we ever have.

No, no, nothing like that.

No, the deal was that
if either of us ever got a girlfriend...

we'd have her fix the other one up
with one of her friends.

You thought a good time to bring this up
would be right after sex?

Well, I sure as hell wasn't gonna
bring it up before sex.

And during I was trying to remember
what I read on Google, so...

I'm not hooking Wolowitz up
with my friends.

Come on,
it doesn't have to be a good friend.

And you know that deep down inside,
Howard's a really nice guy.

The problem isn't what's on the inside.
It's the creepy candy coating.

Will you at least think about it?

Just as a favor to me?

The great thing about Ernie
was he never asked me for anything.

He just gave.

Got it. Got it. Got it.

Betty and Veronica. Oh.

Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern
figurine's coming in tomorrow.

 Want me to set one aside for you?
 Thank you.

You just robbed me of the opportunity
to stumble upon the figurine...

and make the oh-so-satisfying journey
from discovery to desire to possession.

 All right, I won't.
 But I must have it.

 Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
 Thank you.

I can buy all these things online.
I come here for the personal service.

Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up
for the Mystic Warlords Tournament...

the Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?

Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.

Excuse me,
are you saying that Wil Wheaton...

a.k.a. Ensign Wesley Crusher
on Star Trek: The Next Generation...

is participating in your tournament?

I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity
to stumble onto that for yourself?

No, wait, you don't understand.
Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton.

You know, Wesley Crusher
had an eidetic memory just like me.

Oh, what a coincidence.
You can discuss that with him...

while playing in the tournament.
Sign here.

Yeah, I was such a fan that in 1995
I traveled 10 hours by bus...

to a sci-fi convention
in Jackson, Mississippi...

wearing my Starfleet Academy
cadet uniform...

in order to meet Wil Wheaton
and get him to autograph...

my mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.

Oh, it'll be like a reunion then.
Sign here.

Yeah, my arduous journey, however,
was for naught.

Although advertised to appear,
he did not show up.

It was at that moment
I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.

Okay, great,
you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.

It might interest you to know
that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth...

on my all-time enemies list, right
between director Joel Schumacher...

who nearly destroyed
the Batman movie franchise...

and Billy Sparks,
who lived down the street from me...

and put dog poop
on the handles of my bicycle.

Okay, I get it. He's a bad guy.
Sign here.

In the words of Khan Noonien Singh
in the immortal Wrath of Khan:

"He tasks me.
He tasks me and I shall have him."

 No doubt. Sign here.
 "From hell's heart, I stab at thee."

All right, Raj.
Looks like you're teamed up with...

"Die, Wil Wheaton, die."

So tell me more
about the future mother of my children.

She's adorable, Howard.
I think you'll like her.

Great.

What did you tell her about me?
Did you mention body fat?

No, I thought
that'd be a nice surprise for her.

Good, good.

I told her you're an aerospace engineer,
you speak five languages...

Six, if you count Klingon.

Girls don't count Klingon, Howard.

 Right?
 Right.

And I told her you have
an unhealthy attachment to your mother.

 What?
 I'm kidding.

Another delightful surprise for her.

Sheldon, it's your play.

Sheldon.

My Enchanted Troll bludgeons
your Screaming Harpy...

with a Cursed Mace. Game.

Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother
when she picks you up.

Or I could just tell her later tonight.
Ha-ha-ha.

We pawned them, dude. Up top.

Look at him.

Wil Wheaton, my old friend.

I have chased you
around the moons of Nibia...

and around the Antares Maelstrom,
and around Perdition's flames.

You keep quoting Wrath of Khan,
but he was in Next Generation.

 It's a totally different set of characters.
 Silence.

How much longer must I wait
for my revenge?

If Wil Wheaton
and Stuart win their match...

and we beat Lonely Larry and
Captain Sweatpants in the next round...

we'll face off for championship.

So my path to satisfaction is blocked
by Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants.

Very well, they must be destroyed.

Dude, you have to stop talking like that.
It's really lame.

Silence.

So Penny tells me
you're working as a waitress...

to put yourself through grad school.
That's great.

 What are you studying?
 Microbiology.

Oh, cool. So you could study me.

I don't understand.

Microbiology is the study
of tiny living things.

I know, I'm studying it.

Yeah, and I said you could study me
because I'm a tiny living thing.

 It's a joke.
 Are you sure?

 Do you like science fiction?
 No.

 Role-playing games?
 Like in the bedroom...

or like Dungeons and Dragons?

 Either.
 No.

 You like...?
 It's gonna be a long night.

 Yeah, well, it's your fault.
 I had to ask, you didn't have to say yes.

You like magic?

 Not really.
 Okay.

Long, long night.

I play my Endless Serpent,
Raj will play Ecstatic Frenzy...

which means Larry
will have to play Chaos Overlord.

Then Captain Sweatpants,
Molten River.

I play Nightshade Dryad.
Game, set and match.

Now fetch me Wil Wheaton.

Did that guy just say, "Revenge is a dish
best served cold," in Klingon?

I believe so.

What is wrong with him?

Everyone has a different theory.

How about computers?
You like computers?

I use them. I don't like them.

Okay. Puppies.
Where do you stand on puppies?

A puppy once bit my face.

Of course it did.

 How about that? Einstein was wrong.
 What?

Approaching the speed of light doesn't
slow down time, approaching them does.

Excuse me.

Oh, damn. It's my mother.

 Are you going to answer it?
 I'm torn.

She might be dying and, you know,
wouldn't want to miss that.

On other hand, if let it go to voicemail,
I could play it over and over.

I know how you feel.
My mother makes me crazy.

Yeah, not as crazy
as my mother makes me.

Yeah? Does your mother call you
every day at work...

to see if you've had a healthy lunch?

My mother calls me at work to see
if I had a healthy bowel movement.

Okay, does she lay out your clothes
for you in the morning...

like you're 9 years old?

 You live with your mother?
 No. That's the sad part.

Rough. Okay, check this out.

My mother made me wear rubber gloves
to kindergarten...

so I wouldn't pick up a disease
from the other children.

That's nothing.
I couldn't ride a bicycle...

because my mother was afraid
I'd hit a bump and lose my virginity.

Oh, wow, you didn't, did you?

Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.

A Corolla.

 More wine?
 I'd love some.

Listen, you have to come
to Shabbat dinner at my house sometime.

Why?

A Catholic girl like you
wearing a big cross like that...

might just give my mother the big
brain aneurysm I've been hoping for.

Okay, but only if you come to Sunday
dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.

It's a date.

Am I a matchmaker or what?

Lava Serpent.

Nest of Snakes.

 Underworld Guardian.
 Underworld Guardian.

We skirmish to the death.

 Invisibility Spell.
 Luminescence Spell.

 Water nymph.
 Fire demon.

 Two-headed tiger.
 Three-headed lion.

 Sulfur.
 Brimstone.

Problem, Wil Wheaton?

Hang on.

You're holding two moderate spell cards,
a Small Rock and a Potion of Zancor...

which will be as much help as an
air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth.

Your only move is to play the potion,
lose the skirmish...

and two moves later, the game.

 I think he's got me.
 The year was 1995.

The place, Jackson, Mississippi.

Having spent 10 hours on a bus...

during which I had
to twice violate my personal rule...

against relieving myself
onboard a moving vehicle...

I finally arrived at the
Fourth Annual Dixie Trek Convention...

only to find that my idol,
Wil Wheaton...

decided he had better things to do
than show up and sign my action figure.

What?

You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton.

Now I have my revenge.

You went to the '95 Dixie Trek?

Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died,
and I had to go to her funeral.

Your memaw died?

That's terrible.

Yeah. It was.

But I'm really sorry
that I disappointed you.

No, no, I understand.

If anything happened to my memaw,
I'd be one inconsolable Moon Pie.

I should clarify that statement
by explaining that she calls me Moon Pie.

It's a special relationship, isn't it?
Between a boy and his grandmother.

 Oh, yes.
 Yeah, okay.

Okay, great,
everybody loves their grandmas.

Now, come on, Sheldon,
finish him off.

Yeah. It's okay, Sheldon.
I let you down.

I deserve it.

Potion of Zancor.

What are you waiting for?

Kill Wil Wheaton.
From hell's heart, stab at him.

 I can't.
 Sure you can. Do it. Do it.

No.

I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton,
the man who destroyed my dreams.

But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton,
the man who loved his memaw.

 Enchanted Bunny.
 No!

Not Enchanted Bunny!

I call my memaw "nana."

And she's gonna be very happy
to hear...

that my Small Rock
kills your Enchanted Bunny.

Game over, Moon Pie.

I don't understand.
Your grandmother's alive?

Oh, you catch on quick.

Come on, Stewie,
let's get our prize money.

That was fun.

Wheaton!

Wheaton!



Okay, help me out here.

How does an archeology professor
get that good with a whip?

Maybe he took a class
at the adult bookstore.

That's how I learned.

I can't believe you've never
seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.

And I can't believe you've
never read Eat, Pray, Love.

When she comes out with

Eat, Pray, Run Away From A
Giant Boulder, I'll read it.

I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love
changed your life,

I'm not reading it.

You know, I could totally
rock a hat like that.

That's the work of noted
Hollywood costume designer

Deborah Nadoolman.

She also designed

the iconic red and black jacket

in Michael Jackson's
Thriller video,

which I've never viewed
in its entirety,

as I find zombies dancing

in choreographed synchronicity
implausible.

And also, it's really scary.

Would someone please turn off
the Sheldon commentary track?

There's no switch.
Just listen and learn.

Penny, if you think
this is good,

you should come with us Friday

to see it on the big screen
at the Colonial.

Well, I'm watching it now.

Why would I want to see it again
on Friday?

Because the print
they're showing on Friday

has an additional 21 seconds
of previously unseen footage.

21 seconds? That'll be like
seeing a whole new movie!

Exactly.

They say it finally solves
the submarine controversy.

Did-- Leonard?

I'm no expert, but I believe

what we just heard from Penny
was sarcasm.

Oh! Good.

I'm eight for 26 this month.

Yeah, I think I'll pass.

But you guys enjoy
your extra 21 seconds.

Bet if I could
make you understand

why this is such a cool thing,
we'd still be together.

Mm, yeah, no,
we wouldn't.

Uh-huh.

I'm guessing 21 seconds had
something to do with that, too.

 


May I point out to you all

that the screening is
"first come, first served"?

Relax, it's 5:00. The movie
doesn't start till midnight.

Another way of saying that is

"the movie starts at midnight,
and it's already 5:00."

Let's go.

You know, if we miss it,
we'll have the fun of

listening to Sheldon whine about
it for the rest of our lives.

See? Howard's on my side.

Actually, I'm not.

I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

Drat. Now I'm 8 for 27.

Don't worry, Sheldon.
We'll be fine.

What happened to
the Leonard Hofstadter

who waited in line
with me for 14 hours

to see the midnight premiere
of Star Trek: Nemesis?

Oh. Well, he waited
in line for 14 hours,

while you napped
in a lawn chair,

he got in a fight
with a Klingon

when he stepped
out of line to pee

and you wouldn't wake up
to vouch for him,

and worst of all,
he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.

But how were our seats?

Excellent.

I rest my case.

Amy, don't you agree we should
leave now and get in line?

Actually, as the newest member
of your social group,

I believe I'll gain more
acceptance by arbitrarily

siding with your friends
from time to time.

Shrewd.

Leonard, you're right.

We should enjoy our meal,
arrive late,

and risk winding up
with terrible seats,

assuming we get in at all.

Thank you, Amy.

See? It's working.

Knock-knock.

Who's there?

Olive.

Olive you, too.

Guys, that's really
starting to get old.

Knock-knock.

Who's there?

I have a girlfriend
and you don't.

Hysterical!

Wait, now, we don't know
that yet. He isn't finished.

I have a girlfriend
and you don't who?

So. Are you sure you don't want
to come with us to Raiders?

Oh, no. That movie
has melting faces.

It reminds me
too much of the time

I dropped that vial of
flesh-eating bacteria

into the Rhesus monkey lab.

Besides, Penny and I are having
a girls' night tonight.

Girls' night?
What does that entail?

Oh, you know, girls get
together,

hang out, share girl talk.

I'm a girl.

Oh. Well, maybe you can join us.
I'll ask Penny.

No need. Penny and I
are very close.

You are?

Yes. In fact,
our menses are synchronized.

Penny.

Bernadette tells me you're
planning a girls' night.

Yeah?

I'm a girl.

Oh. Um, it was-- it was just
going to be me and Bernadette.

Besides, I thought you
were going to the movies

with Sheldon and the guys.

Yes, but they're not girls.

I'm a girl.

Yeah, no, no,
I-I-I got that.

What's the dress code?

Uh, just wear something
comfortable.

All right.
I'll have to go shopping.

Knock-knock.

Who is there?

Hugh.
Hugh who?

Hugh people need to
listen to me.

It's time to get
in line for the movie.

And that's how you tell
a knock-knock joke.

Under normal circumstances
I'd say, "I told you so."

But as I have told you so

with such vehemence
and frequency already,

the phrase has lost all meaning.

Therefore, I will be
replacing it with the phrase:

"I informed you thusly."

Ooh. Can't wait
for that to start.

I informed you thusly.

Eight for 28.

This is where we could have been
if we hadn't stopped for dinner.

This is where we could have been

if Koothrappali
hadn't ordered dessert.

Well I earned it, dude,
I ate all my broccoli.

And here's where we are.
The runts in a large litter.

unlikely to ever reach

the nourishing teats
of Indiana Jones.

So I guess it's a good thing
we stopped for dinner.

You know, guys, when
facing disappointment,

Eat, Pray, Love  teaches us--

Oh, shut up.

so anyway, to make
a long story short,

turns out I have
an unusually firm cervix.

You--
Amy, when we say "girl talk,"

it doesn't just have to
be about our lady parts.

Shame. 'Cause I have a real
zinger about my titled uterus.

Penny, your nails
look great.

Oh, thanks. I found
this place in Alhambra.

It's in a woman's basement.

I think it's a front
for human trafficking,

but they do a really good job.

A colleague of mine did her
graduate thesis on the fungus

that grows on improperly
sterilized manicure implements.

Well don't tell me
that's not "girl talk."

So where should
we go tonight?

A bar? A club? A movie?

Or we could just stay here.

Yes, and continue to bond.

I have a feeling
that after tonight,

one of you will become
my best friend forever.

Or "BFF," if you prefer.

Which I don't.

All right, time to open
Bachelor Number Two.

Gee, I don't know
if I should drink more.

I have to drive home,
and I've got enough trouble

seeing over the dashboard
as it is.

That's okay.
You can just sleep here.

Oh, good, a slumber party!

We'll do makeovers,
initiate phony phone calls,

and have spirited pillow fights
in our frilly nighties!

Oh, gosh, Amy.

I don't know if I would call
this an actual slumber party.

Well, that's disappointing.

I've always wanted to be
invited to a slumber party.

Oh, you never were?

Not even when
you were a kid?

Well, there was the time
I had my tonsils out,

and I shared a room with
a little Vietnamese girl.

She didn't make it
through the night,

but up till then,
it was kind of fun.

Okay. Well, I guess we're
having a slumber party.

Oh!

Pillow fight!

Oh, I hope they
let us in soon.

I'm tired of running to the gas
station to use the bathroom.

The guy makes me buy
a Gatorade every time.

It's a vicious circle.

Too bad you don't have
a stadium pal like me.

What's a stadium pal?

Let me put it this way:

takes care of
the bathroom problem,

and it keeps your calf warm.

Hey, guys, bad news.
I just did a quick calculation.

Given the size of the theater
and the length of this line,

we might not get seats.

What did he say?

Nice going, Raj.

Just got him down for his nap.

We might not get seats?!

It's fine, it's fine.
Go back to sleep.

Oh, I informed you thusly!
I so informed you thusly.

Howard, you talk to him.

Howard?

You're peeing,
aren't you?

Hey, look who's here!

Hey, buddies!

Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton,

the Jar Jar Binks
of the Star Trek universe.

Mee-sa think that very funny!

Well, you-sa can go think that
at the back of the line.

No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.

Wil Wheaton.

Yeah.

I'm a big fan.

Of what? Poorly
executed beards?

Do you think you could get me
and my friends into the movie?

We got here
a little late.

No problem. Come on,
I'll hook you up.

Awesome.

We-sa gonna go into
the movie now! Bye-bye!

This is Indiana Jones,
not Star Trek.

There should be no value
to his pseudo-celebrity here!

And even at
Star Trek conventions,

they only let him in
if he helps set up!

Calm down, Sheldon.

I will not calm down.

This affront to justice and
decency cannot go unanswered.

As Captain Jean-Luc Picard
once said,

"The line must be drawn here!

"This far, no farther!"

Had to wake him up
from his nap, didn't you?

You know what I really love
about Howard?

His chest hair.

Howard has a
hairy chest?

No, just the one.

But it's really long.

Okay, there you go--
Sultry Sunrise Red.

What do you think?

My nails have never
looked so pretty before.

Get it off.

Oh, oh, uh, looks like
they're getting ready

to let people in.

Listen to what Mr. Wil
Wheaton is tweeting.

"Best seats in house
for Raiders screening.

Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."

Why do you read
his Twitter feed?

You know it's only
going to upset you.

I believe in knowing
my enemy, Leonard.

Had Twitter existed at the time,
would not General Custer

have followed the tweets
of Sitting Bull?

Would not Lee have
followed Grant?

Would not Spy have followed Spy?

I have more examples,
but excuse me.

Hello.

Well, this seems
like an odd time

to test my cell phone quality,
but go on.

Test phrases? All right.

Imatote.

Ulba.

Twad.

All together?

I'm a total buttwad.

Why are you laughing?

Hello?

And that, girls, is how you make
a phony phone call.

I'm not sure I grasp

the full entertainment value,
but all right.

Next on Wikipedia's list
of slumber party activities:

"Truth or Dare."

Okay, it's your game.
You go first.

Hang on. I'm familiarizing
myself with the rules.

Seems fairly straightforward.

Bernadette, truth or dare?

Truth.
All right.

To what temperature
must you heat beef

in order to
kill the prion

that causes bovine
spongiform encephalopathy?

Um...

Remember, you have
to answer honestly.

Wait. No, Amy, you're
supposed to ask her

something personal
or embarrassing.

Oh.

All right.

What is the circumference
of your areolas?

"Munching on
complimentary popcorn.

Woot, woot."

Oh, the gall.

I hope his next tweet is
"Popcorn lodged in trachea.

"Choking to death.

Woot, woot."

Guys, I am sorry.
We are full up.

No!

We're full up.

We really want
to see this.

Isn't there anything
you can do?

Sorry. Fire regulations.
Should've gotten here earlier.

This is nothing but a
blatant abuse of power

by a petty functionary.

Explain to me why
Wil Wheaton and his lackeys

get in and we don't.

'Cause I'm the petty functionary
with a clipboard, bitch.

I guess that's that.

Let's go home.

You know what?

I'm going back to
"I told you so."

I told you so.

We can still see something.

Oh, the new Sandra Bullock movie
is playing two blocks away.

You know Sandy B.
always brings it.

Look-- a side door.

Come on, Short Round.

I guess we'd better
go after him.

Short Round?

Indy's young sidekick
from Temple of Doom.

Yeah, I know who it
is, but why is it me?

You're right. It should
be a cuddly Asian boy.

Like me.

"And Absolon hath
kist hir nether ye,

"and Nicholas is scalded
in the towte.

This tale is doon,
and God save al the rowte."

What the hell was that?

Bernadette dared me to
tell a dirty story.

"The Miller's Tale" by Chaucer
is the dirtiest story I know.

It would have been hidden
in sock drawers

if people in the 14th century
had worn socks.

I thought it was pretty spicy.

Especially the part
where he kisses her nether ye.

You might not
like it as much

if you knew what
"nether ye" meant.

if one cares
about hygiene,

one ought not be kissing it.

Okay, my turn.

Penny, truth or dare?

Truth.

Why are you still hanging out
with Leonard so much

even though you broke up
with him?

Oh, that's an
excellent question.

For two people who claim to be
no longer pair-bonded,

you spend an inordinate amount
of time in each other's company.

Yeah.

Dare.

I don't believe the rules allow

for an ex post facto
option change.

Yeah.

Okay, look, just because we're
not seeing each other anymore

doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

I mean, Leonard's a great guy.

Then, why did you terminate
your relationship with him?

I don't know.

He got really serious,
and I wasn't ready for it.

Interesting.

How will you react
if, in the future,

you become ready for it,
and Leonard is unavailable,

because another woman
has realized that he is--

to use your words--
"a great guy"?

You can only ask one question.

That one.

You know what,
I don't want to play anymore.

Well, I'm not sure
how this is scored,

but I believe
we may have won.

Sheldon?

Sheldon?

Where did he go?

We're looking for Sheldon,
not Marmaduke.

You whistled?

What is that?

Raiders of the Lost Ark

with 21 additional seconds.

If I can't see it,
no one else can see it.

Sheldon, this is crazy.

No. Crazy was leaving
the projection booth unattended.

Listen to me.

You are over-tired.
You're not thinking right.

Put the movie back
before we get into trouble.

Trouble is my middle name,
Leonard.

Actually, it's Lee,
but I prefer Trouble.

Oh, look who
they let in.

Don't worry, Wil Wheaton.
I was just leaving.

Come on, Short Round.

Yeah.

Come on, guys!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

Let's see you run

with a bag of urine
strapped to your leg.

He's got the movie! Get him!

Why is there never a pontoon
plane when you need one?

She's been in there
a long time.

Clearly, losing Truth or Dare
upset her.

Perhaps we should try
to take her mind off it

with another popular
slumber party activity.

Ooh, like what?
Well, the Internet suggests

that slumber party guests
often engage

in harmless experimentation
with lesbianism.

Where exactly on the Internet
have you been looking?

Penny?
Oh, hey, Amy.

Look, I'm sorry I got
so upset. I just...

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

What are you doing?

Don't worry. I'll
avoid the nether ye.

I might have gone
with eating raw cookie dough.



Morning.

Morning.

 Sleep okay?
 Um uh.  Great!

Hey, can I ask you something?

Sure.

Last night, me wanting to try
that stuff out of the Kama Sutra.

Was that fun for you
or kinda racially insensitive?

Yes. Just because you're in bed
with an India woman

you think that gives you permission

to use crazy positions
from an ancient Indian love manual.

Hey, if you can find a book
called "Weird Sex with White Boys"

I'd be okay with that.

No, no, you know you have such
beautiful eyes.

Have you ever thought about
getting contacts?

I tried in the seventh grade.
I could never get used to them.

Oh. That's too bad.

Yeah. If I had contacts,
I would have been the coolest

Debate Club president ever to be
stuffed into his own cello case.

If you had them on now, you could
see what we're going to do next.

That-That's okay.
I can infer from context.

Hey, Raj, you wanna see a new
magic trick I been working on?

Eh, Howard.

If I may interject here
with a piece of friendly advice.

Is working on magic tricks, really
how you want to spend your time?

Uh, granted,
you're just an engineer, but...

That doesn't mean you might
not someday build a geegaw

or a thingamabob that

that may get you a "thank you" in someone
else's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

Is the trick making him disappear?

Sure, let's see it.

Here.
Shuffle these.

Okay.

Now spread them out on the table.
Face down.

Pick one.
Look at it.

Okay.

Now remember your card.
Put it back in the deck.

Is it any wonder
he doesn't have a doctorate?

Now remind me,
what's your birthday?

October sixth.

Okay, October is the tenth month.

So 10-- one plus zero
is one plus six is seven.

Turn over the seventh card.

How about that!

But, is that your card?

Yes. It is.
Very cool!

Oh it's not cool.

It's a childish trick, designed
to confuse and intrigue simpletons.

How'd you do it?

A magician never reveals his secrets.

But surely a future
Nobel Prize winner can figure it out.

Fine.

Give me a second.

You ever notice when he thinks
real hard it smells like bacon?

 Oh hey!
 Sorry! Oop!

Check it out.
I just got contacts.

 


One, two,

three, four, five.

No way.

That's your card, right?

Seven of clubs!

That is amazing!

It's not amazing.

All magic tricks are merely
a combination

of manipulation
and misdirection

with the occasional dwarf in
a box wiggling his feet.

Oh, really?
So how did I do it?

I don't care how you did it.

I have more important things
to think about.

Clearly, the cards
are marked.

I thought you had more important
things to think about.

I do.
You just happened

to have caught me
on a break.

Oh, let me see
those cards.

Big deal. Not knowing

is part of the fun.

"Not knowing is part
of the fun."

Was that the motto
of your community college?

Hey, guys,
what do you think?

Priya took me
clothes shopping.

Hey, you look great.

Good for you, Priya.

I could never get that stupid
hoodie off him

when we were...

Well, you look great.

Thank you.

Lets go hang
everything up.

Yeah, good.

New contacts.

I should have done this
years ago.

So you finally getting used to
them doing it on a daily basis?

I'm not going out with him.

He can sleep
with whoever he wants.

Yeah, I was talking to Raj.

Oopsy.

This deck is rigged in
some fashion.

Fine. Get another deck

and I'll do
the trick with that.

So you're saying this is
a regulation deck?

I'm saying believe in magic,
you muggle.

You know, well, I'm happy
Leonard's found someone.

Not that anybody asked.

How many Star Trek uniforms
do you have?

Just two:

everyday and dress.

Uh-huh.

Listen, we need
to talk about something.

Oh, my God, you're breaking up
with me!

Why would you take me out
shopping

and then break up with me?
That is so cruel!

Leonard, I'm not breaking up
with you.

Oh, okay.

So, what's up?

It's a little weird,

your ex-girlfriend hanging out
here all the time.

I know.

I usually never see
my ex-girlfriends,

unless their hard drives crash.

I'm just saying, how would you
feel if I was hanging out

with my ex-boyfriend?

Um, not great, I guess.

But Penny and I are
just friends.

I don't care.

This is a woman you have
slept with.

If you want her around,

then I have to wonder if maybe
you're not ready to move on.

No, no-no-no, I'm ready!

I gave up the gift of
sight for you.

If that's not moving on,
what is?

You need to cut the cord
with Penny.

Oh... okay.

You don't sound very confident.

No, no, I'm confident.

Its not like I'm unfamiliar with
the "get lost" conversation.

Although, this will be the first
time I'll be the one saying it.

Thank you.

I appreciate it.

Sure.

Oh, God, you
smell so good.

Of course, that
could just be

my other senses
getting stronger.

Hypothetically, if I had access

to a Lieutenant Uhura uniform,
would you wear it?

Leonard, it is a source
of great pain

to me and my family

that my brother has that outfit
in his wardrobe.

Can we not discuss it?

I'm sorry. Never mind.

And was your card the jack
of diamonds?

Oh, unbelievable!

Know how he did it yet?

Um...

Aw, he has the same look
my little nephew gets

when he can't figure out
how I got his nose.

You know, I have some remedial
magic tricks

that might be more your speed.

Like, ooh, look!

The pencil's rubber!

Hey, I think I know how you did
the card trick.

Oh, please, if I don't know,
you don't know.

That's axiomatic.

Come here.

You're right.

Not too bad for someone

who doesn't know
what "axiomatic" means.

Oh, hi.

Hey, you.

What happened with
the contacts?

One of them's upstairs.

The other one sort of slipped
back into my skull.

Hey, is that one of the new
shirts Priya got you?

Yeah.

You don't wanna
wash that.

No?
No, that's silk.

Seriously, what would you do
without me?

Yeah.

You know, I gotta
tell you, I think

you got a real winner
with Priya.
Yeah, me, too.

She seems really sweet.

Believe me, you do not want
to take that for granted.

There are a lot of bitches
out there.

Yeah, bitches are the worst.

All right, I'll
see you later.

Uh, Penny, there's something
I have to tell you.

What?

Okay, uh, how do I put this?

Um... are you familiar with
Darwin's observation

of the finches
in the Galapagos Islands?

Did they make a movie about it?

No.

Then no.

All right, well, anyway, Darwin
observed that when two groups

of finches competed
over the same food source,

eventually one of them would
evolve a different beak shape

so they could feed on
something else.

Okay.

So what do you think we can
learn from that behavior

that we can apply
to our own lives?

Uh, a bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush?

Sure, that has birds in it.

It's fun talking to you,
Leonard; I always learn stuff.

I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna count that.

Do you really have
to wear that in bed?

Yeah. The doctor didn't want me
to rub my eye during the night.

It was either this or one
of those giant neck cones.

So did you get
to talk to Penny?

Oh, yes.
Indeed, I did.

And?

She completely understood
everything I said. Case closed.

Was she upset?

Maybe, but that's
not my problem.

She's not my girlfriend,
you are.

I hope you weren't
cruel to her.

Is the autumn cruel
for letting the flowers die,

or is that just nature's way?

Leonard?
Leonard?

Leonard?

What?!

I think I figured out
Wolowitz's magic trick,

and I need you
to pick a card.

I am not opening
that door, Sheldon!

As you wish.

Pick a card, put it back,
and prepare to be amazed.

Did you pick one?

Yep.

Is this your card?

Nope.

Drat.

Is this your card?

No.

I'll be right back.

Pick a card, Sheldon.

Now look at it,
and put it back in the deck.

Now do you remember your card?

Of course I do, I have
an eidetic memory.

My apologies.

Now shuffle the cards.

Shuffling.

Wait here.

Processing image,
cross-referencing...

Whatcha doin'?

I'm reverse engineering
Wolowitz's magic trick.

What's up
with the infrared cameras?

I'm measuring residual heat
levels on the playing cards

to determine
which one's been touched.

By the way,

if you hope to have children,

I suggest you switch
from briefs to boxers.

Your testicles look a tad warm.

Holy crap,
are you connected

to the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory?

Yes. I'm using their
Cray supercomputer

to analyze
shuffling patterns.

Sheldon, that computer
is used

for national defense.

Hacking into it is
a federal crime.

Relax, we're not under
attack right now.

Okay, I'm leaving before the
black helicopters get here.

And is this my card?

Rats!

I wonder if Howard used
a radioactive tracer.

Where am I going to find
uranium-235 this time of night?

Come on, CraigsList.

Is it racist that I took you
to an Indian restaurant?

It's okay, I like Indian food.

Or as you probably call it
back home, "food."

Why didn't you wear
your contacts?

Don't you like them?

No, no, I do.

It's just I knew I was having
curry tonight

and I only want one part
of my body to burn at a time.

You know...

my company offered me a
position here in Los Angeles.

Does that mean you'd relocate
here permanently?

Maybe. What do you think?

I love it.

That's great!

Hi!

Hi! Just hang on.

Small world.

You did talk to her, didn't you?

Of course, I did.
I talked and talked and talked.

Hey! Look at Leonard
in his fancy-ass
grownup clothes.

Way to go, Priya.
For once, he doesn't look

like a mannequin in
the boys' department.

Hey, did he

tell you I saved
the silk shirt?

No, he did not.

He was gonna throw it
in the washing machine

with his
Spiderman underwear.

That's our Lenny, huh?

Yes, that's our Lenny.

So how's
the food here?

Oh, wow, that is
really, really good.

Oh, I'm sorry.
You guys are on a date.

We can hang out
anytime. Have fun.

Bye.
Good night.

Oh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot!

Whoo! It really
sneaks up on ya, huh?

All right, I gotta go.

It is pretty spicy.

Oh, I've been meaning
to tell you,

I figured out
your magic trick.

Really?

Oh, yes.

In fact, I improved upon it.

I'd love to see that.

How about you, Raj?

Beefaroni and a show?

How do you turn that down?

All right.

Pick a card.

Okay.

Bippity-boppity-boo.

What's with the wand
and the beep?

The wand is called showmanship,

and the beep is none
of your business.

Oh! Excuse me.

I'm getting a text message

completely unrelated
to this magic trick.

Oh, look, my
dry cleaning's ready.

And your card was
the five of spades. Ta-da.

These cards have barcodes
on them.

The wand is a reader.

It's transmitting to your phone.

I said, "ta-da."

Show's over.

That's pathetic.

Let me show you how
a real magician does it.

Raj, take a card.

Don't let me see it.

Okay.

Three of clubs.

Son of a gun,

you're blowing my mind!

Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!

That does it.
I'm getting uranium.

You ever gonna tell him?

Maybe.
When it stops being fun.

So never.

Oh, hey, I was
just on my way to work.

Oh, okay,
its not important.

It can wait.

No, it's all right.
Walk me down.

So, what's up?

Uh, I kind of have
a problem

I was hoping
you could help me with.

Sure, anything.

Move out.

What?

Not far.

Hey, if you ever wanna
start a family,

La Cañada has
some great schools.

Okay, I'm not
moving anywhere.

What the hell
is this all about?

Why does it have
to be about anything?

Can't a fella ask
his buddy to relocate,

no questions asked?

Oh, for God's sake,
Leonard,

this is about Priya,
isn't it?

She doesn't want me
hanging out with you.

Yes. There, I said it.

Okay, look.

I happen to like
your girlfriend.

And she likes you.

No, she doesn't.

Not really, no.

It doesn't matter.
Look, I promise from now on

I will keep
my distance from you.

Well, now, hold on.
What kind of distance

are we talking about?
Because we are neighbors.

I mean, I can hear the toilet
flush in your apartment.

You can hear my toilet flush?

I don't listen for it,
but it's nice to know

everything's okay
with your plumbing.

The building's plumbing.

Leonard, I get it.

You're in
a new relationship now.

And I'm happy for you.

So why don't we
just shake hands
and part friends?

Well, now hold on.

How about this?

How about we still hang out,
but on the down-low?

Are you really that kind of guy?

No.

I actually felt kinda silly just
saying "on the down-low."

Good-bye, Leonard.

Penny, wait.

Ah!

Damn contacts.

Incoming.

 Hi!
 Hey!

Hello.

Why so glum, chum?

Apparently,
you can't hack into

a government
supercomputer

and then try
to buy uranium

without the Department of
Homeland Security tattling

to your mother.

Oh, that's too bad.

Figure out the magic trick yet?

Figure out the magic trick yet?

Want me to tell you
how to do it?

No.

Ill show you one more time.

Raj?

Hang on.

This time do it with me,

so I can make sure
there's no monkey business.

All right.

Two of hearts.
I hate you.


Yeah, he's gonna win
the Nobel Prize.


Good evening.

I'm your guest lecturer,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

I was expecting applause,

but I suppose stunned silence
is equally appropriate.

I agreed to speak
to you this evening,

because I was told that you're
the best and the brightest

of this university's
doctoral candidates.

Hmm. Of course,
that's like saying

you are the most important
electron in a hydrogen atom.

'Cause, you see,

there's only one electron
in a hydrogen atom.

Best and brightest,
my sweet patootie.

All right, let's begin.

Show of hands,
who here is familiar

with the concept
of topological insulators?

Don't kid yourselves.

I found another tweet from a
student at Sheldon's lecture.

"Dr. Cooper has taken
a relatively boring subject

"and managed to make it
completely insufferable.

Plus, he looks
like a giant insect."

Look. Listen to this one.

"Does Einstein's theory
explain why time flies

"when you're having fun,

"but when you're listening
to Dr. Cooper,

it falls out of the sky, dead?"

Ooh, somebody took pictures

and uploaded them
to their Flickr account.

Wow.

How do you get an
entire lecture hall

to flip you off
at the same time?

Apparently, if you're Sheldon,

all you need
to do is turn your back.

Hey, Leonard,
is your wi-fi down?

I can't get on.

Oh, Sheldon changed
the password.

It's now
"Penny is a freeloader."

No spaces.

Thanks.
What are you guys doing?

Sheldon gave a lecture
at the university tonight.

We're reading
the reviews.

Oh. How'd he do?

Well, picture the Hindenburg
meets Chernobyl

meets Three Mile Island
meets Tron 2.

That bad, huh?

Read this woman's tweet.

"Listening to Dr. Cooper

has made me want to start
cutting myself again""

Yeah.

Good evening,
Leonard, Howard, Raj,

freeloader.

So, how'd the lecture go?

In a word, triumphant.

Really? Triumphant?

Oh, yes, you should have
seen those young people.

Thirsty for knowledge,
drinking in my wisdom.

I may have changed
a few lives today.

Oh, please let
me tell him.

I don't know,
I kind of promised Howard.

Tell me what?

Actually, we should
all share the moment.

Raj, if you would.

Oh, tweets about my lecture.

Hmm...

That's rather unfair.

That's downright cruel.

Plus, insects
have six legs.

Yeah, I'm not familiar
with the acronym "KMN""

From the context, we think
it means "kill me now."

Well, I suppose everyone's
entitled to their own opinion.

I think I'll turn in.

I didn't want to teach
those poopy heads, anyway.

FYI, I think that's
what Darth Vader said

just before he started
building the Death Star.

 


Sheldon still moping?

Yeah, it's weird.
Even though he didn't want

to give the lecture
in the first place,

being rejected by those students
really hit him hard.

I know the feeling.

It's like accidentally
walking into a gay bar

and then having
no one hit on you.

It-It happened
to a friend of mine.

Are you guys doing okay?

Leonard and I are fine,

but I think Raj needs
to meet a girl really soon.

Well, that shouldn't
be too hard.

He's such a cutie.

Thank you,
but "cute" is for bunnies.

I want to be something
with sex appeal,

like...
like a labradoodle.

Labradoodle?

We might be starting
to zero in on your problem.

Don't you listen to them.

You've got plenty
of sex appeal.

You really think so?

Yeah. You're a hottie.

Well, thanks, Bernadette.

And just for the record,

labradoodles are
hypo-allergenic,

which is a very sexy quality to
those troubled by animal dander.

AMY
So, what do you think?

It's a charming illusion,
but it does not cheer me up.

Not even when I do this?

No.

Well, that was the last arrow
in my quiver of whimsy.

Do you realize that teaching
is the first thing

I've failed at
since my ill-fated attempt

to complete a chin-up
in March of 1989?

If this humiliating experience

is really troubling you,

there are things
we could do about it.

For instance?

Well, the first thing
that comes to mind

is isolating the part
of your brain

where the memory is stored
and destroying it with a laser.

Hmm, no.

One slip of the hand,

and suddenly I'm sitting
in the Engineering Department,

building doodads with Wolowitz.

All right.

Have you considered improving
your socialization skills,

thus allowing you

to communicate more
effectively with other people?

Isn't that their burden?

I'm the one with something
interesting to say.

Fair enough, but in its essence,

teaching is a performance art.

In the classroom paradigm,

the teacher has the
responsibility to communicate,

as well as entertain and engage.

I sense that you're trying
to slow-walk me to an epiphany.

Would you mind very much
jumping to it?

Perhaps you should consider
taking acting lessons.

Acting lessons.

Interesting.

It might help
if I could act as though I care

about my students
and whether or not they learn.

Penny.

Penny. Penny.

What?

You're an "actress," correct?

I'm not an "actress."

I'm an actress.

All right.

You're an actress.

I need you to teach me.

You want an acting lesson?

Perhaps two. I'd like
to master the craft.

Okay, where
is this coming from?

It has been suggested to
me that acting techniques

could improve my
lecturing, at which,

if certain tweets and
blogs are to be believed,

I "suck the big one."

Yeah, I saw those.
They were funny.

I printed a few out
and put 'em on my fridge.

So, when could we start?

Okay, just to be clear.

You are asking me for help
because I know something

that the brilliant
Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.

I suppose that's one
way to look at it.

I think it's the only
way to look at it.

Are you going to
help me or not?

Probably. I'm just
enjoying the foreplay.

Does this mean you are done
mocking my acting career?

Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
making the transition

from actor to acting teacher

was the signal
that one's career

had reached the
end of the road.

Forget it.

I'll pay you $40.

Saturday, 9:00 a.m.
Bring cash.

Raj, I have amazing news!

What?

I just got offered
a fellowship

at the Weitzmann
Institute in Israel.

Dude, that's incredible!
I know.

The only thing is, I'm
gonna be gone for two years.

Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

Are you going with him?

I have to stay
here for school.

That's what we're here
to talk to you about.

You see,
Bernadette has needs.

What kind of needs?

Sexual needs.

Most of them regular,

some of them
kind of messed up.

So, while I'm gone,

you're going
to have to satisfy her.

What do you say?

I say okey-dokey.

What ya thinking
so hard about?

Just that
I'm definitely not gay.

SHELDON
Penny!

Penny! Penny!

What's wrong?

Nothing.
I was acting.

You were acting.

Yes. In preparation
for today's studies,

I read Stanislavski's
An Actor Prepares,

Stella Adler's
The Technique of Acting,

Uta Hagen's
Respect for Acting,

and Henry Winkler's
Ayyy, I'm an Actor.

Well, good for you.

Come on in.

How shall we begin?

Well, I thought we'd start

with some
basic movement exercises.

You know, get our bodies
warmed up a little.

All right.

So I just want you to relax

and kind of
move around in the space.

You know,
just do whatever feels natural.

Sheldon?

You said to do whatever
feels natural.

This feels natural.

Certainly more natural

than what you're doing.

Come on,
you got to work with me.

We need to get connected
with our bodies.

Penny, my body and I have
a relationship

that works best
when we maintain a cool,

wary distance from each other.

All right,
let's just say we've warmed up.

You're the "teacher."

Okay. One of the things
that might help you

in connecting with your students

is being
a little more spontaneous.

So why don't we
try some improvisation?

Why not?
It seems like

you're improvising
your entire curriculum.

This is all about
listening and responding.

Gotcha.

I'm going to create a character

and a situation, and you
just jump in when you feel it.

All right.
All right.

Action.

Okay, it's not a movie.

It's improv.
So no one calls "action."

Hey, you taught me something.

Who would have thought it?

Okay.

Uh, no, the shipment
has not arrived,

and I really need those shoes.

They are my biggest seller.

Yes, ladies sizes six
through ten.

Thank you.
Oh, sorry.

I have to go.
I have a customer. Bye-bye.

Hi. Can I help you?

I'd like a frozen yogurt,
please.

Yogurt?

Yeah.
Um...

Okay, sure.

Luckily, we sell both shoes
and yogurt here.

You do?

Yes. Look up at the sign,

and remember, improv is always
about saying yes.

All right.

Yes.

I see a sign.

It says "Camarillo State
Mental Hospital."

What?

It's the only explanation
I can come up with

for why you think
you sell shoes and yogurt.

Okay, you know what?

Let's just try
a different improv. Uh..

Oh, this time
we will be two winos

living under a freeway overpass.

Oh, and we're going
to use props?

You bet.

I had dreams,
you know.

I was gonna be famous.

Show everybody back home
I could be someone.

Now look at me.

Want some?

You have any frozen yogurt?

I'm still not adjusted

to how the SyFy channel
spells their name now.

S-y-F-y.
That's "siffy."

Uh-huh.

Hello?

Oh, my God! Is he okay?

What happened?
Hang on. Hang on.

Uh-huh.

Okay, thank you.

Howard was on his scooter,
and got hit by a truck.

He's in critical condition.

Oh, no!

Did you hear?

Isn't it terrible?

Have you seen him?

They wouldn't let me in.

Oh, my Howie.

It'll be okay.
It'll be okay.

It'll be okay.

It'll be
okay.

It's Howard.

Howard, hello.

Raj, is that you?

Yeah, I'm right here,
buddy. How are you?

Shh, shh. Listen to me.

I'm not gonna make it.

No, no, no,
don't say that.

You're going to
be all right.

Raj, I don't have time.
Now, pay attention.

My last wish is that
you look after Bernadette.

Of course, of course.

Now when you say "look
after," you mean...

Sexually.

Excuse me, Bernadette.
I have to hear it from him.

Sexually.

Got it. Take care.

I guess I have no choice

but to make sweet,
guilt-free love to you

over and over again
for the rest of my life.

That's how I heard it.

Or it could be "sy-fee."

What?

S-y-F-y. "Sy-fee."

Oh, right.

Good one.

So, did you get a chance
to go over the scene I gave you?

Yes. I didn't care for it.

Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof
is an American classic.

So is the McRib sandwich.

I don't care
for that, either.

Fine. What would you rather do
as a scene study?

I'm glad you asked.

I took the liberty

of adapting a Star Trek
fan fiction novella

I wrote when I was ten

into a one-act play.

And you think it's better
than Tennessee Williams?

Why don't we leave that for
future generations to decide?

Where No Sheldon
Has Gone Before.

It's the story of a young boy
who is transported

from the ignorant backwoods
of East Texas

to the 23rd Century,

where his genius is not only
appreciated, but celebrated.

KMN...

Now, in this
pivotal scene,

Sheldon's mother, played by you,
argues with an emissary

of the United Federation
of Planets, Mr. Spock,

the role I will bring to life.

Okay, that's fine,
but let's try

and get you out
of your comfort zone.

Why would we want to do that?

It's called "the comfort zone"
for a reason.

Okay, the whole point of this is
to loosen you up a little,

so I'm thinking you'll play
the role of your mother,

and I will bring life
to Mr. Spock.

I'm sorry.

You'll be Spock?

It's only logical.

Very well.

I'll set the scene.

All right.

"East Texas.

"A warm summer night.

"A woman, Mary,

"stands on a porch.

In the distance, we hear a
lonesome train whistle..."

"The droning buzz of cicadas..""

"A coyote howls at the moon,

frightening sensitive young boys
everywhere."

"Out in the woods,

an owl screeches..."
Okay, okay.

We get it.
You set the scene.

Hoo!

Now just read
your mother's line.

"Shelly!

"Shelly, how many times
have I told you

"not to leave your sciencey
stuff out on the porch?

"Goodness,

"I'll never understand that boy.

"But then again,
I'm a religious nut,

and my mind is closed
to so many things."

"Spock to Enterprise.
Transport successful."

"Glory be to Heaven,

"some sort of creature
just manifested out of thin air.

"George, put down that Pepsi can
full of bourbon

that ain't foolin' no one,
and get your shotgun!"

"Greetings, Mary Cooper.

I am Spock."

I'm sorry.
I just don't buy it.

Just keep going!

"Oh, my, your sudden appearance
startles me."

"We have been monitoring
your son Sheldon

"from the 23rd Century, and

"we have determined
that he is now ready

"to join us.

"His unique genius
is our best hope

for bringing peace
to a vast and troubled galaxy."

"I understand.

"Oh, Shelly?

"A man's here
to take you away to the future!

Be sure to pack
clean underwear."

Okay, okay, let's try
that last line again,

and this time,
maybe try choking up

a little.
Why?

Well, you're losing your son.

Yes, but he's going
to a better place

where he won't get beat up...
so much.

All right, come on,
just try it my way.

Pretend you're sad
to see him go.

I'm gonna lead you in.

"His unique genius
is our best hope

for bringing peace
to a vast and troubled galaxy."

 That's your cue.
 I'm sorry. I just love that line.

Even the way you do it.

All right, come on, come on.

Put some real emotion into it.

Blah-blah, blah, blah...
"vast and troubled galaxy."

Go.
Hmm.

"Oh, Shelly?

A man's here
to take you away to the future""

"Be sure to pack clean
underwear."

That's good. That's good.
That's good.

Mommy, why are you crying?

'Cause I'm gonna
miss you, Shelly-bean,

even though you creep
the bugeeses out of me.

Okay, I guess
we're improvising now.

I'm sorry.

It's not my fault.

I'm just incredibly smart,

and everyone around here is
dumber than a bag of rocks.

Oh, now, don't
you start crying.

You get in that spaceship.

Mommy's late for
Indian bingo.

Mrs. Cooper, hey, it's Penny.

Yeah, I think I broke your son.

Hey, hold on.

Talk to your mother.

Mommy, I love you.

Don't let Spock take
me to the future!

Okay, Raj,

I know you've been avoiding me
and Howard, and I'm not leaving

until you tell me
what's going on

inside that little head
of yours.

 Like the wild elephant 

 I am trumpeting
my love for you! 

 Like a hidden flower 

 My sweet fragrance
comes into view! 

 My heart burns for you
like the sun at noon! 

 My desert welcomes you
like the rainy monsoon! 

 You are my heart! 

 My universe! 

 You are my heart! 

 My universe! 

 My universe! 

 Hey! 

 You are my heart! 

 My universe! 

 You are my heart! 

 My universe! 

 You are my heart! 

 My universe! 

 My universe! 

Dance number aside,
I'm so not gay.



Water Demon.

Ice Dragon.

Lesser Warlord
of Ka'a.

Not so fast.

Infinite Sheldon.

Infinite Sheldon?

Yes, Infinite Sheldon
defeats all other cards

and does not violate the
rule against homemade cards

because I made
it at work.

Do you understand why people
don't want to play with you?

No...

although it's a question I've
been pondering since preschool.

Hey.

Hey.

Hey.

Hey, your copy of Science
magazine was in my mailbox.

 Oh, thanks.
 Mm-hmm.

Check it out--
all about planets this month.

That's an atom.

Agree to disagree.

That's what I love
about science--

there's no
one right answer.

So...

you and Zack again, huh?

Yeah, yeah, me
and Zack again.

Were we here earlier?

Okay, we should,
we should go.

Ah, not yet.

I want to talk science
with the science dudes.

Oh, and the science dudes want
to talk science with you.

What do you want
to talk about--

rocks, dinosaurs, our
friend the beaver?

You know, I saw this great thing
on the Discovery Channel.

Turns out
that if you kill a starfish,

it'll just come back to life.

Was the starfish
wearing boxer shorts?

Because you might have
been watching Nickelodeon.

No, I'm almost sure that
it was the Discovery Channel.

It was a great show.

They also said dolphins
might be smarter than people.

They might be smarter
than some people.

Maybe we can do an
experiment to find out.

That's easy enough.

We'd need a large tank of
water, a hoop to jump through,

and a bucket of whatever
bite-sized treats

you find tasty.

I don't get it.

A dolphin might.

Oh, I see.

You guys are inferring
that I'm stupid.

That's not correct.

We were implying it.

You then inferred it.

Let's go.

You know, for a group of guys

who claim they spent most
of their lives being bullied,

you can be real jerks.

Shame on all of you.

What the hell did I do?

You laughed.

 


Do you think
Penny's right?

Were we bullying Zack?

No,

I know bullying.

He left here unswirlied and his
ass crack was underpants-free.

And nobody drew
a penis on his forehead.

That happened to you?

First day of cricket camp.

They drew it
so the testicles were my eyes.

I don't know, I think
we might owe the guy an apology.

So go apologize.
Why me?

You started it,
we just piled on.

What would I even say?

Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid.

Have a Milk Dud.

A Milk Dud?
Yeah,

Milk Duds,
with their self-deprecating name

and remarkably mild flavor,

are the most apologetic
of the boxed candies.

I got a better idea.

We're all responsible.

I say we all go.

Come on, who's with me?

Free comic books
to anyone who comes with me.

I might get punched.
You really want to miss that?

Junior Mints are
pretty apologetic.

You're embarrassing
yourself.

Penny.

What?
Yeah,

we came to talk to Zack.
Hey, Zack.

What do you want?

Listen,

the stuff
we were saying before--

we were just kidding around.

No, you weren't.

You were making fun
of me.

Come on, that's what we do.

We give each other a hard time.

Hey, Sheldon,

you look
like a praying mantis.

That's very hurtful.

See?

I don't know,
it still wasn't very nice.

Milk Dud?

Oh, I love Milk Duds.

Okay, we're cool.

Junior Mints.

You guys want to come in
and have a beer?

Uh, we're on our way
to the comic book store.

Leonard's buying.

Really?

I haven't been
to a comic book store

in literally
a million years.

Literally?

Literally a
million years?

Don't.

You want to go with 'em?
No.

Okay, see you later.
Wait,

w-w-w-wait, you're ditching me
to go look at comic books?

Are you mad at me?

I'm not happy.

Milk Dud?

Wow, this place
is awesome.

Where do they keep
the Archies?

In the bedrooms of ten-year-
old girls, where they belong.

Oh, no, you're thinking
old-school Archie.

It's much more
sophisticated now.

Like, there's
two universes,

and Archie's married
to Betty in one

and Veronica
in the other.

Midge is even breaking
up with Moose.

No.

About time, right?

Hey.

Hey.
You guys finally chip in
for a bodyguard?

Uh, no. Oh,
this is Zack.

He's a friend
of ours.

Zack, this is Stuart.

He owns
the store.

Wow, lucky you.

Yeah, I work
70 hours a week

and average
$1.65 an hour.

Sweet.

Is that sarcasm?

No, it's an indictment of the
American education system.

The Archies are over here.

Yippee.

So are you guys coming to
my New Year's Eve costume party?

Of course.

We're coming as the
Justice League of America.

Switching it up from last year

when we came as
the Justice League of America.

To that point,

it occurs to me that we
might have an opportunity

to finally snare
Best Group Costume

if we shore up
our weak link,

which is clearly
Leonard as Superman.

Hey, I got
new boots this year.

Guaranteed to add
three inches.

That's sad.

Is there anyone we know

who would make a more manly
and convincing son of Krypton?

Than Leonard
in high-heeled boots?

Howard's mother
in high-heeled boots?

I was thinking specifically
of the gentleman over there

moving his lips
as he enjoys

the latest exploits
of Betty and Veronica.

Zack?

He is the only person we know
with actual muscles.

You can't replace
me with Zack.

Why not?
Penny did it.

Yeah, she seems happier.

Why wouldn't we be?

Score.

I got an Archie,
Betty and Veronica,

and a Jughead.

All set
for my weekend number twos.

Congratulations.

Zack, how would you
like to be Superman?

I don't know, sounds like
a lot of responsibility.

Fine, if Zack's going
to be Superman,

I want to be
Green Lantern.

But I'm Green Lantern.

You can be Aquaman.

I don't want to be Aquaman.

He sucks.

He sucks
underwater.

He sucks
fish pee.

Excuse me,

I believe Aquaman uses
his telepathic powers

to request the fish do
their business elsewhere.

Hey, babe.

I'm still mad at you.

Well, you won't be

when you hear the great news.

What great news?

We're going to
a costume party

at the comic book store
on New Year's Eve,

and you get to
be Wonder Woman.

Complete with bulletproof
bracelets and lasso of truth.

Invisible plane sold separately.

Wait, why me?

Wh-Why can't your girlfriend
be Wonder Woman?

She and her lab team
are under quarantine.

Seems at the Christmas party
they were doing Jell-O shots

out of petri dishes that used
to contain yellow fever.

Okay, what about
your friend Amy?

Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't
believe in wearing costumes.

She isn't the free spirit I am.

Okay, well, forget it.

I'm not spending
my New Year's Eve

at a comic book store
wearing a Wonder Woman costume.

He says he'll wear it
if you'll be Aquaman.

What are you doing?

We're going
to be late.

I'm pacing nervously.

You're jogging.

This is how the
Flash paces.

Just chill out, Sheldon.

I'm not Sheldon.
I'm the Flash.

And now I'm going
to the Grand Canyon

to scream in frustration.

I'm back.

I'm Batman.

Oh, I hardly think so.

The real caped crusader calls
his crime-fighting cohorts

when he's running late.

I had to walk.

I couldn't get Raj
on the back of my scooter.

I've said this before,
and I'll say it again.

Aquaman sucks.

Look up in the sky.
It's a bird. It's a plane.

I forget the rest.

All right. Let's get
this thing over with.

I'm sorry.

But in what universe
is Wonder Woman blonde?

Relax. No one's going to
be looking at her hair.

Ow!

I mean,

ow.

Hold on. The costume came

with a black wig.
Where is it, babe?

No. I'm not wearing
it. It looks stupid.

Come on. We're trying
to win a contest here.

Forget it. I'm not
wearing the wig.

Honey, there's no "I"
in "Justice League."

Well, actually...

Don't.
He's making our case.

Okay, babe. Uh...

Kind of embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

Okay.
You know what?

I changed my mind.
I'm not going.

Looks like someone
else is going

to have to be Wonder Woman.

Babe, open up.

I'm not talking to you.

Then who are you talking to?

Babe?

Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny,

Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,

Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny

Penny, Penny...

What the hell
is wrong with you?

I'm the Flash.

I just knocked 30,000 times.

Okay. What do you
want, Sheldon?

I understand
why you're upset.

Really?

Yes.

You're afraid that costume
makes you look fat.

No.

Wh-What...

Does it?

Don't worry.

Wonder Woman
was an Amazon.

And Amazons tend to
be very beefy gals.

Good-bye, Sheldon.

But they're not blonde,
so put on your wig.

Hello?

Stupid Aquaman.

If it makes you
feel any better,

when I was dating Penny,

she used to flip out
on me all the time.

Whoa. You dated Penny?

She didn't tell you?

She told me she dated
a guy named Leonard.

Who would have
thought it was you?

Who else would it be?

I don't know. Somebody
bigger and...

Yeah, sure.
Why not you?

I may have failed.

Okay, I guess we just go
without a Wonder Woman.

I don't want to go
without Penny.

Oh, great. No Superman,
no Wonder Woman?

All we've got is a skinny Flash,

an Indian Aquaman,

a nearsighted
Green Lantern,

and a teeny, tiny
Dark Knight.

Obviously, we're no longer
a Justice League.

We have no choice but to switch
to our Muppet Baby costumes.

Ooh, I call Kermit.

I'm Kermit.
You're Scooter.

Oh, man.
Scooter sucks.

He's the Aquaman
of the Muppet Babies.

No, we can still
make this work.

Leonard,
you talk to Penny.

What makes you think
I can convince her?

You got her
to have sex with you.

Obviously, your superpower
is brainwashing.

Okay, let me see
if I understand this.

You want me
to convince my ex-girlfriend

to go to a costume party
with her new boyfriend

just so we can win
a stupid prize?

Yes. And make her wear
the black wig. Good luck.

Go away, Sheldon.

It's Leonard.

Oh.

Go away, Leonard.

Come on, let me
just talk to you.

It's open.

Hey.

I'm not going
to that party, Leonard.

Okay, listen.
You don't have to wear the wig.

At this party,
we're gonna win first prize

just by showing up with a girl.

It's not the wig.

Did I do something?

I mean, I tried to be
friends with Zack,

like you said, which believe me,
was difficult,

given how you and me
used to be...

you know, "you and
me," and now you

and him are
"you and him."

Okay, look.
We're not really "me and him."

Then what are you?

I don't know.

I only started seeing Zack again

so I wouldn't be alone
on New Year's Eve.

How pathetic is that?

Not as pathetic
as dressing up like this

and going to a comic book store
on New Year's Eve.

You make a cute Green Arrow.

Green Lantern.

Like there's a difference.

There's a big difference.

Arrow.

Lantern.

Whatever. Look,
if Zack and I had just gone

to a regular club or a party,
it would have been fine,

but this, with the costumes,
and you...

What about me?

Nothing.

Let's go to the party.

How do I look?

Um...

I guarantee you'll be
the prettiest girl there.

Okay, the good news is,
we have a Wonder Woman.

Oh.
Yes.

What's the bad news?

Superman probably isn't

getting laid tonight.

Aw, damn.

And the award

for best group costume
goes to...

Justice League of America...

Number three!

Thank you!
Thank you so much!

Okay. Okay, ten
seconds to midnight.

Ten, nine, eight...

No, wait!

I have a speech.

Seven, six...
Stop counting!

Five, four, three...
This is my moment, dag nab it!

Two, one!

Happy New Year!

I'm not going
to say another word

until you people settle down.

I'm waiting.

That was a
great party.

We should dress like
this all the time.

Are you high?

You're being
a bully.

Check it out.

Those guys are breaking
into that car.

What should we do?

We're the Justice League
of America.

There's only one thing
we can do.

Turn around
and slowly walk away.

Nah.

Hold up.

Look, I know our winter
thermostat setting

is 72 degrees,
but I'm a little warm,

so I'm going
to turn it down.

Good Lord,

how you frustrate me,
Leonard Hofstadter!


Fine.


Completely empty box,
if you'd like to examine it.

Mm-hm.

Yep. I see nothing in this box
but a wasted childhood.

Little snarky there, cello lessons.

We have this completely ordinary
cylinder if you'd like to examine it.

Ordinary, yet I sense it
is dripping with magical potential.

Oh, dear Lord.

A man pops out for a moment
to evacuate his bowels...

and catch up on the adventures
of the Caped Crusader only to emerge...

and discover his apartment has been
transformed into a cabaret.

Sheldon, he's practicing
for his cousin's birthday party.

As I was saying,
empty box, empty cylinder, and...

Ooh!

Voilà.

I'm telling you, there's a seat on the
Hogwart's Express with your name on it.

This is how you're going to entertain
your little cousin and his friends?

 By lying to them?
 How is this lying?

A magic show is an inherently
deceitful proposition.

"This is an ordinary top hat."
"You've chosen that card freely."

"I do not have a set
of lock picks lodged in my keister."

Can't you just enjoy the wonder?

Why must you peek
behind the curtain, or up the butt?

If we poison the critical thinking
faculties of children...

by telling them
rabbits come out of hats...

then we create adults who believe
in astrology and homeopathy...

and Ryan Reynolds was a
better choice for Green Lantern...

than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.

He's just gonna do
a few magic tricks for some kids.

I really don't think they're gonna
end up liking the Green Lantern movie.

Don't be so hard on him, it's natural
to be a little cranky when you have...

a quarter in your ear.

Coins lodged in body parts
is not a source of amusement.

When I was five, Billy Sparks
put a Mexican peso up my nose.


 How is that not amusing?
 It's still there.

It takes me 45 minutes
to get through airport security.

Look. I made Sheldon disappear.
Ta-da!

Next time you should open with that.

Ooh! Look who's out on a date. Pasadena's
favorite power couple, Shamy.

And that is the answer
to the question:

"What is wrong with
eating at the Cheesecake Factory?"

So are we celebrating
anything special tonight?

Oh, yes.

Our relationship agreement specifies
the second Thursday of every month...

or the third Thursday in a month
with five Thursdays is date night.

That is so hot.

All right, without objection,
the minutes of the previous date...

are considered read
and agreed to. Any new business?

 How was your day?
 Superb.

This morning I made
a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits.

"Nice Hat, Bob Tahecin."

Sounds like you hit the ground running.

I have a bit of good news myself.

My most recent paper on how
cooperative long-term potentiation...

can map memory sequences
in dendritic branches...

made the cover of Neuron.

Ooh! Peaking of good news,
somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.

That's nice. Anyway, I've been
dreaming of this day for a long time.

Yeah, me too. Triple digits.
I'm not gonna lie, feels pretty good.

I'm the sole author on a paper
being published...

in a distinguished journal that
may change the course of my field.

Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Ooh!

One-oh-one!
Air's getting a bit thin up here.

So are we ready to order?

Give me a minute.
I'm gonna go wash up.

Well, that's odd.
We both washed up when we came in.

It's probably a euphemism
for urination.

 Sheldon, what is wrong with you?
 Not much.

Although I can be faulted
for being overly fond of koala bears.

I don't know what it is, when they start
munching on eucalyptus, I melt inside.

Okay. Amy told you some exciting news
and you acted like it was no big deal.

Oh! I see why you're confused. No.

Her news sounded important,
but what you're forgetting is...

it was an achievement
in the field of biology.

That's all about yucky squishy things.

All right, honey, she's upset.
You're her boyfriend.

You have to at least try to be excited
by the things she's excited by.

 What if they simply don't excite me?
 Well, just smile and think about koalas.

She'd see right through that.
We go to the zoo all the time.

She knows my koala face.

And for future reference, it's this.

Wow, you have a lot of magic stuff.

Yeah, started when I was a teenager.

Thought I could show a girl a few tricks
and invite her up to my bedroom...

to see the rest of the act.

 Did it work?
 Let's just say...

the only wand that ever saw any action
was this one.

Oh! Look what my mom
made us for the act.

Ooh! I like the fabric.
Where'd she get it?

Well, she cut up
one of her old bathing suits.

She made these two vests
and half a dozen napkins.

Has she tried on the vest yet?

 I hope it fits.

She has a tricky figure.
She's short and stacked like me.

She's not stacked like you, Ma.
She never steps on hers.

Listen, Howie. Maybe I'm not the
best choice to be a magician's assistant.

You'll do fine. Hand me those rings?

See? You nailed it.

No, it's just that I'm not
that comfortable with little kids.

That's because you
haven't been around them.

This is good practice. I mean, you are
gonna be a mom someday, right?

Yeah, sure.

Oh, ho, ho!

I haven't seen this trick in years.

It's called the dove pan. You let
everyone see the pan is empty...

but there's a secret
compartment in the lid.

And then you open it
and produce a live...



Don't look in there.


Oh, a little "Red Dead Redemption," huh?

 Yes.
 How come you're not doing a mission?

You're just wandering around.

I had a rough night, thought I'd
go for a walk and clear my head.

Some people
go outside and do that.

It's after 9:00.
At this hour, the streets of Pasadena...

are teeming with
drunken sailors and alley cats.

Do you wanna talk about it?

No, I think I'll just go in this
saloon and drink my troubles away.

You know digital alcohol
is never a solution.

What's going on?

Hard as this may be to believe...

it's possible that I'm
not boyfriend material.

Glad I was sitting down for that.

Did you and Amy get in a fight?

Amy had a fight.
I was being perfectly reasonable.

I'm gonna have a whiskey.
Want anything?

No, I can't.
I'm playing "Grand Theft Auto" later.

 Look, I'm no expert in women...
 I'll say.

Not necessary when
someone's trying to help you.

Sorry, it's the alcohol talking.
Go on.

Sometimes with women
you wanna listen to what upsets them...

and show them that you
can grow and change.

Nuts to that. What else you got?

I don't know what to tell you.
Buy her something.

How does that work?

Well, you skip over any attempt
to repair your emotional connection...

and you win back her affection
with an empty financial gesture.

Well, that approach has
Sheldon Cooper written all over it.

 Glad I could help.
 It's appreciated.

If you manage to find a woman again,
I'll be glad to return the favor.

And now, all the rings
are magically linked together.

My fiancée's wearing a magic ring too.
It made all my money disappear.

Oh, oh, right.


And now, the Great Howdini's
next miraculous illusion.

When are we gonna have cake?

After you've been thoroughly amazed.

But we want cake now.

Well, you're not getting
cake right now, capiche?

Heh, heh, okay, okay.

Now my lovely assistant
is going to bring me...

 ...an ordinary pitcher of milk.
 I know how you do that trick.

Do you know how to pipe down?

Okay, we're going to
roll up this newspaper.

 It's a fake pitcher.
 You got wax in your ears?

The man said it's an ordinary pitcher.

Howdini?

Okay. We're going to stick this
in here.

And then I'm going to pour in
the milk.

Ha, ha, I hope this works because
I didn't bring a change of pants.

Look, I Googled it.
It's a fake pitcher.

That's it. No cake for you.
Anyone else wanna join the No Cake Club?

She's just kidding, boys and girls.
Everyone gets cake.

Not him.

Just give me the pitcher.

Behold.

Wrong pitcher.


I told you I'm not good with kids.

Yes, you did.

I think my crotch is starting to curdle.

The thing is,
my mother worked full-time.

I had to take care of
my brothers and sisters.

 Yeah, so?
 Uh, it was horrible.

With their snotty noses
and their poopy diapers...

and their little shrieky voices,
always complaining.

"I don't wanna get dressed."
"Joey keeps spitting in my mouth."

"This isn't the way Mom
makes waffles."

Well, okay, put your hand in here.
Let's see how you like this waffle.

All right, settle down.
Red light. Red light.

Red light. Okay, we're fine.

I'm sorry. I know it makes me
sound like a bad person...

 ...but I just don't like children.
 Yeah, no, we all got that.

But don't you think it'll be
different when the child is ours?

Right. When it's our kid that's ruined
my body, kept me up all night...

and I've got no career, no future,
nothing to be happy about for 20 years.

Sure, that'll be completely different.

Well, yeah.

I don't think there's anything
in this jewelry store...

that Amy would appreciate more than
the humidifier we're looking at at Sears.

Oh, my God. Now I know what I sound
like to you when I say stupid stuff.

Ooh! A pocket watch.

I don't think Amy
wants a pocket watch.

No, but maybe she wants
a man with a pocket watch.

Still saying stupid stuff.

 Does she like bracelets?
 Well, she's very fond of her silver one...

that says "allergic to penicillin."

Maybe they have
a dressier version of that.

How are we doing this afternoon?
Looking for anything special?

Perhaps a ring for the lady?


Trust me, we are not a couple.

Excuse me. I don't see why
you get to snort derisively...

and point that out.
You'd be lucky to land a fellow like me.

Fine. Go ahead.


Trust me, we are not a couple.

My apologies.
How can I help you today?

He's in trouble with his girlfriend,
needs a present.

Great. Trouble with girlfriends is what's
putting my daughter through U.S.C.

Ooh!

 Are those real diamonds?
 Yes.

Channel-set baguettes,
20 points total weight.

Remarkable. Diamonds.
Crystallized carbon.

Every day, people go to the grocery
store and come home with sacks...

full of carbon in the form
of charcoal briquettes...

they toss in their barbecues
and set on fire.

But just because you've got some
carbon with the atoms stacked neatly...

you expect me to plunk down
thousands of dollars.

Actually, that's only 750.
Everything's on sale.

Really? Talk to me
about that pocket watch.

I'm still trying to wrap
my mind around it.

I always thought
I'd be a dad someday.

Me too. You're so caring.

I've often pictured you guiding
a young boy into manhood.

There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj'll
have your babies. Problem solved.

Because a man
shows caring for another man...

doesn't mean he's displaying the love
that dare not speak its name.

Did she say she didn't want kids?

Yeah. She doesn't like them.

And from what I saw,
the feeling was mutual.

 What are you gonna do?
 I don't know.

I can't see a life where I don't have kids.
I mean, people have kids.

I mean, even Donkey Kong
had Donkey Kong Jr.

So he could teach someone
how to kidnap princesses...

and throw barrels
at Italian plumbers.

You know, there's no guarantee even if
you have kids you're gonna like them.

Wow, that's rough.
Where'd you get that?

It's right off the dust jacket
of my mom's last book.

Maybe me and Bernadette
aren't right for each other.

Look, Howard, I'd say
there's a lot of fish in the sea...

but I watched you dangle your hook
for years.

Do not throw her back.

I don't want to,
but this is kind of a deal breaker.

What will your mom say
if you call off the wedding?

Heh, it'll kill her.
If I don't give her grandchildren...

that'll kill her too. So either way
on the Mom front, I'm golden.

 What time did you tell Amy to be here?
 Eight o'clock.

 That pocket watch is ridiculous.
 Nonsense.

I look like a train conductor.

Under what pretext
did you lure her here?

I said, "Hey, wanna come
over and hang out?"

Good, good. If you'd said something clever,
she might've gotten suspicious.

 Hey.
 Hi.

 What's he doing here?
 Okay, he wants to talk to you.

Well, I don't wanna talk to him.
And I'm pretty disappointed in you too.

Although we both know
that won't last.

 Sheldon, you're up.
 Thank you.

Amy, I'd like to apologize.

Your accomplishment was impressive,
and I'm proud of you.

 We both know that's your koala face.
 I told you.

Okay, look. He bought you this.

Jewelry? Seriously?

Sheldon, you are the most shallow,
self-centered person I have ever met.

You think another
transparently manipulative...

Oh, it's a tiara!

A tiara. I have a tiara. Put it on me,
put it on me, put it on me...

put it on me, put it on me,
put it on me.

You look beautiful.

Of course I do.
I'm a princess and this is my tiara.

You were right.
The tiara was too much.

Howard, Bernadette's...

Oh. She slipped right by me.

 Here's your vest back.
 You should keep it.

 You could wear it again sometime.
 Where?

I don't know, hunting?

Don't forget to talk to her
about this meshugas...

where I don't get grandkids.

as soon as I can figure out...

a way to bring up
such a sensitive issue.

 Guess you talked to your mom.

My mom can be
a pretty good shoulder to cry on...

if the smell of Bengay
doesn't burn your eyes.

Look, it's obvious having kids
is really important to you...

and I think I came up
with a solution.

Really? That's great. What?

Well, seeing as how I make
way more money than you anyway...

what if I work
and you stay home with the kids?

 Me?
 Yeah.

You know, you'll watch Barney
and pull Cheerios out of their noses...

and go on play dates and I'll work
and have conversations...

with people my own age
and enjoy my life.

 Yeah.
 Yay! So we're good.

Yeah, we're good.

I don't know if this counted as a fight...

but how about some make-up sex?

I would love that.
But what is that behind your ear?

Oh, look, it's a condom.



you are considering
going into experimental physics,

my door is always open.

Once again, I'm sorry

that the demonstration
didn't quite work out,

but now we know what happens
when you accidentally spill

Peach Snapple into
a helium neon laser.

Short answer is... don't.

And now to tell you about the
theoretical physics department

is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Dr. Cooper?

SHELDON:
Forget it.

Excuse me.

Sheldon, we both
agreed to do this.

It's a waste
of time.

I might as well explain
the laws of thermodynamics

to a bunch
of labradoodles.

If you don't do this,

I won't take you
to the comic book store.

Hello.

Nice work with
the laser, by the way.

Looking out at your
fresh young faces,

I remember when I too was
deciding my academic future

as a lowly graduate student.

Of course, I was 14.

And I'd already achieved more
than most of you

could ever hope to,
despite my 9:00 bedtime.

Now, there may be one or two
of you in this room

who has what it takes to succeed
in theoretical physics.

Although, it's more likely
that you'll spend

your scientific careers teaching
fifth graders

how to make papier mache
volcanoes with baking soda lava.

Oh, good God.
In short--

any one who told you that you
would someday be able

to make any significant
contribution to physics,

played a cruel trick on you,
a cruel trick indeed.

Any questions?

Of course not.

I weep for the future
of science.

Now if you'll excuse me, the
latest issue of Batman is out.

Come, Leonard.

Laser demonstration's looking
pretty good now, huh?

The Big Bang Theory S02E06 - The Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem

Sync By GeR - http://gerdiffuse.free.fr

Transcript : YYETS

I love this time
of the year.

The leaves are turning,

there's a bracing chill
in the air.

Plus there's a whole new crop
of female grad students

about to put on just enough
winter weight

to make them needy
and vulnerable.

That's right, honey,
have another calzone.

Daddy can wait.

Isn't there a university policy

against dating
graduate students?

No, if you can talk to them,
you can ask them out.

Damn, there's always a catch.

Hey, guys.
Hey, Leslie.

So, dumbass, I heard you made
a grad student

throw up last night.

The truth can indeed be
a finger down the throat

of those unprepared to hear it.

But why should I cater
to second-rate minds?

Because first-rate minds
call you "dumbass"?

Oh, yeah? Well...

you're a mean person.

Excuse me, Dr. Cooper,

I'm Ramona Nowitzki.

I was at your talk
last night.

I think you're just brilliant.

That is the prevailing
opinion.

Oh, now I'm gonna throw up.

Howard Wolowitz,
department of engineering,

co-designer of the
International Space Station's

Liquid Waste Disposal System.

Ew.

Dr. Cooper, I've read
everything you've published.

I especially liked your paper
on grand unification

using string-network condensates

and wawondering
how you determined

that three-dimensional
string-nets provided

a unified picture of ferrnions

and gauge bosons?

Amazing, an intelligent
labradoodle.

Woof.

The fact is I'm quite
close to a breakthrough

in showing how neutrinos emerge
from a string-net condensate.

Oh, my God, that would
change the way we view

the entire physical universe.

It's what I do.

You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz
Liquid Waste Disposal System

is turning a few
heads as well.

Again, ew.

You know, I'd love to hear more

about how you intend
to add neutrinos.

Could we get a cup
of coffee sometime?

I don't drink coffee.

I do. I love me a cup of joe.

Well, it doesn't have
to be coffee.

How about dinner?

I do eat dinner.

Great. I know a terrific
little Italian place.

I never eat
in strange restaurants.

One runs the risk
of non-standard cutlery.

Excuse me?

Sheldon lives in fear
of the three-tined fork.

Three tines is not a fork.

Three tines is a trident.

Forks are for eating,

tridents are for
ruling the seven seas.

What if I brought food
to your place?

That would be acceptable.

On Mondays, I eat Thai food.

Mee krob and chicken sate

with extra peanut sauce
from Siam Palace.

You got it.

I already have your address.

What a nice girl.

Sheldon, do you have
any idea what just happened?

Yes. Apparently I'm getting
a free dinner.

Oh, yeah, no, this thing's
majorly out of order.

See? Sorry.

That's okay.

Guess I'm taking
the stairs.

Where you going?

4-A.

Oh, are you here
to see Leonard?

No, Dr. Cooper.

Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

We're having dinner.

Sheldon Cooper?

Tall, thin,

looks a little like
a giant praying mantis?

He is cute, isn't he?

Sheldon Cooper?

Hi, Leonard.

Hey, Ramona. Come on in.

Thanks. Where should
I put this?

Uh, the kitchen's fine.

Hey, what are you doing?

I need to see this.
Uh-huh.

The viewing area's
right over there.

Sheldon, your girl... date...
person... Ramona's here.

Oh, hello.

Oh, sorry I'm late.

I just got so caught up reading
the draft of your latest paper.

Did you enjoy
the humorous footnote

where I illustrate
mirror-symmetry

by likening it to the Flash
playing tennis with himself?

So funny.

But the idea that you might be
able to incorporate gravity,

I have to tell you, I found
it  physically exhilarating.

My hypotheses tend
to have that effect.

I'm sorry I didn't
bring enough

for your friends.

I assumed we were
going to be alone.

Oh, yeah.

No, we were just going.

To watch, right?

No, come on, now,
we're going out.

Oh, come on,
we'll be quiet.

Let's go, let's go.

Okay, you two.

Have a nice...

whatever this is.

Okay, you guys, look,

I know this is none
of my business,

but I just... I have to ask--

what's Sheldon's deal?

What do you mean "deal"?

You know, like what's his deal?

Is it girls...? Guys...?
Sock puppets...?

Honestly, we've been operating
under the assumption

that he has no deal.

Come on, everybody has a deal.

Not Sheldon.

Over the years, we've
formulated many theories

about how he might reproduce.

I'm an advocate
of mitosis.

I'm sorry?

I believe one day Sheldon
will eat an enormous amount

of Thai food and split
into two Sheldons.

On the other hand,
I think Sheldon

might be the larval form
of his species,

and someday he'll spin a cocoon
and emerge two months later

with moth wings
and an exoskeleton.

Okay, well, thanks
for the nightmares.

Hey, do you want to
hang out with us?

What are you guys gonna do?

Uh...

My mom's making
a brisket tonight.

The one with the
little onions? Mm...

Yeah, I'm busy, so...

Good night.

Her loss. Let's go.

Brisket party!

B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K...

To-the-E-to-the-T...

 Ooh...
Don't.

Hey, aren't you
having breakfast?

Yes.

Are you experimenting with
nutritional suppositories again?

Not in these pants.

So... how'd it go with
Ramona last night?

Oh, great.

She's smart, insightful

and she has a very unique way
of, you know, revering me.

Here's your spinach mushroom
omelet .

Thank you.

Did anyone touch it?

Gloves were worn
by everyone involved.

I was vigilant.

Ramona pointed out that I've
been wasting 20 minutes a day

standing on cafeteria lines.

Time which would be
better spent

tackling the great physics
problems of our day.

You don't tackle
the big issues, Ramona.

You fence with them.

En garde. Riposte.

Touche.

Morning.

Hi, Leslie.

So, Sheldon,

I see you're
organizing your papers

for the Smithsonian Museum
of Dumbassery.

There won't be any room

until they get rid of the
permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.

Oh, good one.

I see you got a grad student
to fight your battles for you.

I'll let you keep
your lunch money today.

Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge
of a breakthrough.

If you're going to stay,

you'll have to be respectful
and quiet.

Wait for me.

So have you worked
out the neutrino issue?

Well, to paraphrase Mozart,

all the subatomic particles
are there.

I just have to put them
in the right order.

You're so witty.

Aren't I?

(knocking)

Hey, guys,
this package came for...

Dr. Cooper is working.

Yes, I'm close
to a breakthrough.

Ooh, it tickles!

Sorry.

Holy crap on a cracker.

Hey, Penny.

Hi. You probably don't want
to go in there.

Why?
What are they doing?

The only way I could explain it

would be in a therapist's office
with dolls.

Hoo-boy.

Dr. Cooper's working.

Yeah, I can see that.

Sheldon, Halo night,
Koothrappali's. You coming?

Oh, yes, it's Halo night.

Let me just dry my tootsies.

You're not going to Halo night.

Yes, I am.

It's Wednesday.
Wednesday's Halo night.

Didn't a great man once say,
"Science demands nothing less

"than the fervent and
unconditional dedication

of our entire lives"?

He did.

And who was that great man?

Me.

Sorry, Leonard.

Seriously? You're not coming?

You heard her.
How can I argue with me?

Okay, well, once again,
you guys have a good...

whatever this is.

Dr. Cooper, I have
to tell you

your friends are
holding you back.

I prefer to think of it
as "I'm pulling them forward."

Halo night?

A man with
your intellectual gifts

doesn't waste an evening
playing video games.

He does on Wednesdays.

Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.

He does want that.

Does a man with my
intellectual gifts

play paintball on weekends?

What do you think?

Drat.

Now shall we get back to work?

I suppose.

Battlestar Galactica
comes on tonight.

I guess I can wait for the DVD.

And then never ever watch it.

 You can be my Yoko Ono

 You can follow me
wherever I go 

 Be my, be my,
be my Yoko Ono, whoa-oa 

 Now that I'm far away

 It doesn't seem to me
to be such a pain 

 To have you hanging off
my ankle 

 Like some kind of ball
and chain 

 You can be my Yoko Ono

 You can follow me
wherever I go 

 You can be my Yoko Ono
 Whoa-oa-oa 

 You can follow me
wherever I go. 

(hushed):
Penny! Penny!

Penny!

Sheldon, honey,
I've told you,

it's a small apartment.

You only have to knock
one time.

Please, please, I don't have
a lot of time.

Look, Ramona finally dozed off,

and I need you to help me
get rid of her.

Get rid of her how?

I don't know,

but apparently I'm in
some kind of relationship,

and you seem to be an expert
at ending them.

Excuse me?

I see man after man leaving
this apartment never to return.

Okay, first of all,
it is not man after man.

Dr. Cooper?!
Hide me.

Hide you?

I formally request sanctuary.

Why aren't you working?

Um...

she distracted me.

I told you, Penny,
I don't have time
for your nonsense.

I have important things to do.

Oh, man.

I know what's going on here.

Really?

Well, then will you
explain it to me?

You're in love
with Dr. Cooper.

Uh, yeah, no, that's not it.

Don't try to deny it.

He's a remarkable man,

but you have
to let him go.

Oh, gee, okay.

I know it's hard, but he's
a gift to the whole world,

and we can't be selfish.

Yeah, he's a gift all right.

Sisters?

Uh, sure.

Sisters.

Holy crap on a cracker.

(rhythmic tapping on wall)

Sheldon?

(tapping stops)

(tapping resumes)

What are you doing?!

It's Morse code.

Why?

So we can communicate
through the wall.

We are communicating
through the wall.

Yes, but the communication
is not encrypted.

I don't know Morse code.

It's very simple.

This is A (taps)...

This is B (taps)...
This is C...

Sheldon, I'm not going
to learn Morse code

at 3:00 in the morning!

All right.

Don't come in here, don't come
in here, don't come in here,

don't... Oh!

(sighs)

What's going on?

Shh!
Ramona's sleeping on the couch.

I know.
When is she going home?

Never.
That's the problem.

I need your help.

What are you talking about?

I'm invoking the Skynet clause
of our friendship agreement.

That only applies if you need me

to help you destroy
an artificial intelligence

you've created that's taking
over the Earth.

Come on! Don't nitpick!

Good night.

Shh. All right.

I'm invoking our
Body Snatchers clause.

The Body Snatchers clause
requires me

to help you destroy
someone we know

who's been replaced
with an alien pod.

Yes. She's in the
living room. Go.

I'll wait here.

Sheldon, what are you doing
out of bed?

Now! Do it!

You know you need your sleep

in order for your
cognitive processing

to perform at
optimum levels.
Now come on.

Godzilla clause?

Not unless she
destroys Tokyo.

Rats.

I've got it!

I finally reconciled

the black hole
information paradox

with my theory
of string-network
condensates!

RAMONA:
It's unbelievable!

It's paradigm-altering.

And I could not have done it
without you.

Oh, please, I just offered
a little encouragement.

It was a lot more than that.

You helped me work out the
masses of all the fermions

and you pumiced my hammer toe.

How can I ever repay you?

Well, would you consider naming
it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?

Who's Nowitzki?

I'm Nowitzki.

Oh, you want me to share credit?

Uh-huh.

Get out!

Oh, hey, hi.

Oh, bite me!

Sisters?

Excuse me, Dr. Cooper.

I'm Kathy O'Brien.

I just finished reading
your paper

reconciling the black hole
information paradox

with your theory of string-
network condensates,

and it just took
my breath away.

Maybe when I publish it,
I'll include an inhaler.

Would you possibly have any time
for me to pick your brain?

Let's see. Today's Thursday.

Thursday nights, I eat pizza
from Giacomo's.

Sausage, mushrooms,
light olives.

Great.
I'll bring it to your place.

I have the address.

What a nice girl.

Sheldon, do you see
what just happened here?

Yes, I'm getting a free pizza.

More pad Thai, please.

Sheldon, you've already had
four servings.

You might want to slow down
a bit, buddy.

Just one more bite.

Sheldon?

Sheldon, are you okay?

I'm just so... full.

(gasps)

That's it. No more Thai food.






No, it's:


What's this?

That's what you did.

I assumed, as in a number of languages,
that the gesture was part of the phrase.

 Well, it's not.
 Why am I supposed to know that?

As teacher, it's your obligation
to separate your personal idiosyncrasies...

from the subject matter.

 I'm glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
 Why?

Once you're fluent, you'll have a
billion more people to annoy instead of me.

Hey.


You just called Leonard
a syphilitic donkey.

My apologies, Leonard.
I'm only as good as my teacher.

Why are you learning Chinese?

I believe the Szechuan Palace
has been passing off orange chicken...

as tangerine chicken,
and I intend to confront them.

If I were you, I'd be more concerned
about what they're passing off as chicken.

 I need to use your window.
 Oh, hey. Yeah, no, sure, go ahead.

Hey, jerk face. You forgot your iPod.

 What's going on?
 I'll tell you what's going on.

That stupid, self-centered bastard
wrote about our sex life in his blog.

Drop dead,
you stupid, self-centered bastard.

Thank you.

Okay, where were we?

Not now. I have a blog to find.

Penny, are you okay?

I'm fine, Leonard. Just go away.

I understand that breaking up
with someone can be very painful...

 Go away!
 Okay, feel better, bye.

She doesn't wanna talk.

Not surprising.

Penny's emotional responses originate in the
primitive portion of brain, the amygdala.

While speech is centered
in the recently developed neocortex.

Former can overpower the latter
giving scientific credence...

to the notion
of being rendered speechless.

Or maybe she just doesn't wanna talk.

Hey, look, I found an iPod.

It's smashed beyond repair.
What are you gonna do with it?

What else?
Sell it on eBay as slightly used.

It was Penny's boyfriend's.
They broke up.

Apparently, he posted intimate details
of their physical relationship on his blog...

which I cannot find anywhere.

You know what? I'm gonna go back
and try talking to her again.

Good idea.
Sit with her, hold her, comfort her.

And if the moment feels right,
see if you can cop a feel.

I'm not going to do that, Howard.

I'm not aware of any social convention
that requires you to intervene at all.

What about damsel in distress?

Twelfth-century code of chivalry?
Not exactly current.

You'd also have to be knighted
for that to apply.

I don't care.
She's upset, I'm going over there.

Remember to sit on your hands a bit
so they're warm.

I'm her friend. I'm not going
to take advantage of her vulnerability.

So you're saying, if in the depths of despair
she throws herself at you...

and demands you take her right there,
right now, you'll just walk away?

I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.


Hey, I know you said
you didn't wanna talk...

 I don't.
 Okay, sorry.

 Wait.
 Wait. Did you say wait?

Tell me the truth.

Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?

No, no.

Okay, so I pick good guys,
but turn them into losers?

Of course not.

Well, it's gotta be one or the other.
Which is it?

I'm sorry. What were the choices again?

I really thought Mike was different.

I thought he was sensitive and smart.

I mean, not you smart.

 Normal non-freaky smart.
 Yeah, no, sure.

You know, and then he just goes
and has to humiliate me...

by writing about me on his blog
so the entire world can read it.

Actually, it's not all that easy to find.

Yeah, really? Well, my friends at work
found it, my sister found it.

Judging by my e-mail, a number of prisoners
at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.

What exactly did this guy write?

Not that I need to know
the details of your sex life.

I just thought...

Never mind.

No, you know what?

Might as well read it,
everybody else has. Go ahead.

Oh, God, I just feel so betrayed
and embarrassed.

I just wanna crawl into a hole and die.

Okay, well, you know, this isn't that bad.

It just paints the picture
of a very affectionate woman...

who's open to expressing her affection
in nontraditional locales.

Oh, God.

Elevators, parks, movie theaters.

Out of curiosity...

is this subway, the transportation system,
or Subway, the sandwich shop?

Sandwich shop.

Doesn't that violate
the health code or...?

No, at the sub shop,
we were only making out.

Ah, okay.

But my point is that you have absolutely
no reason to be embarrassed.

Really? Do you think I overreacted?

 Maybe a little.
 Because I do that, I do overreact.

 Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.
 No, no.

No, that would be under-reacting.

He did break the implied confidentiality
of the bedroom...

and in your case, the elevator,
parks and fast-food franchise.

Yes, you're right.

I should just say I am done with him.

Yes you should. Go ahead, say it.

But I never gave the man a chance
to explain.

What is there to explain?
It's all right here.

It's betrayal.

No, you were right the first time.

This is a man who loves me...

but in his own stupid way was just trying
to show people how he feels.

I'm pretty sure I never said that.

No, you did better than that.
You helped me see it on my own.

Oh, good for me.

 Where are you going?
 I'm going over to Mike's.

 Leonard, thank you so much.
 Oh, sure.

Huh.

Maybe I am her gay friend.

Howard, I'm going
to need another Mandarin lesson.

I obviously didn't make my point
with those people.

For God's sake,
if you don't like tangerine chicken...

don't order tangerine chicken.

I like tangerine chicken.
I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.

 Can we please change the subject?
 Sure.

Tell us again how you screwed up and got
Penny back together with her old boyfriend.

Just roll the dice.

"Enslaved by warlocks.
Stay here till you roll two, four or..."

She was mad at him.

She was done with him,
the relationship was broken...

and I walked over there and I fixed it.

Boy, that story gets better
every time you hear it.

I thought the first two renditions
were far more compelling.

Previously, I felt sympathy
for the Leonard character.

Now I just find him
to be whiny and annoying.

Just eat your tangerine chicken.

I'd love to,
but I don't have tangerine chicken.

Thank you so much
for your stupid advice.

Incredible.

You managed to screw up the screw-up.


I'm back.

I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's not your fault.

What happened?

Well, I went over to Mike's
to make up with him...

Yeah, no, I know that part.

But he had already moved on.

Already? That was quick.

That's what I said to the woman
who had her legs wrapped around his neck.

Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.

How could he do that?

Oh, you know,
you did throw an 80-gig iPod...

Yeah, no, how could he do that?

I swear to God,
I am done with guys like that.

You know, macho with the perfect body,
and the hair and the money.

Yeah, that must get old quick.

You know, just once, I would like to go out
with someone who is nice and honest...

and who actually cares about me.


What about me?

What about you what?


What about if you went out with me?

Are you asking me out?

Um, yes, I am asking you out.

Wow.

I was just going off your comment
about the nice guy...

 No, I got that.
 And honest...

 Yeah, totally.
 So but...

 It's no big deal.
 Yes.

Yes, what?

Yes, I will go out with you.

Really?

Yeah.

Why not?
I mean, what do I have to lose?

Yeah.

That's the spirit.

Show me your citrus peels.


Show me your citrus peels.


 Show me...
 Sheldon?


I'm sorry.

Look, do you have a second?

A second what? Pair of underwear?

I was just wondering
if I could talk to you.

It's about Leonard.

Why me?
Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?

Well, Raj can't talk to me
unless he's drunk.

And Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.

Yes, I suppose he is.

All I'm saying
is you know Leonard the best.

Not necessarily. I'm often surprised
by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.

Just the other day, I discovered
he not only has a loofah, he hides it.

Why do you suppose a man
would be ashamed of having a loofah?

I myself prefer to have my excess
epithelial cells slough off naturally...

but I don't condemn those
who seek to accelerate the process.

And until recently, I had no idea
that despite his lactose intolerance...

he can tolerate small amounts
of nonfat ice cream...

without producing a noxious gas...

that, I maintain, in the right concentration
could be weaponized.

Leonard might come home.
Can we talk in my apartment?

We're not done?

 No.
 Eh, why not?

We're already through
the looking glass anyway.

Okay, so here's the thing.

I guess you're aware
that Leonard asked me out.

Well, he didn't actually say anything.

But when he came back to the apartment,
he was doing a dance...

that brought to mind
the happy hippos in Fantasia.

Oh, that's nice.

Anyhow,
the thing I wanted to talk to about is...

you know, since Leonard
and I have become friends, I was just...

Wanna sit down?

Oh, I wish it were that simple.

You see, I don't spend much time here,
and so I've never chosen a place to sit.

Well, choose.

There are a number of options and...

I'm really not familiar enough
with the cushion densities...

air-flow patterns and dispersion
of sunlight to make an informed choice.

Why don't you pick at random, if you
don't like it, sit somewhere else next time?

No, no, that's crazy.

You go ahead and talk
while I figure it out.

Okay.

Here's the thing.

So I've known for a while now
that Leonard has had a little crush on me...

A little crush?

Well, I suppose so.

In the same way Menelaus
had a little crush on Helen of Troy.

I don't really know who they are...

 Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon...
 Yeah, I don't care. Listen.

The point is...

Leonard isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

Leonard isn't the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

Would you be open
to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

No. What I'm saying is,
Leonard might be different in a good way.

And obviously, my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

Your last one worked out well
for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod.

Oh, glare.

But on the other hand...

if things don't go well with Leonard,
I risk losing a really good friend.

I mean, he's not looking for a fling.

He's the kind that gets into a relationship
for, like you would say, light-years.

I would not say that.

No one would say that.
A light-year is a unit of distance, not time.

Thank you for the clarification.

Draft.

You see, people hear the word "year"
and they think duration.

Foot-pound has the same problem.
That's a unit of work, not of weight.

Right. Thanks.

 It's a common mistake.
 Not the first one I've made today.

Okay.

I think this will be my seat.

Do you have anything to say
that has anything to do...

with, you know,
what I'm talking about?

Well, let's see.

We might consider Schrödinger's cat.

Schrödinger. Is that the woman in 2A?

No, that's Mrs. Grossinger.

She doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican
hairless. Annoying little animal. Yip-yip-yip.

Sheldon.

Sorry, you diverted me.

Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrödinger,
in an attempt to explain...

the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
physics, he proposed an experiment.

A cat is placed in a box
with a sealed vial of poison...

that will break open at a random time.

Now, since no one knows
when or if the poison has been released...

until the box is opened, the cat
can be thought of as both alive and dead.

I'm sorry, I don't get the point.

Well, of course you don't get it.
I haven't made it yet.

You have to be psychic,
there's no such thing...

Sheldon, what's the point?

Just like Schrödinger's cat,
your potential relationship with Leonard...

right now
can be thought of as both good and bad.

It is only by opening the box
that you'll find out which it is.

Okay, so you're saying
I should go out with Leonard?

No, no, no.

Let me start again.
In 1935, Erwin Schrödinger...

Two seats right there.


Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.

I can see that.
Unless you're running a marathon...

choosing both stuffing and mashed
potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy.

No, it's about Penny.

A mistake involving Penny.

Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.

I don't think
I can go out with her tonight.

Then don't.

Other people would say, "Why not?"

Other people might be interested.

 I'm gonna talk anyway.
 I assumed you would.

Now that I'm actually about to go out
with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.

Then your meal choice is appropriate.

Starch absorbs fluid...

which reduces the amount
of vomit available for violent expulsion.

 Right.
 You also made a grammatical mistake.

You said "nauseous"
when you meant "nauseated."

But go on.

Sheldon, this date
is probably my one chance with Penny.

What happens if I blow it?

Well, if we accept your premise and also
accept the highly improbable assumption...

that Penny is the only woman
in the world for you...

we can logically conclude
that the result of blowing it...

would be that you end up a lonely,
bitter old man with no progeny.

The image of any number
of evil lighthouse keepers...

from Scooby-Doo cartoons
comes to mind.

You're not helping.

All right, what response on my part...

would bring this conversation
to a conclusion?

Tell me whether or not
to go through with the date.

Schrödinger's cat.

Wow, that's brilliant.

You sound surprised.

Mmm.


 Hi.
 Hi.

 Come on in.
 Thank you.

You look very nice.

Thank you. So do you.


I made an 8:00 reservation.

Okay, yeah, great. Listen...

Maybe we should talk first.

Oh.

Okay.

But before you say anything,
have you ever heard of Schrödinger's cat?

Actually, I've heard
far too much about Schrödinger's cat.

Good.

All right, the cat's alive.
Let's go to dinner.


Crazy man. Call the police.


Phew!



Watch this, it's really cool. Ahem.

Call Leonard Hofstadter.

Did you say, "Call Helen Boxleitner"?

No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.

Did you say, "Call Temple Beth Seder"?

 No.
 Here, let me try.

Call M'kflono M'kflooniloo. Ha-ha. Ha.

Calling Rajesh Koothrappali.


Oh. It's very impressive.

And a little racist.

If we're through playing
Mock the Flawed Technology...

can we get on with "Halo" night?

We were supposed to start at 8.
It's now 8:06.

So we'll start now.

We have to decide
if those lost six minutes...

will come out of game time,
bathroom time or the pizza break.

We could split it two, two and two.

If we're having anchovies on the pizza,
we can't take it out of bathroom time.


What fresh hell is this?

 Hey, Penny. Come on in.
 Hey, guys.

See a Penny, pick her up,
and all the day, you'll have good luck.

No, you won't. Uh...

 Can I hide out here for a while?
 Sure. What's going on?

Well, there's this girl I know
from back in Nebraska, Christy.

She called me up,
she's like, "Hey, how's California?"

And I'm like, "Awesome,"
because it's not Nebraska.

The next thing I know,
she's invited herself to stay with me.

 Eight oh eight.
 Shh.

She got here today
and she's just been in my apartment...

yakking about every guy she slept with
in Omaha, which is every guy in Omaha...

and washing
the sluttiest collection of underwear...

you have ever seen
in my bathroom sink.

Is she doing it one thong at a time
or does she throw it all in?

Like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?

 He really needs to dial it down.
 I know.

So if you don't like this Christy,
why are you letting her stay?

She was engaged to my cousin
while sleeping with my brother...

so she's kind of family.

Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst.

Who needs "Halo"
when we can be regaled...

with the delightfully folksy tale
of the whore of Omaha?

Oh... I don't think she's a whore.

No, yeah, she's definitely a whore.

I mean, she has absolutely no standards.

This one time, she was at...

Where's Howard?

Bonjour, mademoiselle.

I understand you're new in town.

Oh, good grief.


Ugh. I cannot believe Christy let Howard
into my apartment.

And I cannot believe people pay
for horoscopes...

but on a more serious note,
it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo."

Okay, fine. We'll just play one-on-one
until he gets back.

One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one.

We play teams, not one-on-one.
One-on-one.

Well, the only way we can play teams
at this point is if we cut Raj in half.

Sure, cut the foreigner in half.
There's a billion more where he came from.

Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.

 Great idea.
 Uh, no.

The wheel was a great idea.
Relativity was a great idea.

This is a notion,
and a rather sucky one at that.

 Why?
 Why? Oh...

 Penny, Penny, Penny.
 What, what, what?

This is a complex battle simulation
with a steep learning curve.

There are myriad weapons,
vehicles and strategies to master...

not to mention an intricate back-story.


Oh, cool!
Whose head did I just blow off?

Mine.

Okay, I got this. Lock and load, boys.

It's the only way we can play teams.

Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung
by her lack of experience, not to mention...


Ha-ha! There goes your head again.

Okay, it's not good sportsmanship
to shoot somebody who's just re-spawned.

You need to give them a chance to...
Now, come on.


Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered.
Cover me.

Cover this, suckers.


Penny, you are on fire.

Yeah, and so is Sheldon.


Okay, that's it.
I don't know how, but she is cheating.

No one can be that attractive
and this skilled at a video game.

Wait, Sheldon, come back.
You forgot something.

What?

This plasma grenade.


Ha! Look, it's raining you.

You laugh now,
you just wait until you need tech support.

Gosh. He's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?

Well, to be fair,
he's also a rather unpleasant winner.

Well, it's been fun.

Penny, we make such a good team.

Maybe we could enter
a couple of "Halo" tournaments sometime.

Or we could just have a life.

I guess for you, that's an option.
Ha-ha. Ha.

 Good night, Leonard.
 Good night.

As usual, nice talking to you, Raj.

What do you suppose she meant by that?

She's an enigma, Raj.

There's a certain ethic to the game,
Penny, a well-established...

She's gone, Sheldon.

Well, she could have said goodbye.

Okay, I have a problem.

It's called carpal tunnel syndrome,
and quite frankly, you deserve it.

What's wrong?

Well, um, Howard and Christy
are kind of hooking up in my bedroom.

 Are you sure?
 Look, I grew up on a farm, okay?

From what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.

Do you mind if I stay here tonight?

No. Yeah, take the couch, or my bed.
I just got new pillows.

Hypoallergenic.

Uh, the couch is good.

Hold that thought. Leonard, a moment.

You have a problem with this.

Where do I begin?

It's up to you. Crazy person's choice.

Well, first, we don't have house guests.

Frankly, if I could afford the rent,
I'd ask you to leave.

Your friendship means a lot
to me as well. What else?

Well, our earthquake supplies.

 We have a two-man, two-day kit.
 So?

So if there's an earthquake
and the three of us are trapped here...

we could be out of food
by tomorrow afternoon.

Are you suggesting
that if we let Penny stay...

we might succumb to cannibalism?

No one ever thinks it'll happen
until it does.

Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh
off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.

 Ha. What?
 He's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.

It's the fallacy of extending someone's
argument to ridiculous proportions...

and then criticizing the result.
And I don't appreciate it.

I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.

Okay, since I'm obviously being ignored
here, let's go over the morning schedule.

I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20.

Plan your ablutions
and bodily functions accordingly.

How am I supposed to
plan my bodily functions?

I suggest no liquids after 11p.m.

 Here you go.
 Thanks, Leonard.

Heh, wrong.

I'm listening.

Your head goes on the other end.

 Why?
 It's culturally universal.

A bed, even a temporary bed...

is always oriented with the headboard
away from the door.

It serves the ancient imperative
of protecting oneself against marauders.

 I'll risk it.
 Ooh.

Anything else I should know?

Yes. If you use my toothbrush,
I'll jump out that window.

Please don't come to my funeral.
Have a good night.

 Sorry about that.
 That's okay.

FYI, his toothbrush is the red one
in the Plexiglas case under the UV light.

 Ha. Got it.
 Well, sleep tight.

Thanks.

Funny expression, sleep tight. Ha-ha. Ha.

It refers to
the early construction of beds...

which featured a mattress suspended
on interlocking ropes, which occasionally...

Sleep tight.

What are you doing?

Every Saturday since we've lived in
this apartment I have awakened at 6:15...

poured a bowl of cereal,
added a quarter cup of milk...

sat on this end of this couch, turned on
BBC America, and watched Doctor Who.

Penny's still sleeping.

Every Saturday
since we've lived in this apartment...

I have awakened at 6:15,
poured myself...

I know.
Look, you have a TV in your room.

Why don't you have breakfast in bed?

Because I am neither an invalid
nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.

What time is it?

Almost 6:30.

I slept all day?

No, it's 6:30 in the morning.

What the hell is your problem?

Okay, this cereal
has lost all its molecular integrity.

I now have a bowl
of shredded wheat paste.

Hola, nerd-migos.

Why do you people hate sleep?

Are you wearing my robe?

Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'll have it cleaned.

That's okay, keep it.

 Where's Christy?
 In the shower.

By the way,
where did you get that loofah mitt?

Yours reaches places
that mine just won't.

You used my loofah?

More precisely, we used your loofah.

I exfoliated her brains out.

You can keep that too.

Ah. Well, then, we'll probably need to talk
about your stuffed-bear collection.

 In here, milady.

Mm. There's my little engine that could.


There's one beloved children's book
I'll never read again.

Hi. Christy.

 Hey, Leonard.
 I'm Sheldon.

Right. You're Howard's entourage.

So, Christy, what are your plans?

Well, Howard said he'd take me shopping
in Beverly Hills.

Yeah, no, I meant plans to find
someplace to live other than with me.

Not that I don't love having you,
but it's a little crowded.

Penny, you're always welcome
to stay with us.

Oh, terrific.
Now we're running a cute little B & B.

Let me offer a little thinking here.

 Why doesn't Christy stay with me?
 You live with your mother.

I do not. My mother lives with me.

It's settled. Christy will stay with Howard,
Penny can go back to her apartment.

And I'll watch the last 24 minutes
of Doctor Who...

although at this point,
it's more like Doctor Why Bother?

 Sheldon, you just can't dictate...
 No more talking. Everybody go.

So, what do you say?
Wanna repair to Casa Wolowitz?

What is that, like a Mexican deli?

I'm sorry,
I should have mentioned this earlier.

My last name is Wolowitz.

Oh. That's so cool.

My first Jew.

I imagine there aren't
very many kosher cornhuskers.

 But you're still taking me shopping?
 Anything you want.

Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.

When they perfect human cloning,
I'm gonna order 12 of those.

Howard, can't you see she's using you?

Who cares? Last night,
she pulled off her blouse and I wept.

Look, Howard, I know her, okay?

She'll have sex with anyone
as long as they keep buying her things.

 Really?
 Yeah.

Yay.

If you'll excuse me,
I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.

I'm sorry,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

We can't order Chinese food
without Wolowitz?

Let me walk you through it.

Our standard order is,
the steamed dumpling appetizer...

General Tso's chicken,
beef with broccoli...

shrimp with lobster sauce,
and vegetable lo mein.

Do you see the problem?

I see a problem.

Our entire order is predicated
on four dumplings and four entrées...

divided amongst four people.

So we'll just order three entrées.

Fine. What do you wanna eliminate?

 And who gets the extra dumpling?
 We could cut it into thirds.

Then it's no longer a dumpling.

Once you cut it open, it is, at best,
a very small open-faced sandwich.

Hi, fellas.

Oh. Where's your annoying little friend
who thinks he speaks Mandarin?

He's putting his needs
ahead of the collective good.

Where he comes from,
that's punishable by death.

I come from Sacramento.

Can we get an order of dumplings,
but with three instead of four?

No substitutions.

This isn't a substitution.
It's a reduction.

Okay. No reductions.

Fine. Bring us three orders of dumplings.

 That's 12, we'll each have four.
 That works.

If we fill up on dumplings,
we need to eliminate an entrée.

No eliminations.

If we have extra,
we'll just take the leftovers home.

And divide it how? I'm telling you,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

Wolowitz is with his girlfriend.

If you'd let me invite Penny,
you would've had your fourth.

Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food?

She uses a fork
and she double-dips her egg rolls.

 We don't order egg rolls.
 Exactly. But we'd have to if she was here.

Can we please make a decision?

Not only are there children starving in
India, there's an Indian starving right here.

There's an idea.
Why don't we go out for Indian food?

Oh, ew.

You're nice boys.

Tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna bring you the four dumplings.

When I'm walking over to the table...

maybe I get bumped,
one of the dumplings fall to the floor.

No one has to know.

I'll know.


 How about soup?
 Yeah, we can always divide soup.

What about the won tons?

Oh. Hey, guys, what's up?

It's "Halo" night.

Yeah? Okay.

So?

With Wolowitz spending all of his time
with your friend Christy...

She's not my friend. Friends do not
get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.

Right, anyway, uh,
with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere...

we had something
we wanted to ask you.

 Sheldon?
 Yes. Ahem.

Penny,
we would very much appreciate it...

if you would be the fourth member
of our "Halo" team.

I don't think I need to tell you
what an honor this is.

Oh. That's so sweet.

But I'm going out dancing
with a girlfriend.

You can't go out, it's "Halo" night.

Well, for Penny, it's dancing night.

 You go dancing every Wednesday?
 No.

Then it's not dancing night.

Why don't I play with you tomorrow?

Tonight is "Halo" night.
It's like talking to a wall.

All right, now, Sheldon,
you and I are about to have a problem.

Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.

Yes, but you didn't portray her
as completely irrational.

All right, fellas, I gotta go.

But good luck.

Maybe we should've asked if we could go
dancing with her and her girlfriend.

Okay, assuming we could dance,
which we can't...

there are three of us and two of them.

 So?
 It's the Chinese restaurant all over again.

I assure you that cutting
a dumpling in thirds is child's play...

compared with three men each attempting
to dance with 67 percent of a woman.

For God's sakes, Sheldon,
you are driving me crazy.

Your anger is not with me,
but with mathematics.

I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.

What is happening to us?
We're falling apart.

 Who are you calling?
 The only man who can restore...

any semblance of balance
to our universe.

This is Howard.

This is Christy.

right now because we're having sex.

on your message, are you?

I'm just kidding. I'll re-record it.


Sheldon, think this through.

You're going to ask Howard
to choose between sex and "Halo."

No, I'm going to ask him
to choose between sex and "Halo 3."

As far as I know,
sex has not been upgraded...

to include hi-def graphics
and enhanced weapon systems.

You're right, all sex has is nudity,
orgasms and human contact.

My point.

damn plastic off the couch once in a while.

and Howard can hump on it?

I'm sure there's a middle ground.


I'm gonna take my scooter out for a spin.

You drove your son out of the house.

Why don't you stop butting in?

 What are you guys doing here?
 It's "Halo" night.

He's not a man, he's a putz.

And don't you take that tone with me,
you gold digger.


You're barking up the wrong tree...

because as long as you're around,
Howard is out of the will.

I got better offers. I'm out of here.

Go back to Babylon, you whore.

So "Halo" night, huh?

 I thought she was the whore of Omaha.
 Shh.


Sheldon, you got him in your sights. Fire!
He's charging his plasma rifle.

 I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.
 Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.

I can't see him.

That's why they call it cloaking,
dead man.

 Start throwing grenades.
 I'm all out.

Hey, guys, my friends and I
got tired of dancing...

so we came over to have sex
with you.

Now, Raj, jump in the tank.

 We said no tanks.
 There are no rules in hell.

Son of a bitch.
Med-pack! I need a med-pack!

Told you.

There's a sniper.
Use your rocket launcher.

All I've got is a needler
and I'm all out of ammo!

And now you're out of life.


 Why did you hit pause?
 I thought I heard something.

 What?
 No... Never mind.

Sorry, go.



No, see, the liquid-metal terminators
were created in the future by Skynet...

and Skynet was developed
by Miles Dyson...

but that future no longer exists
due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.

Okay, then riddle me this.

Assuming all the good terminators...

were originally evil terminators
created by Skynet...

then reprogrammed by the future
John Connor, why would Skynet...

an artificial computer intelligence...

bother to create
a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot?

Skynet is kinky? I don't know.

Artificial intelligences
do not have teen fetishes.

 All right, wait. They use it to lure...
 Eh! Too late, I win.


Let's go out tonight

I have to go out tonight

What the hell is that?

I don't know. But if cats could sing...

they'd hate it too.

You wanna prowl

Be my night owl?
Well, take my...

Hey, guys.

 Hi, where are you going?
 What?

We just had to mail some letters.

And throw away some chicken.

You'll never guess what just happened.

 I give up.
 I don't guess.

As a scientist, I reach conclusions
based on observation and experimentation.

Although it occurs to me, you may
have been employing a rhetorical device...

rendering my response moot.

 What was that?
 Believe it or not, personal growth.

What happened?

Remember when I auditioned for Rent but
I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?

I have a conclusion
based on an observation.

No, you don't.

No, he doesn't.

The girl picked to play Mimi, she dropped
out and they asked me to replace her.

 Oh! Congratulations, what a lucky break.
 It's not a big deal.

Just one night,
but they invite casting people and agents.

So you never know.

 I think I know.
 No, you don't.

 He doesn't.
 It's this Friday at 8, you guys wanna come?

 No.
 No.

Because Friday,
we are attending a symposium...

on molecular positronium.

 I think that's a week from Tuesday at 6.
 No, it's this Friday.

 At 8.
 Oh, too bad.

 I gotta get to rehearsal. See you guys.
 See you.

Let's go out tonight

 You just lied to Penny.
 Yes, I did.

And you did it so casually.

No rapid breathing,
no increase in perspiration.

 So?
 So lack of a physiological response...

while lying
is characteristic of a violent sociopath.

Sheldon, are you worried
about your safety?

No. I imagine if you were going to kill me,
you'd have done it a long time ago.

That's very true.

Leonard?

Leonard?

 Leonard?

I need to speak to you.

 It's 2:00 in the morning.
 It's important.

I highly doubt that.

Go away.

Are you still out there?

Yes.

What?

You're right, it can wait until morning.

 Never mind.

I clearly woke you up
in the middle of a REM cycle.

 You're in no state of mind to talk.
 Sheldon, what is it?

I'm uncomfortable
having been included in your lie to Penny.

 What was I supposed to say?
 You could have told her the truth.

That would have hurt her feelings.

Is that a relevant factor?

Yes.

Then I suppose
you could have agreed to go.

And what would I have said afterwards?

I would suggest something
to the effect of:

"Singing is neither an appropriate vocation
nor avocation for you...

and if you disagree, I recommend
a CAT scan to look for a tumor...

pressing on the cognitive
processing centers of your brain."

I couldn't say that.

I would have to say, "You were terrific
and I can't wait to hear you sing again."

Why?

It's the social protocol.

It's what you do...

when you have a friend who's proud
of something they really suck at.

I was not aware of that.

 Well, now you are.
 Oh, all right.

 Leonard?
 Yes?

When we played chess earlier, you were
terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.

Good night.


Leonard? Leonard?

Leonard? Leonard?

This would be so much easier
if I were a violent sociopath.

Leonard? Leonard?

 What?
 I was analyzing our lie...

and I believe we're in danger
of Penny seeing through the ruse.

 How?
 Simple.

If she were to log on to www.
socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other...

click on upcoming events, scroll to
seminars, download the PDF schedule...

and look for the seminar
on molecular positronium, then...

bippity boppity boo,
our pants are metaphorically on fire.

Well, sir, my trousers
will not be igniting today.

Penny?

Penny?

Penny?

Good morning.

 Do you have any idea what time it is?
 Of course I do.

My watch is linked to the atomic clock
in Boulder, Colorado.

It's accurate to one-tenth of a second.

As I'm saying this
it occurs to me once again...

your question may
have been rhetorical.

What do you want?

Remember how Leonard told you
we couldn't come...

because we were attending a symposium
on molecular positronium?

I remember symposium.

Yes, well, he lied.

Wait, what?

He lied, and I'm feeling
very uncomfortable about it.

Well, imagine how I'm feeling.

Hungry?

Tired?

I'm sorry, this really isn't my strong suit.

You told her I lied?

Why would you tell her I lied?

To help you.

I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.

She was going to see
through your lie eventually...

so I told her that you were lying
to protect me.


Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.

Hunger?

Indigestion?

I'm sorry,
I'm really not very good at this.

Anyway, Penny now believes
that on Friday night...

we're going to participate
in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.

Your cousin Leopold.

Whom most people call Leo,
but he also answers to Lee.

Remember that, it's important.

 What's important?
 Details, Leonard.

The success or failure
of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.

 Do you have a cousin Leopold?
 No, I made him up.

I think you'd call him Lee.

I don't get it. I already told her a lie,
why replace it with a different lie?

Well, first of all,
your lie was laughably transparent...

where mine is exquisitely convoluted.

While you were sleeping,
I was weaving an un-unravelable web.

 Un-unravelable?
 Yes.

If she Googles Leopold Houston,
she'll find a Facebook page...

an online blog
depicting his descent into drug use...

and a desperate
yet hopeful listing on eHarmony.com.

Okay, why would I go
to a drug intervention for your cousin?

Ah! Because it's in Long Beach
and I don't drive.

We're going to Long Beach?

Of course not, there's no cousin Leo,
there's no intervention.

 Focus, Leonard.
 Oh, come on.

We just leave the house on Friday night
and return in the wee hours...

emotionally wrung out from the work
of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.

So he goes back into rehab?

Yes, but he can relapse if Penny
ever invites us to hear her sing again.

You still told her I lied.

Yeah, for a noble purpose.

To spare me the social embarrassment
of having a drug-addled first cousin.

 Which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
 I don't know.

 How am I supposed to remember all this?
 That's the best part, you don't have to.

I told Penny that you would be embarrassed
if you knew she found out you had lied...

so she's agreed to operate
as if the original lie is still in force.

So she's expecting me to lie
about going to a symposium in Pasadena...

when in actuality, we're pretending to go
to a drug intervention in Long Beach.

Un-unravelable.

Oh, hey, Penny. Wow, look at you,
all ready for your showcase.

 You look great.

I just wanted to come by and wish you
guys luck with your symposium.

Oh.

 Well, thank you.
 You know, I gotta tell you.

A lot of friends would let their friend
go alone, but that's not you.

You are the kind of guy
who stands by a friend when...

When he has a symposium to go to.

I don't know what to say.

 It's okay, Leonard.
 Oh, okay, all right, good.

 Oh, boy, group hug.
 Uh-uh.

 Uh-uh?
 Okay. So, what's up?

Well, Penny is on her way to perform in
a one-night showcase production of Rent...

which we are unable to attend,
because we're going to a symposium...

on molecular positronium
given by Dr. Emil Farmanfarmian.

Wait a minute, Farmanfarmian is speaking
and you're bogarting the symposium?

 Howard, I'm sorry, we would've...
 No, no, you're quark-blocking us.

I don't know what to say.

Wow.

 Howard...
 It's your Millennium Falcon...

you and Chewbacca do
whatever you wanna do.

Me and Princess Leia here will find
some other way to spend the evening.

Howard, wait.

Sheldon, I think we should tell them.

Okay, sure.

I don't see a problem with that.

There's no symposium.

Leonard lied to me.
Isn't that right, Leonard?

Well...

 I don't know what to say.
 It's okay, I do.

Look, Leonard is helping Sheldon
through a family crisis.

He made up the whole story about
the symposium with Dr. Farmanfarmian...

 Good for you.
 Ha! Yeah.

He didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

Every family in America has a relative...

holed up in a garage somewhere
huffing paint thinner.

No, I'm lost too.
I think she skipped a step.

Now, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped
rehab and he's in a Motel 8 in Long Beach.

The whole family's going out
for an intervention.

Leonard is driving Sheldon down
to help him through this...

 ...because he's such a good man.
 Oh, another hug? Thank you.

 All right, you guys. Good luck.
 Thanks, Penny.

 Break a leg.
 Yeah, break a leg.

So road trip to Long Beach.

 We're not going to Long Beach.
 Why not?

Because Sheldon doesn't have
a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.

Oh, too bad.

I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.

It's a very nice community.
The Queen Mary is docked there.

Once the largest liner in the world,
it's now a hotel and restaurant...

where they host a surprisingly gripping
murder-mystery dinner.

 Sounds fun.
 I'm game.

 Shotgun.
 No, no, no.

Leonard gets nauseous unless
he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.

Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?


Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?

Let it go, Sheldon.

The murderer was the first mate
whether it makes sense to you or not.

No, that's the least of our worries.

I've been doing research on addiction...

both the biochemical
and behavioral aspects...

and I think there's a problem
with the current version of our lie.

What are you talking about?
It's fine, she bought it, it's over.

Sadly, it's not.

Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle.

But beyond that,
I have realized the Leo I described...

 ...would not have agreed to go to rehab.
 Why not?

Because Leo's a middle child.

There's no Leo. How can you say that?

You didn't read the bio, did you?

He's not just a middle child,
he is the quintessential middle child.

From a broken home, to boot.
Psychologically speaking...

the attention he gets by rebelling,
even to the point of destruction...

is more emotionally valuable
than help he would get at rehab.

 I've got a solution.
 Great. What is it?

Get out.

Fine.

I've hesitated to point this out...

but I must remind you
we are in our predicament...

because of your initial
and inadequate deceit.

I'm just trying to clean up
after your mess.

We'll talk in the morning.

Morning.

Who are you?

I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.

Oh, God.

Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.

Au contraire.

I'm 26 years old...

I'm originally from "Denton, Texas,"
but I was a Navy brat.

I was brought up on a variety
of military bases around the world.

As a result, I've often felt like an outsider,
never really fitting in...

probably the reason
for my substance-abuse problem.

Excuse me, we just went over this.

As the middle child, your addiction
is rooted in your unmet need for attention.

Oh, Sheldon, are we really gonna go
with pop psychology?

For your information,
this is all based on solid research.

Just stick with the character profile
I wrote for you.

 Sheldon?
 I'm sorry.

Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld.

He's a research assistant
in the particle-physics lab...

but he also minored in theater at MIT.

It was more of a double major, actually.

Theater and Physics.

You can guess which one
my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.

Yeah, I got it.

Sheldon, why?

You see, while Leo would not
have gone into rehab...

it is completely plausible that we would
have talked him into leaving the motel...

 ...and coming home with us.
 Oh...

Sheldon, how about this
as my motivation?

When I was 14 years old...

I was abused in the Philippines
by a clubfooted Navy chaplain.

No, we're going with middle child
and a genetic predisposition...

to inadequate serotonin production.

Swell, well, how do I play
genetic predisposition?

Subtextually, of course.


Just have fun with it.

 Morning, Penny.
 Hi. How did the intervention go?

Unfortunately, we weren't able
to convince him to go to rehab.

Well, based on what you told me,
I'm not surprised.

But we did convince him
to leave the motel.

Come say hello.

Leo, this is Penny,
our friend and neighbor.

Hi, Leo, how are you feeling?

Let me ask you something, Penny.

Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel
covered in your own vomit...

next to a transsexual prostitute?

 No.
 Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.

Well, that's Leo.

Hey, why don't you tell me
about your showcase last night?

Oh, it was okay, I guess.

Wasn't a big turnout,
but they both seemed to like it.

 There were only two people there?
 By the end, yeah.

Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan.

I'm sorry?

The Philippines.

1992.

The Subic Bay Naval Station.

A young boy on the cusp of manhood.

His only companions,
mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes.

Desperate and alone,
he reached out to a man...

who promised to introduce him
to a merciful, loving God...

but who instead introduced him
to a gin-pickled tongue...

shoved down his adolescent throat.

What choice did he have...

but to drink, shoot
and snort his pain away?

Don't forget genetic predisposition
towards addiction.

Never been proven.

 There have been studies.
 Not double-blind studies.

How could there be?
Who would be the control group?

As you can see,
detoxing can get pretty ugly.

 Let's give them some privacy.
 Yeah.

Do you wanna come over,
have coffee?

 Sounds good.
 I have a video of me singing last night.

Do you wanna see it?

 Gee, why wouldn't I?
 This is even better...

than you coming to the showcase,
now I get to watch you watch me.

Yeah.

Funny how things work out.

But he loved the companionship
and the wisdom...

that his own father failed to provide.

Your parents made the right decision.

I cannot work like this.


This is amazing, just sitting on a couch
watching TV with a woman.

Not being drunk or high
or wondering if you're a dude down there.

Leo, you are a very sweet,
really funny guy.

You're gonna do okay.

One day at a time, Penny.

One day at a time.

How long is he going to stay here?

He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard,
where is he going to go?

Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.



Here you go. Pad Thai, no peanuts.

Does it have peanut oil?

I'm not sure.

Everyone keep an eye on Howard
in case he starts to swell up.

Since it's not bee season,
you can have my epinephrine.

 Any chopsticks?
 Don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.

Here we go.

Thailand has had the fork
since the latter half of the 19th century.

They don't put the fork in their mouth,
they use it to put the food on a spoon...

which then goes into their mouth.

Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.


I'll get it.

Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

 Hey, Leonard.
 Oh, hi, Penny.

 Am I interrupting?
 No.

You're not swelling, Howard.

they're like Vienna sausages.

 Sounds like you have company.
 They're not going anywhere.

So you're coming home from work.
That's great. How was work?

You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory...

people order cheesecake
and I bring it to them.

So you kind of act
as like a carbohydrate delivery system?

Yeah, call it whatever you want,
I get minimum wage.

Yeah.

I was wondering
if you could help me out...

 Yes.
 Oh.

Okay, great, I'm having
some furniture delivered...

and I may not be here, so, oh...

Hello.


I'm sorry?

Haven't you ever been told
how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?

 No, I haven't.
 Get used to it.

Yeah, I probably won't.

 Hey, Sheldon.
 Hi.

Hey, Raj.

Still not talking to me, huh?

Don't take it personally,
it's his pathology.

 He can't talk to women.
 He can't talk to attractive women.

Or in your case,
a cheesecake-scented goddess.

 There's gonna be some furniture delivered?
 Yeah.

If it gets here and I'm not here,
could you sign for it and put it in?

 Yeah, no problem.
 Great, here's my spare key.

Thank you.

 Penny, wait.
 Yeah?

Um...

If you don't have any other plans...

do you wanna join us for Thai food
and a Superman movie marathon?

A marathon? Wow, how many
Superman movies are there?

You're kidding, right?

I do like the one where
Lois Lane falls from the helicopter...

and Superman catches her.

 Which one was that?
 One.

You realize that scene was rife
with scientific inaccuracy?

Yes, I know, men can't fly.

No, let's assume that they can.

Lois Lane is falling.

Accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second.

Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.

Miss Lane, who is now traveling...

at approximately
120 miles an hour, hits them...

and is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.

Unless Superman
matches her speed and decelerates.

In what space, sir? In what space?

She's 2 feet above the ground.

If he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.

 It would be a more merciful death.
 That doesn't...

Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption...

that Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.

Are you listening to yourself?

Superman's flight is a feat of strength.

An extension of his ability
to leap buildings...

an ability he derives
from exposure to sun...

How does he fly at night?

A combination
of the moon's solar reflection...

and the energy storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.

I'm just gonna go wash up.

I have 2600 comic books in there.

I challenge you to find a single reference
to Kryptonian skin cells.

Challenge accepted.

We're locked out.

Also, the pretty girl left.

Okay.

Her apartment's on the fourth floor,
elevator is broken, you're gonna...

Oh, you're just gonna be done?
Okay, cool, thanks.

 I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
 I hardly think so.

Why not?

Well, we don't have a dolly...

or lifting belts,
or any measurable upper-body strength.

We don't need strength.
We're physicists.

We are the intellectual
descendents of Archimedes.

Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the Earth.

It's just a matter... I don't have this!
I do not have this!

Archimedes would be so proud.

Do you have any ideas?

Yes, but they all involve
a Green Lantern and a power ring.

Easy. Easy.

Okay. Now we've got an inclined plane.

Force required to lift is reduced
by the sine of the angle of the stairs...

call it 30 degrees, so about half.

Exactly half.

Let's push.

Okay.

See, it's moving. This is easy.

It's all in the math.

 What's your formula for the corner?
 What?

Oh, okay.

Okay, yeah, no problem.
Just come up here, help me pull and turn.

Oh, gravity, thou art a heatless bitch.

You do understand
that our efforts here...

will in no way increase the odds of you
having sexual congress with this woman?

Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

Yeah, those would be men
who just had sex.

I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.

In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

Almost there.

 Almost there.

 No, we're not. No, we're not.
 I'm sorry.

 Watch your fingers.
 Yeah.

Oh, God, my fingers!

 You okay?
 No, it hurt...

Great Caesar's ghost, look at this place.

So Penny is a little messy.

A little messy?

The Mandelbrot set
of complex numbers is a little messy.

This is chaos.

Excuse me.

Explain to me a system...

where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid?

I'm just inferring that this is a couch...

because the evidence suggests
the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.

Did it occur to you that not everyone
has the compulsive need to sort...

organize and label
the entire world around them?

No.

Well, they don't.

Hard as it may be to believe...

most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

Excuse me, but I think
we've both found that helpful at times.

 Come on, we should go.
 Hang on.

 What are you doing?
 I'm straightening up.

Sheldon, this is not your home.

This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

Because it was immaculate.

I mean, you open that man's closet...

it was left to right, evening gowns,
cocktail dresses and his police uniforms.

 What were you doing in his closet?
 I helped him run some cable for a webcam.

 Hey, guys.
 Oh, hey, Penny.

This just arrived.
Brought this up. Just now.

Great. Was it hard getting up the stairs?

 No.
 No?

 No.
 No.

 We'll get out of your hair.
 Okay, great.

Thank you again.

Penny?

I just want you to know
that you don't have to live like this.

I'm here for you.

What's he talking about?

 It's a joke.
 I don't get it.

Yeah, he didn't tell it right.


Sheldon?

Hello?

 Shh!

Penny's sleeping.

Are you insane?

You can't break into a woman's apartment
in the middle of the night and clean.

I had no choice.

I couldn't sleep knowing that just
outside my bedroom was our living room...

and outside our living room
was that hallway...

and immediately adjacent
to that hallway was this.

Do you realize that if Penny wakes up...

there is no reasonable explanation
as to why we're here?

I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

No, no. You gave me an explanation.

It's reasonableness will be determined
by a jury of your peers.

Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.

Sheldon, we have to get out of here.


You might want to speak
in a lower register.

What?

Evolution has made women sensitive
to high-pitch noises while they sleep...

so that they'll be roused
by a crying baby.

If you want to avoid waking her,
speak in a lower register.

That's ridiculous!


No, that's ridiculous.

Fine.

I accept your premise.
Now, please let's go.

 I'm not leaving until I'm done.
 Oh, no.

If you have time to lean,
you have time to clean.

Oh, what the hell.


Good morning.

Morning.

I have to say I slept splendidly.

Granted not long,
but just deeply and well.

I'm not surprised.

A well-known folk cure for insomnia...

is to break
into your neighbor's apartment and clean.

Sarcasm?

You think?

Granted, my methods
may have been somewhat unorthodox...

but the end result
will be a measurable enhancement...

to Penny's quality of life.

You've convinced me, maybe we should
sneak in and shampoo her carpet.

 You don't think that crosses a line?
 Yes.

For God's sake, Sheldon...

do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?

You have a sarcasm sign?

No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.

You want some cereal?

I feel so good today, I'm gonna choose
from the low-fiber end of the shelf.

Hello, Honey Puffs.

Son of a bitch!

Penny's up.

You sick, geeky bastards!

How did she know it was us?

I may have left
a suggested organizational schematic...

for her bedroom closet.

Leonard?

This is gonna be bad.

Goodbye, Honey Puffs. Hello, Big Bran.

You came into my apartment
while I was sleeping?

Yes, but only to clean.

Really more to organize,
you're not actually dirty, per se.

Give me back my key.

I'm very, very sorry.

Do you understand how creepy this is?

Yes, we discussed it at length last night.

In my apartment? While I was sleeping?

And snoring.
And that's probably just a sinus infection.

But it could be sleep apnea. You might
wanna see an otorhinolaryngologist.

The throat doctor.

And what kind of doctor
removes shoes from asses?

Depending on the depth...

that's either a proctologist,
or a general surgeon.

Oh.

 God!
 Okay, look. No, Penny...

I think what you're feeling is valid
and maybe later today...

when you're feeling less,
for lack of a better word, violated...

maybe we can talk about this.

 Stay away from me.
 Sure. That's another way to go.

Penny, Penny, hold on.

Just to clarify...

because there will be a discussion
when you leave.

Is your objection solely to our presence
in the apartment while you were sleeping...

or do you also object to the imposition
of a new organizational paradigm?


Well, that was a little non-responsive.

You are going to march yourself
over there right now and apologize.


What's funny?

That wasn't sarcasm?

 No!
 Whoo.

Boy, you are all over the place
this morning.

I have a Master's and two Ph.Ds,
I should not have to do this.

What?

I'm truly sorry
for what happened last night.

I take full responsibility.

I hope that it won't color
your opinion of Leonard...

who is not only a wonderful guy,
but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.

I did what I could.

Hey, Raj.

Hey, I don't know if you heard about
what happened with Leonard and Sheldon...

but I'm really upset about it.

I mean, they let themselves into my place,
and then they cleaned it.

Can you even believe that?
How weird is that?

She's standing very close to me.

Oh, my. She does smell good.

What is that? Vanilla?

You know?

Where I come from, someone comes
into your house at night, you shoot.

Okay? And you don't shoot to wound.

I mean, all right, my sister shot her husband,
but it was an accident, they were drunk.

What was I saying?

She's so chatty.

Maybe my parents were right.
Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl.

We'd have
the same cultural background...

and my wife could sing to my children
the lullabies my mother sang to me.

It's obvious they meant well.

I'm having a really rough time.
Like I said...

I broke up with my boyfriend
and it's freaking me out.


I mean, just because most of the men
I've known happened to be jerks...

doesn't mean I should just assume
Leonard and Sheldon are.

Right?

She asked me a question.
I should probably nod.

That's exactly what I thought.

Thank you for listening. You're a doll.

Uh-oh. Turn your pelvis.


Grab a napkin, homey,
you just got served.

It's fine. You win.

What's his problem?

His imaginary girlfriend
broke up with him.

Been there.

Hello.

Sorry I'm late,
but I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.

Really? You?

Rajesh Koothrappali spoke to Penny?

Actually,
I was less the chatter than the chattee.

What did she say? Is she still mad at me?

Well, she was upset at first...

but probably
because her sister shot somebody.

Then there was something about you,
and then she hugged me.

She hugged you? How did she hug you?

Is that her perfume I smell?

Intoxicating, isn't it?

 Hi.
 Oh.

What's going on?

Uh...

Here's the thing:

"Penny, just as Oppenheimer came to regret
his contributions to the first atomic bomb...

so too I regret my participation
in what was...

at the very least, an error in judgment.

The hallmark
of the great human experiment...

is the willingness
to recognize one's mistakes.

Madam Curie's discovery of radium
turned out to have great potential...

even though she would later die a slow,
painful death from radiation poisoning.

Another example,
from the field of Ebola research..."

Leonard.

Yeah?

We're okay.

 Check.

 One package Philips head screws?
 Check.

Guys, seriously, I grew up
on a farm, okay?

I rebuilt a tractor engine
when I was, like, 12.

I think I can put together
a cheap Swedish media center.

Please, we insist.
It's the least we can do, considering...

Considering what?

How great this place looks?

 Oh, boy, I was afraid of this.
 What?

These instructions
are a pictographic representation...

of the least imaginative way
to assemble these components.

This right here
is why Sweden has no space program.

 It looked pretty good in the store.
 It is an inefficient design.

For example,
Penny has a flatscreen TV...

which means all this space
behind it is wasted.

 We could put her stereo back there.
 And control it how?

Run an infrared repeater,
photocell here, emitter here, easy-peasy.

 Good point. How will you cool it?
 Guys, I got this.

 Hang on, Penny.
 How about fans?

 Here and here.
 Also inefficient, and might be loud.

How about a liquid cooler?
A little aquarium pump here.

Run some quarter-inch PVC...

Guys, this is actually really simple.

Hold on, honey, men at work.

PVC comes here. Maybe a little
corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.

Show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice and a overflow reservoir?

If water's involved,
we'll ground the crap out of the thing.

Guys, it's hot in here.
I think I'll just take off all my clothes.

Oh, I've got it.

What if we replaced panels A, B and F and
crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?

 Entire thing's one big heat sink.
 Perfect.

Leonard and Sheldon, go to the junkyard
and pick up 6 square meters of aluminum.

 Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.
 Meet in an hour?

 Done.
 Got it.

Okay, this place does look pretty good.



Leonard, are you in the shower?

I can't hear you!
I'm in the shower!

I asked if you
were in the shower,

but that's moot now!

What?

Moot! Rendered unimportant
by recent events!

I can't hear you!
I'm in the shower!

I have to skip
the chitchat.

Emergency.

What kind of
emergency?

Mathematical--
32-ounce banana smoothie,

16-ounce bladder.

You might not
want to do that.

I assure you I do.

Sheldon, I'm not alone in here.

What?!

Hello, Sheldon.

What are you doing in there?

She can't be in here!

We were in here first;
you can't be in here.

According to
the roommate agreement,

paragraph nine, subsection B,

"The right
to bathroom privacy

is suspended in the event
of force majeure."

And believe me,
I am experiencing

a very majeure force.

Come on, you can't
wait two minutes?

Oh, Leonard,
let the man pee.

Penny? Penny?

Penny?

What?

Move. Move. Move!

 


Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

you are officially charged

with two violations
of the roommate agreement.

Do you waive

reading of the charges?

Yeah, fine.

Hang on. No.

My client does not waive
reading of the charges.

Oh.

Cool. I've got
a lawyer.

And I've seen her naked.

Proceed.

Very well.

"Count the first:

"On or about
the 28th day of April,

"the accused did knowingly
and with malice aforethought

"deny access
to the shared bathroom

"in a time of emergency, to wit,
my back teeth were floating.

"Count the second:
the accused exceeded

"the agreed upon occupancy
of the shower,

"to wit, one,
unless we are under attack

by water-soluble aliens."

Can I see
the roommate agreement?

Um, it's fairly technical.

I think I can handle it.

Top of her class,
Cambridge University.

Licensed to practice law
in three countries

and your face.

All right,
based on a cursory reading,

it doesn't look like you have
much of a case, Sheldon.

Do so, do so.

Oh, I'm afraid not.

Section seven here, on
the right to enter the bathroom

in emergency situations,
is not specific

as to what constitutes
an emergency.

Oh, that's ridiculous!

A bathroom emergency
is self-explanatory.

Is it? If Leonard forgot
to trim his nose hair,

could he barge in
while you were showering?

Irrelevant. Leonard
doesn't trim his nose hair.

He thinks because he's short
nobody can see up there.

My point is, Sheldon,
the legal principle is,

ambiguity in a contract benefits
the party that did not draft it,

in this case, Leonard.

So much for count one.
But...

There's no buts, Sheldon;
that's how the law works.

Schooled!

As for the shower capacity
issue,

I cite addendum J.

"When Sheldon showers second,
any and all measures

shall be taken to ensure an
adequate supply of hot water."

I believe this supercedes
the occupancy issue.

Superceded!

This isn't over.

No offense, but
shower sex with you

is now the second best thing
that's happened today.

Mmm, Greek food
on pizza night?

This is the most delightfully
cruel thing we've done to Sheldon

since we left that fake message
from Stephen Hawking

on his voice mail.

Seriously?

I wish to discuss your theories
of black holes.

Meet me at the Randy's Donut
by the airport at 2:00 a.m.

What is that you're eating?

Tonight is pizza night.

I'd like to refer that
to my attorney.

According to what I see here,

Thursday nights
are Franconi's pizza night.

Yes, and when Franconi's
went out of business,

we switched to Graziano's.

That's interesting.

Can you just switch
restaurants like that, Priya?

A good question, Howard.

Turns out you can't.

According to
the document

you drew up, Sheldon,
the selection

of a new takeout restaurant
requires public hearings

and a 60-day comment period.

Were those criteria met?

No.

Opa! Opa!
Opa!

This is Greek food?

Leonard, you hate Greek food.

Not as much as you.

Fine. I'm nothing
if not adaptable.

I got you the
lamb kabob.

Thank you.

If you think about it,

Greek food isn't that far
from Italian food.

They share a spice palette.

And what a civilization
is the Greeks'!

They gave us science, democracy,

and little cubes of charred meat
that taste like sweat.

Penny? Penny?

Penny?

Hey. What's up?

The mean Indian lady tried
to make me eat lamb.

Congratulations.

Pizza night will now
be at your apartment.

Order one.

Oh, I'm sorry, honey,

I'm meeting Amy and
Bernadette for dinner.

But you're welcome
to tag along.

A girls' night?

Oh, I don't know
if I'm up for an evening

talking about rainbows,
unicorns and menstrual cramps.

Okay, suit yourself.

We'll probably be
trashing Priya a little.

Shotgun.

Okay, I'd like
to propose a toast

to a wonderful
girls' night out.

Fair warning--
we can get ca-razy.

Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars
and pretended to be dragons.

Really, Amy?

Tobacco and alcohol?

Need I remind you not a lot of
scientific discoveries were made

by people having a good time?

Why did you bring him?

He's harshing my buzz.

I felt sorry for him.

Priya's giving him a hard time.

Ooh, the Priya bashing's
starting early. Yay!

Okay, what's up
with those pantsuits?

I need some context.

Pantsuits suck.

And that opens her up

to justifiable ridicule
for wearing them.

Good one, Bernadette.

See? Ca-razy.

Whee...!

You smell like baby powder.

It's talc.

But as that's a primary
ingredient of baby powder,

I understand your confusion.

Oh, I'm not
confused at all.

You're like a sexy toddler.

I don't know
how to process that.

I do.

 Amy and Sheldon
sitting in a tree 

 K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G. 

That's too many S's
for "kissing."

Not if they're doing it
for a long time.

Sheldon... have you
ever kissed a girl?

Other than my mother,
my sister and my Mee-Maw, no.

But in the interest
of full disclosure,

I was once on a bus

and had to give
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

to an elderly nun who passed out
from heat exhaustion.

Every year I get
a Christmas card from her,

signed with far
too many X's and O's.

That doesn't count.

Aren't you even
a little curious?

Yeah, you're a scientist--
where is the curiosity?

I'm available
for experimentation.

Thank you.

Not necessary.

We know everything
there is to know about kissing.

It requires 34 facial muscles
and 112 postural muscles.

Oh, blah, blah, blah.

Give me some sugar, bestie.

I'm certainly glad
no one said they were curious

about Aztec human sacrifice.

Hey, I know--
let's take Sheldon dancing.

Ooh, I totally want
to see Sheldon dance.

I bet he looks like
a spider on a hot plate.

No, thank you,
but for the record,

I'm an excellent dancer.

Proficient in the rumba,
waltz and cha-cha.

Really?

I don't see why
that's surprising.

I excel at so many things.

You've had my sourdough bread.

Did you take dance lessons?

Against my will.

In the South,
preadolescent children

are forced through
a process called cotillion,

which indoctrinates them
with all the social graces

and dance skills needed to
function in 18th century Vienna.

Oh, we are so
taking you dancing.

No, you most certainly are not.

Well, what does your cotillion
training say is expected

of a gentleman when three ladies
ask him

to escort them
to a dance soiree?

I saved a nun's life.

Why am I being punished?

Take us someplace we can waltz.

Where you can what?

Waltz. It's a social dance
from Austria

choreographed
to a three-four time signature.

Oh, waltz.

Here we go.

 I kissed a girl
and I liked it 

 I hope my boyfriend
don't mind... 

What happened to you?

Shake it baby,
shake it!

Muy caliente, Sheldon!

Care to dance?

Oh, I'm sorry, I'm engaged.

How about you?

Oh, what the hell.

Ooh!

How come if we're
the smart people,

we don't do this
every night?

What's 16 times 14?

My burps taste
like cranberry juice.

And there's your answer.

Would you like to come in
for a nightcap?

If you're referring
to the beverage,

you know I don't drink.

If you're referring
to the hat you don

while wearing a nightshirt and
holding a candle, I have one.

I have Yoo-hoo.

It's hard to say no to Yoo-hoo.

The name literally beckons.

Make yourself comfortable.

Thank you.

Is someone smoking?

Oh, that's just Ricky.

You own a smoking monkey?

Don't be silly.
He's one of the animals

in my department's
nicotine addiction study.

What's he doing here?

I'm giving him emphysema.

The least I can do is let him
hang out and watch cable.

Remarkable.

Aren't you worried
about secondhand smoke?

A little.
The real danger is him biting

my face off while I'm sleeping.

Is he deliberately
blowing smoke at me?

Yeah. He's kind of an ass.

Thank you.

May I share
something with you

that's troubling me?

Of course.

What's rattling around that
big bulbous head of yours?

Priya has essentially nullified

my roommate agreement
with Leonard,

making life in the apartment
very uncomfortable for me.

And you want me
to kill her? Done.

No, of course not.

I trained Ricky how to smoke.

I can train him
to shoot a poison dart.

No jury would convict us
'cause people love monkeys.

I understand

the alcohol has stirred up
whatever it is

that makes girls go wild...

but I really need to talk
to smart Amy now.

Excuse me.

Have you considered
that your intelligence

might be the very thing
causing your dilemma?

No.

What do you think Ricky
over here would do

if an interloper
encroached on his territory?

Well, when challenged, monkeys
generally assert their dominance

through chasing, assault
and a stylized penile display.

That's a little outside
my comfort zone.

You're being too literal.

My point is, he would not meekly
surrender to the rules,

and neither should you.

Are you suggesting I play dirty?

Yes, dirty.

Dirty... dirty... dirty.

Which brings me to our
next order of business.

Fascinating.

I hope you don't take
what I'm about to do

as a comment
on what we just did.

Who's to say you shouldn't be
dissecting our brains?

You really are an ass.

Morning, Sheldon.

Oh, good, you're up.

I've written a new
and improved

roommate agreement
that benefits me greatly.

I'd like you to sign it.

Why would I want
to do that?

Excellent question.

Do you remember
what happened to the alien,

played by talented character
actor Frank Gorshin,

in the Star Trek episode "Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield"?

Uh, Captain Kirk activated
the self-destruct sequence

and threatened to blow up
the Enterprise

and kill them both
unless he gave in?

Affirmative.

Computer, this is
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Activate self-destruct sequence.

Code 1-1-A-2-B.

Self-destruct sequence
activated.

What are you
gonna do, Sheldon,

blow up the apartment?

That was my first thought,
but all my cool stuff is here.

So what happens
when it counts down?

Unless Leonard signs
the new agreement

in the next 41 seconds,

this computer will send an
e-mail to your parents in India

saying that you're in
a secret relationship

with the
whiter-than-Marshmallow-Fluff

Leonard Hofstadter.

Oh, my God.

What's the big deal?

Trust me, it's a big deal.

They're gonna find out
about me eventually, right?

Yeah, of course,
just not today.

20 seconds.

Are you ashamed of me?

Of course not.

Then why can't we
tell your parents?

Please, don't push this.

He does that all the time,
doesn't he? 15.

Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win.
Turn it off.

No, he's bluffing.

I never bluff. Ten.
It's blackmail!

Nine.
We give up.

Eight.
This is ridiculous.

It's a laptop
with a full charge.

Honestly,
what do you see in him?

Give him what he wants
or we're done.

Three.
Really?

Two.
Okay, I'll sign it!

Self-destruct sequence aborted.

You may have gone
to Cambridge,

but I'm an honorary graduate
of Starfleet Academy.

Good morning, Amy.

It most assuredly is not.

Are you experiencing
dehydration, headache,

nausea and shame?

Yes.

I also found a Korean man's
business card

tucked into my cleavage.

What happened last night?

Ah, memory impairment;

the free prize at the bottom
of every vodka bottle.

Sheldon?

All right.

Last night you gave me
some excellent advice

regarding my problem here
at home,

you kissed me and then vomited
on and off for 40 minutes,

following which you passed out
on your bathroom floor.

I then folded a towel under
your head as a pillow,

set your oven clock
to the correct time

because it was
driving me crazy...

and I left.

Okay.

Don't really know
where we go from here.

I suggest
we treat our relationship

as if it were
a crashed computer

and restore it to the last point
we both agree it worked.

Terrific. Thank you.

They were out of menthols!

Get off my back!

Not easy living with a
temperamental little primate.

Come on, Priya,
just admit I embarrass you!

You're preaching
to the choir, sister.



 Kites ho!
 Kites ho!

Kites ho!

Kites ho!

Excuse me.
You're misusing the word "ho."

It's an interjection used to call attention
to a destination, not an object.

As in, uh, "Land ho!"
or, uh, "Westward ho!"

Kites ho!

Hey, guys. What are you doing?

Going out to discover electricity?

If you refer to the work of Benjamin
Franklin, he did not discover electricity.

He merely used a kite to determine
that lightning consists of electricity.

He also invented the Franklin stove,
bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter.

 Kites ho.
 We're heading out for some kite fighting.

 Kite fighting?
 Oh, yeah.

It's an extremely competitive,
cutthroat sport.

Well, actually,
the risk of throat-cutting is very low.

On the other hand, severe string burn
is a real and ever-present danger.

 Uh, you wanna come watch?
 Oh, gee, ha, sounds amazing.

But, um, I've got some friends
coming over.

We're just gonna watch
the Nebraska game.

Oh, football, sure.

Good guess.

I would've invited you,
but you're not a fan.

No. No, I'm not. So, great.

You've got plans
doing something you like...

I've got plans doing something I like,
so it's good.

Maybe we'll hang out
after everybody's gone.

 Yeah, great.
 See you.

Well, this sucks.

I'm sorry, I got bored and drifted off.

Where exactly in the interaction
did the sucking lie?

Leonard realized Penny's hiding him
from her friends...

because he's a tiny little man
who flies kites.

Oh, that certainly would suck.

Wolowitz is trying to outflank us.

Let out some string, add altitude,
I'll go under and cut his line.

Why wouldn't Penny
want her friends to meet me?

Focus, Leonard, focus.

The heat of battle is upon us.
The dogs of war are unleashed.

Maybe Koothrappali's right,
maybe I embarrass her.

You're embarrassing me.

A grown man worrying
about such nonsense.

We're in the middle of flying kites.

 Sorry.
 Sorry won't bring their kites down.

Ouch! String burn. String burn.

Oh, they think we're flanking.
They're playing right into our hands.

At the count of three,
we execute the flying scissor.

 One, two, thre...
 Whoa.

 You see that?
 See what?

 That chick. She smiled at me.
 No, she didn't.

 She did.
 Come on, scissors, scissors.

 Hold my line.
 What? I can't scissors by myself.

Howard, come back!

Victory!

Son of a bitch.

You're a sucky friend, you know that?

A sucky, sucky friend.

What was I supposed to do?
She gave me that come-hither look.

If she gave you any look at all,
it was a you-suck look.

I would've caught up to her
if I hadn't pulled a hammy.

Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds,
you don't have a hammy.

So Penny doesn't want me around her
friends. I embarrass her. What else?

Well, her actions could be
out of concern for your feelings.

Perhaps she's excluded you
from these gatherings...

because she's scouting for a new mate
and doesn't wanna do it in front of you.

Oh, how kind of her.

Agreed. Most primates don't show
that sort of discretion.

A female bonobo will copulate with
a new male in front of the old one...

without so much as a,
"How do you do?"

You always do this. Ditch me
for a woman you don't have a shot with.

 I totally had a shot.
 With a woman you were chasing in a park.

That's not a shot, that's a felony.

What's worse, it cost me
my prized Patang fighting kite.

I don't suppose there's any chance
you could give me my kite back?

I'm sorry, Raj,
but the rules of aerial warfare dictate...

that the fallen kite go to the victor.

And without rules,
the competition has no meaning.

And without meaning, the following
would be an empty gesture:

I have your kite, I have your kite

 Hey.
 Hi.

How was your football party?

 It was pretty good, we won.
 Oh, wow, that's excellent.

Weird figure of speech, isn't it?

"We won,"
when you weren't actually playing.

When we watch Star Wars, we don't say,
"W e defeated the Empire." Ha, ha.

I'm glad to hear it.

Oh, hey, on a related subject...

are you embarrassed
to have me around your friends?

Oh, my God, no.
Why would you ask that?

Well, you know, I just noticed
I haven't really met any of them.

 Sure you have.
 Well, yeah, no.

I met the huge ex-boyfriend...

and the smaller-yet-still-larger-than-me
ex-boyfriend.

By the way, were they here today?

 Of course not.
 Why would they? Why would I ask?

Why am I rambling?
Why don't you stop me?

Leonard, look, if you wanna meet
my friends, that would be great.

I just... You know,
I didn't want you to be bored.

I wouldn't be bored.
Why would I be bored?

Well, because they're not
genius scientists.

Penny, I like all sorts of people.

In fact, some of my best friends
aren't geniuses.

Like who?

Okay, some of my Facebook friends
aren't geniuses.

But... My point is,
if we're gonna be a couple...

 ...I should be friends with your friends.
 Okay, great.

Why don't you come over next Saturday
and watch the game?

Another football game?

They have them every week.

Did not know that.

 You wanted to meet my friends.
 Sure.

Just...
I don't know much about football.

The guys' girlfriends
don't know football.

They just kind of drink
and talk in the kitchen.

Great.

Looking left, he's got nothing.

 He drops off a screen, out of bounds...
 Okay, a completed pass.

First down, New England.

 I think I'm starting to get this.
 Really?

The only thing I've learned is that
American men love drinking beer...

pee too often,
and have trouble getting erections.

Focus on the game,
not the commercials, Raj.

If people cut back on the beer,
you could get out the bathroom...

and satisfy your women
without pharmaceutical help.

Raj, what are you doing here?

You were supposed to help me
pimp out my Vespa.

Are you under the impression
that we're still friends?

Ugh.

Come on, you're not still grinding
on the kite thing, are you?

It's not just the kite thing.

Every time we go someplace,
you dump me...

whenever someone pretty comes
even though you don't have a shot.

I had a shot with that jogger.

Fine. Paint green flames
on your little scooter with her.

It's not a little scooter.

It's the second-biggest Vespa
they make!

You're watching football?

There's no fooling you.

Now, what is this "sacks" statistic
they put up there?

All I know about Saks
is my mother shops there.

Sacks, sacks.

It's football nomenclature
for when a quarterback...

is tackled behind the line
of scrimmage.

Huh.

Scrimmage.

The line of scrimmage
is the imaginary transverse line...

separating the offense
from the defense.

Oh.

Sheldon knows football?

 Apparently.
 I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?

 Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?
 I grew up in Texas.

Football is ubiquitous in Texas.

There's pro football, college football,
high school football, peewee football...

In fact, every form of football
except the original, European football.

Which most Texans believe
to be a commie plot.

 Unbelievable.
 If interested...

I also know all about frying meat
that isn't chicken as if it were chicken.

So you could teach me?

Football or chicken-fried meats?

Football. I'm going to Penny's
to watch a game with her friends.

I don't wanna look like an idiot.
I wanna blend in.

If you wanna blend in...

I'd think looking like an idiot
would be the perfect camouflage.

Sheldon, teach me football.
It'll be fun.

That's exactly what my father said.

"Come to the games.
Watch the games."

Week in and week out,
from the time I was 5...

until I went off to college.
Longest seven years of my life.

Please, I'm asking you as a friend.

Are you making this
a tier-one friendship request?

 Yes.
 Fine.

 I really appreciate this.
 Yeah, yeah.

All right, poindexter,
sit down, shut up and listen.

I'm sorry?

Oh, that's how my father
always began our football conversations.

And if you'd like, after the game,
I'll teach you...

how to shoot close enough
to a raccoon that it craps itself.

When are you gonna stop
making Cylon toast?

When I have enough to destroy
the human toast...

on the Battlestar
known as Galactica.

Is that what you're wearing
to watch football?

 What's wrong with a football jersey?
 Nothing.

That, however,
appears to be a football cocktail dress.

It's the smallest size they had.

Except the one for dogs.

I can't believe they had one for dogs.

Oh, yes. Canine football fans
are a common sight in Texas.

Cats, however,
refuse to wear sporting apparel.

My sister found that out the hard way.

 Anyway, wish me luck.
 Leonard, wait.

Am I correct in assuming
that your attempt...

to be accepted by Penny's peers
is based on your desire to ensure...

your continuing mating privileges
with her?

Well, I wouldn't put it
exactly that way.

How would you put it?

Yeah, okay, like you said.

Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble
to go through for intercourse.

Don't you have access to women
who will do it for money?

By the way, another accepted usage
for the term "ho."

Goodbye, Sheldon.

Now, hold on.

I believe that social convention dictate
you not arrive empty-handed.

Would you like to bring
some Cylon toast?

Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in,
not get laughed at.

What's funny about Cylon toast?

It's open.

Hey, pal.

What do you want?

I brought you a little gift.

New kite.

The kite you made me lose
was an authentic Patang.

An Indian kite my brother sent
to me from New Delhi.

It took me a day to put together
and two days to paint.

This is Hello Kitty.

Yeah, but it comes
with a little coin purse.

Does a Patang?

Wow, you just don't get it, do you?

Buying me something pretty isn't gonna
make our problem just go away.

Look, I admit I haven't always been
the best friend I could be.

You've been a sucky friend.
A sucky, sucky friend.

 Stipulated.
 And you do it all the time.

Last week, we were looking for a phone
with giant numbers for your mother...

 ...and I realize you're not even there.
 I know.

And where were you?

Getting shot down by the girl
at Hot Dog on a Stick.

But in my defense, she was gorgeous.

And working that squeezer
to make the lemonade...

going up and down
and up and down...

It was like a free pole dance
right in the middle of the food court.

You're impossible.

Hey, at least I can talk to women
without being drunk.

Excuse me, I have selective mutism,
a recognized medical disorder.

You're just a douche.

No. You know what?

Maybe that's what this whole thing
is about.

You're not mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.

No, I'm mad at you.
I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.

Look, fine. You're mad at me. I get it.
Now...

How about we go
spend the day together?

Just the two of us.
We'll go anywhere you want.

I don't know.

Come on.

Let me take you someplace nice.

I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.

Really? Now?
With the traffic and the parking? It...

Okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let's go.

Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?

 Yeah.
 Ha-ha-ha.

 Breaks tackle.
 Go, go.

 He breaks another.
 Go! Yes!

Are you people watching this?
Is this amazing or what?

Sweetie, that's a highlight
from the '98 championship game.

Oh. Did not know that. Ha.

 How much beer have you had?
 None, why?

Oh. Just kind of hoping you were drunk.

 Now we're back live.
 Okay, yeah.

No, I can see the difference.

 That's intentional grounding.
 Totally.

Yeah...
That completely was a forward pass...

which they threw intentionally
incomplete to avoid loss of yardage...

or to conserve time.

I can't believe they're not penalized
with the loss of a down...

and by having to move the line of
scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.

 Here. Have some pizza, sweetie.
 Penny, you know I'm lactose intolerant.

I know.
I just need you to stop talking.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

 Sheldon, come in.
 Thank you.

I'd like to make a sandwich,
but I'm out of bread.

 There's some in the fridge.
 You shouldn't keep bread in the fridge.

Staleness is caused
by crystallization of the starch...

which occurs faster
at cool temperatures.

On Earth, we say, "Thank you."

So, Leonard, how goes the mimesis?

 Mimesis?
 You know, mimesis.

An action in which the mimic
takes on the properties...

of a specific object or organism.

Mimesis.

What the hell are you talking about?

I'm attempting
to communicate with you...

without my meaning becoming
apparent to those around you.

Let me try again.

Have the indigenous fauna
accepted you as one of their own?

Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

Oh, I guess so.

Good. Oh, FYI,
after I eat my sandwich...

I'm taking Koothrappali's Patang kite
out for a test run.

Would you get your Delta Wing Raptor
and join me?

I don't wanna fly kites, Sheldon.
Come on, we're watching football here.

I can see that.
I was providing you with an alternative.

A courtesy I was never offered
in similar circumstances.

Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach
has thrown down a red flag...

indicating he's challenging
the ruling on the field.

Hope he's right, because if he's not,
it'll cost him one of his three timeouts.

You know, Leonard, honey...

I wouldn't mind if you wanted
to go fly kites with Sheldon.

I'll watch the end of the game.
There's three minutes left.

Until halftime.

This is just half?

We've been here for hours.

 You're gonna be here for a couple more.
 Oh, you're kidding.

 No.
 Nice meeting all of you.

So, yeah, anyway,
that's my boyfriend.

He is really smart.

I really like my saber-toothed cat.
Thank you.

My pleasure.

Maybe after lunch we can go
to Marie Callender's and have some pie.

 I'd like that.
 Heh.

This is turning out to be
a perfect Saturday.

Good, I'm glad.

Oh, man. Did you see the way
she smiled at me?

Fine. Go ahead.

No. This is our day.

If you wanna chase after her,
chase after her.

Oh, who am I kidding? I wouldn't
have a shot with a girl like that.

Don't put yourself down.
You're very attractive.

 You think so?
 Yeah.

It wouldn't kill you to take a Pilates class
with me now and then...

but you have a certain wiry appeal.

Yeah, well, it doesn't matter,
because she wasn't really smiling at me.

In this case, I think she was.

 Really?
 Yeah.

Bye.

What a douche.




 Howard Wolowitz.

Dave Roeger, here, at NASA. We need
to talk about your upcoming mission.

Yes, yes, I've been doing
my push-ups.

I'm still stuck at nine, but...

That's going all the way down
with no one holding me, heh.

That's great, uh, but that's not why I called.

We've run into a bit of a snafu.

Your Soyuz capsule failed
the pressurization test...

so bottom line,
the mission's been scrubbed.

You're kidding.
So, what does that mean?

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh, heh.

Boy, I gotta tell you,
I'm really disappointed.

This was my dream
ever since I was a little kid.

Okay, uh... Thanks for the call.

Yeah, you too.

Yes! Thank you!


Oh, I'm not gonna die in space!

Phew, I'm gonna die the way God intended.

In my late 50s
with a heart full of pastrami.

I'm going to need a larger shirt.

This one's a little tight under the arms.

Okay.

Maybe it's tight because
you're wearing long underwear?

Yes, of course that's why it's tight.

Let me rephrase the question.

 Why are you wearing long underwear?
 You're kidding.

Shouldn't the question be,
why aren't you?

No, it should be, why are you?

Leonard, these rental tuxedos...

have been worn by hundreds
of sweaty strangers.

I don't like my own sweat
touching my skin.

How do you think I feel about theirs?

 Why don't you slip this on?
 Said the hangman offering a noose.

Heh, well, that wasn't as entertaining
as when he rents bowling shoes...

but it was right up there.

Well, that's it.
My orders have been rescinded.

I am officially "no go" to space.

I'm sorry, Howard, but I gotta tell you,
I'm a little relieved you're not going.

 Why?
 Come on.

You were gonna go in a rocket
designed in the 1960s by the Russians.

Yeah, so?

When was the last time
you heard someone say:

"Ooh, check out this Blu-ray player.
It must be good, it was built in Russia"?

Well, their technology isn't that bad.

When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz
capsule, you free-fall from space...

at 500 miles per hour, and the only
thing that slows you down...

is a parachute that pops out
before you crash into the ground.

The thing was designed
by the same brilliant minds...

who were unable to capture
Rocky and Bullwinkle.

All right, well, whatever.
I wasn't worried.

You weren't?

Okay, let me explain
the difference between you and me.

You watch Star Trek, I live it.

Oh, I don't remember
the episode of Star Trek...

where the guy never goes to space
and brags about it in a tuxedo store.

Make all the jokes you want, but there's
only one of us brave enough...

to almost do what I almost did.

Ah, much better.

You must be burning up.

A little. But not more
than your urethrae will be...

after whatever's in those pants
swims up them.

Well, I cut quite the dashing
yet hygienic figure, don't I?

I look like the Flash
about to get married.

Oh, a tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!

Uh, where's he going?

He keeps emergency Purell
in the car.

Keys. Keys. Keys.

 Hey, you.
 Before I come in, you should know...

I have gas.

For the record,
not your worst opening line.

Check it out. It's the gas I use
in my laser to support high voltages.

But it also has an interesting
secondary use.

Here. Breathe this in.

But before I do it, if you're a cop,
you have to tell me, right?

 Just try it.
 Okay.

Oh, my God, that is so freaky.



You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.


Again. Me, me. Okay.


Leonard, I am your father.


been more attracted to a woman...

 ...who sounds like a man in my life.
 Aw, heh.

Mm.

how we've been taking things slow?

Mm-hm.

Well, I've been thinking...

and maybe I'm ready
to take things a little faster.

 Oh, great.
 Mm-hm.

And I promise, after waiting four months,
fast is what you're gonna get.

Just... Just one thing.
We're in a great place right now.

I don't wanna do anything
that will make stuff weird again.

 So we won't let it get weird.
 Okay.

Oh, just a heads up. Mm.
Since the last time you saw me naked...

I got a Cookie Monster tattoo.

The acceptable responses when you
see it are "awesome" or nothing.

What about...

cookies.



Amy. Amy. Amy

Seven o'clock. Right on time.

It's not an accident.

I waited outside your door
for 20 minutes.

Well, dinner's almost ready.

I must say I was surprised you chose to
spend our date-night in your apartment.

Well, as I mentioned, uh...

the Pasadena City Council
is debating longer crosswalk times...

and later, the Lego store
is having a Midnight Madness sale.

You ask anyone, that's a hot date.

Tempting choices, but I have
something special planned for tonight.

What can be more special than having
an adequate amount of time...

to cross the street on your way
to buy a tiny Lego Indiana Jones?

With our friends moving forward
in relationships...

I have decided
we should make progress in ours.

Oh, dear Lord.

Two years ago,
we didn't even know each other...

and now I'm in your apartment
after dark.

How much faster can this thing go?

Had a feeling you'd be reluctant...

which is why I'm going to dip
into my bag of tricks.

Oh, heh, you brain-monkeys kill me.
Dip away.

I have devised an experiment that
I believe will increase your feelings...

 ...for me in an accelerated time-frame.
 Well, how do you propose to do that?

Uh, I hope you're not thinking about
some sort of LSD thought-control.

There's only one mind-expanding drug
that this man enjoys.

And that's called school.

Human beings form
emotional attachments as they grow up.

In your case, to your mother,
superheroes, et cetera.

I'm going to attempt an experiment...

that will get you
to transfer those feelings to me.

Well, seems what's on
the menu tonight...

is malarkey
with a big side of poppycock.

We'll see. Let's start with
a little romantic dinner music, shall we?


 The "Super Mario Brothers" theme?
 Yes.

I see what you're doing.
You're attempting to build on the work...

of Ebbinghaus by triggering
an involuntary memory...

of me playing that game.

Admittedly the happiest 600 hours
of my childhood.

 But it won't work.
 Fine.

There's no reason we can't have a lovely
dinner. Why don't you have a seat?


 May I offer you something to drink?
 You know I don't drink.

Not even Strawberry Quik?

I love Strawberry Quik.

It's my favorite pink fluid...

uh, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.

Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely
with what I have prepared for dinner.

Spaghetti with little pieces
of hot dog cut up in it.

 Just like your mommy used to make.
 Oh.

Yummy, yummy.

Yeah, we should do this more often.

Uh-oh.

I'm sorry, I did. I crossed a line.
I didn't mean to!

Who says that
right in the middle of sex?

I don't know. It just came out.

People say weird things
during sex all the time.

 Well, they sure as hell don't say that.
 Lt was the heat of the moment.

No, the heat of the moment is,
"Yeah, just like that"...

not, "Will you marry me?"

 I'm sorry, just give me another chance.
 So you can crawl under covers and go:

"Hey baby, wanna go look for houses
in neighborhoods with good schools"?

Again, I'm sorry. With Howard
and Bernadette getting married...

I got caught up
in a little wedding fever.

I take it back.

You can't take something like that back.
What are we supposed to do now?

Okay, at some point, we'll look back
and this is going to be a funny story.

Why don't we just start
doing that now?

 You're kidding.
 No.

Hey, do you remember...

that time when I proposed to you
in bed, heh?

And you were all, like,
"What are you doing"?


That was so funny.

So funny.

 It's not funny.
 Just give it a minute.

Is that a little smile I see there?

I should go.

Hey, I was thinking, for our first dance
at the wedding...

what if we learn the final number
from Dirty Dancing?

 You're kidding.
 No, come on.

How cool would that be?
Me running into your arms.

You lifting me up into the air.


 You're in a good mood.
 Yeah, well, why wouldn't I be?

I'm marrying the girl of my dreams...

and finally got my mother to agree
not to come on our honeymoon.



Oh, hang on.

Oh, it's NASA.

Wolowitz.

Oh, hi, Dave. What's up, heh?

No kidding. Really, heh?

Well, that's great news.

Great, great news.

All right, I'll watch my e-mail
for the details.

Okay, talk soon.

What's so great?

It looks like I'm going into space
after all, heh.

Howie, that's wonderful.

Uh-huh, wonderful.

Yay!

What happened?
I thought they cancelled your mission.

They... They did.
But NASA really wants my telescope...

up on the space station, so they're
putting me on an earlier launch.

When?

A week from Friday.

What? We're getting married
that Sunday.

You're right, heh. I... I can't go to space.
I have to get married...

and no one can say that's not
a good reason. I'll call him back.

Wait. I don't wanna be the one
who stands in your way.

Well, too bad, you already did.
It's a done deal. But I forgive you.

No. That's not how I wanna start
our marriage.

Killing your dream? We'll have
the wedding when you get back.

Yeah, but what about all the plans
and the guests?

We'll call them.

Although my dad's gonna go
a little nutso over losing his deposits.

You're right, he is.

Your dad's gonna be furious.

There's no way he's gonna let us
postpone this wedding.

Well, we tried.

I'll talk to him.
He won't say no to his little girl, heh.

No, I... l should talk to him.
You know, man to man.

Howie, my dad can be a bully.

He's gonna make you cancel
your flight.

Yeah, we can only hope, heh,
that he doesn't.

Bishop to queen four, level two.

 Check.
 Sheldon, Knight takes Bishop.

You all right?

I'm fine.

Are you? You left your queen exposed
from above...

trapped your knight in the corner,
and you keep sighing and saying:

"Why me?"


Very well.

Can I ask you a question
about women?

We got you that book last year.
Wasn't everything in there?

No. I'm having
a relationship problem with Amy.

And by the way,
that book gave me nightmares.

If it makes you feel any better...

I screwed things up pretty good
with Penny.

Look at us, Leonard.

Engaging in the social convention of
men bellyaching about their old ladies.

I guess we are. So...

What's going on?

Believe it or not,
Amy has embarked on a campaign...

to increase my feelings for her
by making me happy.

I'm sorry,
that must be very difficult for you.

It's awful. This morning...

she arranged for me to be
an Amtrak Junior Conductor for the day.

It's usually only open to children.
She got them to make an exception.

Shame on her.

They let me blow the whistle,
Leonard.

She's good.

I know. And it gets worse.

Her efforts are causing me
to have affectionate feelings for her...

at inappropriate times.

You mean like in bed
or in the shower?

No. And would you please stop
referencing that infernal book?

For example, this morning...

I was calculating the random motion
of virtual particles in a vacuum...

when suddenly, the particles morphed
into an image of Amy's dandruff...

gently cascading down onto her pale,
slightly hunched shoulders.


What has that vixen done to me,
Leonard?

How do I make it stop?

Well, if you had a physical relationship,
I'd say propose during sex.

Turns out that's a real mood-killer.

 I assume we're talking about you now?
 Yeah.

So that's how this works?
I complain and then you complain...

and no one offers any solutions?

Pretty much.

Well, no wonder the women
are winning.

Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?

Just looking at some old pictures.
Come on in.

Family pictures, or...?
Holy crap, that's a dead person.

Last murder case before I retired.

How many bodies do you see there?

Careful. It's a trick question.

 I'm not sure.
 No, you'll never get it. It's a fraction.

How about that, heh.

Anyway, sir,
I need to talk to you about something.

Walnut?

No, thank you. I'm allergic.

Oh, sure. My partner used to have that.
He's dead now.

 From nuts, heh?
 No, his wife shot him.

But she was nuts. So in a way...

Nice story. Anyway...

the reason
I wanted to talk to you is...

NASA has moved up my launch
to the international Space Station.

 Yeah, so?
 So the date is going to conflict...

with me marrying your daughter.
Now, I know what you're going to say.

I made a commitment to Bernadette
and to your family...

and I've got a lot of nerve coming here
and demanding that we postpone this.

Well, message heard and understood.
Mission cancelled. Thank you.

Where are you going?

I'm sorry.

May I be excused?

No, you may not.
Let me tell you something.

When I first met you...
You just gonna stand there?

I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Is this going to...?

Well, I should sit...
May I be seated? I'll just sit.

When I first met you, I didn't like you.

I'm aware of that, sir.

But then you and I
had some time together.

Uh-huh, heh.

It did not get better.

Right, right, heh.

That silly Beatle haircut.

You riding around on a red Vespa.

And you're still living at home
with your mother.

To be honest, I thought Bernadette
chose you to punish me.

But then I heard
about your astronaut thing...

and I realized I judged you too fast.

Maybe you are the right guy
for my little girl.

Oh, I am. And just so you know
I'd still be an astronaut...

even if I didn't go to space, heh.

You know, I've got an ID card
and a NASA golf shirt.

No, no. You gotta go.

You can't turn down
an opportunity like this.


But what about the wedding...

and all the money you put down
for the reception?

You let me worry about that.

You go up to that space station
and you make me proud.

Um, okay.


You got a problem with that?

All right, look,
I'm gonna level with you.

I'm terrified about going into space.

I mean, uh,
what if I don't make it back?

It's gonna be okay, son.

 You really think so?
 Of course.

A pretty girl like Bernadette.
She'll find a new guy.

 Hey.
 Hey.

 Off to work?
 Yeah.

 Have a nice night.
 Okay, you too.

Penny, just wait.

I've been thinking about what I said
when we were in bed.

Yeah, I've been thinking about it too.

I noticed you never answered me.

You're right.

No.

 Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?

 Is it still weird because I proposed?

I have a couple more
quick questions.

 Do you wanna call me from the car?

I played that pretty well.


Hello, Leonard.

 What are you doing?
 We're playing doctor.

Star Trek style.

I'm in hell, Leonard.

Don't stop.




Hey, Leonard, check this out.

Leonard, she's doing it again.

I think it upsets Sheldon
when you play with the food.

No, it upsets Sheldon when she
willy-nilly takes it from the containers...

without regard
for its equitable distribution.

This is essentially
why you have famine in India.

You want me to put it back?

 Leonard?
 It upsets Sheldon...

when you play with the Sheldon.

What's up, my nerdizzles?

Raj, Sheldon, I want you
to meet my girlfriend, Bernadette.

 Hello.
 Leonard, Penny.

 You know my girlfriend, Bernadette.
 Yeah. Hey.

Bernadette,
say "fo'shizzle" to my nerdizzles.

I don't think I can.

I don't have Howard's street cred.

I hope it's all right, I told Bernadette
she could join us for dinner.

 Sure. The more, the merrier.
 No, that's a false equivalency.

More does not equal merry.

If there were 2000 people in this apartment,
would we be celebrating?

No, we'd be suffocating.

 Sheldon.
 Don't "Sheldon" me.

 We ordered for five people, not six.
 It's fine.

We'll put it on the table, family-style.

Oh, sure. Why don't we put our hands
behind our backs...

have an old-fashioned
eating contest?

Relax. It'll be fine. Sit down, you guys.

 No.
 What?

Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.

 Why not?
 That's where Sheldon sits.

He can't sit somewhere else?

In the winter, that seat's close enough
to the radiator...

so he's warm
yet not so close that he sweats.

In the summer,
it's in the path of a breeze...

created by opening windows there.

It faces the television at an angle
that isn't direct so he can talk...

yet not so wide
that the picture looks distorted.

Perhaps there's hope for you after all.

 I love your shoes.
 Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren't they?

 Where'd you get them?
 Shoes for Less.

 I've been meaning to go over there.
 Oh, great selection, great prices.

My mother was right. Hell is real.

Come on, Sheldon,
let the women-folk chat.

Women-folk?

Gals? Chicks?

Utero-Americans?

 Just eat your dinner.
 Don't take him too seriously.

A lot of what he says
is intended as humor.

Yeah, well,
I don't think it's very funny.

Me neither,
but he just lights up when I laugh.

Howard, never let her go.

Leonard, Howard says you're working on
fundamental tests...

 ...of quantum mechanics.
 I am. Are you interested in physics?

I find it fascinating.

If I hadn't gone into microbiology...

I probably would have gone
into physics or ice dancing.

My tests of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum interference effect...

have reached an interesting point.

We're testing phase shift
due to electric potential.

 That's amazing.
 Yes.

Leonard's work is nearly
as amazing as third graders...

growing lima beans
in wet paper towels.

While I appreciate the "oh, snap".

I'm uncomfortable having
your moist breath in my ear.

Are you going to try to set up
the voltages using tunnel junctions?

Yes, I am.

 Wanna see a simulation on my laptop?
 Oh, yeah. Show me.

In microbiology, the most exciting thing
I get to work with is yeast.

 Howard?
 Yeah?

Your shoes are delightful.

Where did you get them?

 What?
 Buzzinga. I don't care.

Ha-ha. Eat my dust,
racially stereotypical plumber.

That's not fair.
I got stuck behind a tree.

And a cow and a penguin.

Face it, dude, whether it's a real car
or a virtual cartoon car, you can't drive.

 Just need a little more practice.
 What you need is cheat codes...

motor skills and a genie
who grants wishes...

to little boys
who suck at "Mario Kart."

Sheldon,
can I talk to you for a second?

It's not about shoes, is it?

I don't think
I could go through that again.

 It's not about shoes.
 Then speak.

 Um, actually, can we do it in private?
 All right.

Go away.

I agree, it's rude,
but she asked for privacy.

Thanks, Raj.
Okay, so here's the thing.

I was wondering if you could
maybe teach me a little physics.

 A little physics?
 Yeah.

There's no such thing.
Physics encompasses the entire universe.

From quantum particles to supernovas.

From spinning electrons
to spinning galaxies.

Okay, cool,
I don't need the PBS special.

I wanna know enough
so I can talk to Leonard about his job.

Like Bernadette does.

 Why can't Leonard teach you?
 Because I wanna surprise him.

Can't you surprise him
in some other way?

For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully
taken aback if you clean your apartment.

Come on, Sheldon,
this is important to me.

This would be
a massive undertaking...

and my time
is both limited and valuable.

You're sitting here
playing video games all day.

Okay, point.

What sort of foundation do you have?

Did you take any science classes
in school?

Sure. I did the one with the frogs.

The one with the frogs.

It was pretty cool. A lot of the girls
threw up. I gutted that thing like a deer.

No. I'm sorry, Penny. I don't think so.

Oh, come on, a smart guy like you?
It'll be a challenge.

You could make it like an experiment.

Interesting.

I suppose if someone could teach
sign language to Koko the gorilla...

I could teach you
some rudimentary physics.

Great. It's a little insulting, but great.
I'll be Koko.

Mm. Not likely. Koko learned to understand
over 2000 words.

Not one of which
had anything to do with shoes.

Hey, fellas,
this is my girlfriend, Bernadette.

My girlfriend, Bernadette.

 Who are all those people?
 I have no idea.

 Hey, Leonard.
 Hi.

Look, it's Howard
and his girlfriend, Bernadette.

Thought I'd give the little woman
a tour of the old salt mines. Heh.

He doesn't mean salt mines.
He means where he works.

Yeah, no, I got it.

 So how's your experiment going?
 Terrific.

Getting the electron accelerator set up.
We should be ready day after tomorrow.

 Boy, I'd love to see that.
 You're welcome to come.

Really? That'd be great.

How exciting is that?

Like Hanukkah in July.

Do they have that?

 No.
 Oh, you got me again.

This isn't non-fat yogurt.
This is fatty-fat fat.

Excuse me.

 Could you grab me another napkin?
 Sure.

Thanks, honey.

All right. What is your deal?

Excuse me?

Inviting my girlfriend
to come see your electron accelerator?

Yeah, so?

Wow, you really are a piece of work.

It's not enough
you get the prom queen...

you have to get the head
of the decorating committee too?

 What are you talking about?
 Look, don't play innocent with me.

I practically invented using
fancy lab equipment to seduce women.

 Has it ever worked?
 Not so far, but that's not the point.

Howard, relax.
I am not interested in your girlfriend.

I hope not,
because you don't wanna mess with me.

I'm crazy.

I believe you.

Research journal, entry one.

I'm about to embark on one of the great
challenges of my scientific career:

teaching Renny physics.

I'm calling It Project Gorilla.

 Hey, Sheldon.
 Come in. Take a seat.

Subject has arrived.

I've extended a friendly,
casual greeting.

Ready to get started?

One moment.

Subject appears well-rested
and enthusiastic.

Apparently, ignorance Is bliss.

All right, let us begin.

 Where's your notebook?
 Um, I don't have one.

How are you gonna take notes
without a notebook?

I have to take notes?

How else are you gonna study
for the tests?

 There's gonna be a test?
 Tests.

Here. It's college-ruled.
I hope that's not too intimidating.

 Thank you.
 You're welcome.

Now, introduction to physics.

What is physics?

Physics comes
from the ancient Greek word "physika."

It's at this point
that you'll wanna start taking notes.

Physika means the science
of natural things.

And it is there in ancient Greece
that our story begins.

 Ancient Greece?
 Ah. If you have questions, raise your hand.

It's a warm summer evening,
circa 600 B.C.

You've finished your shopping
at the local market or agora.

And you look up at the night sky.

And there you notice
some of the stars seem to move...

so you name them planetes
or wanderer.

Yes, Penny?

Does this have anything to do
with Leonard's work?

This is the beginning of a 2600-year
journey we're going to take together...

from the ancient Greeks
through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr...

to Erwin Schr�dinger...

to the Dutch researchers
that Leonard is currently ripping off.

 Twenty-six hundred years?
 Yeah, give or take.

As I was saying, it's a warm summer
evening in ancient Greece...

 Yes, Penny.
 I have to go to the bathroom.

 Can't you hold it?
 Not for 2600 years.

Project Gorilla, entry two.

I am exhausted.

 Howard?
 Uh... Huh?

It unhooks in the front.

Oh, that explains a lot.

Howard, I'm home.

Of course.

Senior fitness was canceled.

It turns out you can forget
how to ride a bike.

I'm fine, but, oy,
did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.

That's great, Ma.

What's great
about an 80-year-old Armenian man...

with half his chin scraped off?

 I guess I should go.
 No, don't move.

Hey, Ma,
can I have lamb stew for dinner?

Lamb stew?
I'd have to go to the supermarket.

Please? I got a real hankering.

Oh, I can't say no
to my little tushy-face.

 I'll be back soon.
 Thanks, Ma.

Do you want the
regular peas or the Le Sueur?

Always Le Sueur peas
with lamb stew.

You're right.
When you're right, you're right.

 What if they're out of the Le Sueur?
 Then get the regular!

All right. You don't have to yell.

Sorry about that.

 Let me just put that on vibrate.
 I'm already on vibrate.

Okay, now, that one I got.

Howard, did you say something
to Leonard about me?

What do you mean?

He says if I go see his experiment
tomorrow, it might weird you out.

Really? He said that?

 You're not jealous of Leonard, are you?
 Me? No.

I may have mentioned
that it's a little inappropriate...

to be asking another man's girlfriend
to his experiment...

without discussing it with said man.

I need to ask your permission
to hang out with Leonard?

I didn't say anything like that.
I said Leonard has to ask my permission.

Come on, I don't wanna eat lamb stew
with my mother.

Damn. Was this close on the bra.

Now, remember, Newton realized
that Aristotle was wrong...

and force was not necessary
to maintain motion.

So let's plug in our 9.8 meters
per second squared...

as A and we get force...
Earth gravity.

equals mass times
9.8 meters per second per second.

So we can see that MA equals MG
and what do we know from this?

Uh... We know that Newton
was a really smart cookie.

Oh, is that where Fig Newtons
come from?

No, Fig Newtons are named
after a small town in Massachusetts.

 No, don't write that down.
 Sorry.

Now, if MA equals MG...

 ...what does that imply?
 I don't know.

What...? But...?
How can you not know? I just told you.

Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

Hey, you don't have to be so mean.

I'm sorry. Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

No. You just suck at teaching.

Really? Of those two explanations,
which one seems the most likely?

Oh, God.

Sheldon, look, I'm trying to understand
but you're going too fast.

 Can you just back up a little bit?
 All right.

It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece...

Not that far back.

Okay, at what point
did you begin to feel lost?

I don't know. Where were we looking up
at the night sky?

 Greece.
 Damn it.

Look,
there's no need to get frustrated.

People learn at different rates.

Unlike objects falling in a vacuum,
which...?

MA equals MG...?

 Squared?
 No.

 Aristotle?
 No.

 Five?
 Oh!

Oh, then I don't know.

 Why are you crying?
 Because I'm stupid.

Well, that's no reason to cry.

No, one cries because one is sad.

For example, I cry because
others are stupid and it makes me sad.

Look, can we just please forget
about all this extra stuff...

and can you just tell me
what Leonard does?

All right.

Leonard is attempting to learn...

why subatomic particles
move the way they do.

Really? That's it?
Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.

It's not. That's why Leonard does it.

Okay, I just have one question.

What exactly are subatomic particles?

 A good question.
 Thank you.

And to answer it, we first must
ask ourselves, "What is physics?"

Oh, balls.

It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece.

Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.

What did I do now?

I was in bed with Bernadette
and you text-blocked me.

 What?
 Yeah, we were completely naked...

and about to devour each other
when:

You text her that I have a problem
with her hanging with you.

You do have a problem with her
hanging out with me.

But that's not what you tell her.

 What was I to tell her?
 I don't know.

Something that doesn't make me
come off as a petty, jealous douche.

And what would that be?

Come on,
do I have to think of everything?

Hey, Leonard,
am I too late to see your experiment?

 Oh, hi.
 Hi.

 What are you doing here?
 Same thing you're doing here.

 Came to see Leonard's experiment.
 No, you didn't.

You said Leonard's experiment
was stupid.

You told her my experiment
was stupid?

I was just repeating
what Sheldon said.

Look, let's not get off topic.
Bernadette, I need to apologize.

You know, I was wrong to tell you
who you should be friends with.

 Should I leave you two alone?
 No, Leonard, you should hear this.

Okay, good.
Because I wasn't really gonna go.

Look, I know I come off
as confident and worldly...

but the truth is I'm not.

We're shocked.

Which is why I tend to feel threatened
by other guys.

Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.

But I now realize how foolish that is.

He had a panic attack once
when he got his head stuck in his sweater.

It was a full turtleneck.

 And why aren't you helping me?
 I don't know.

Maybe because I'm crazy?

Bernadette, please, I'm asking you
to give me another chance.

What do you think, Leonard?
Should I give him another chance?

It's up to you.
He didn't call your experiment stupid.

Come here, tushy-face.

Tushy-face.
That is going on Twitter right now.

Raj, you should've seen
Leonard's experiment.

The interference pattern was cool
when the electron beam was on.

I'm glad you enjoyed it. Most people
aren't that interested in what I do.

Actually, that's not true, Leonard.

I've been thinking that, given
the parameters of your experiment...

the transport of electrons
through the nano-fabricated rings...

is no different than the experiment
already conducted in the Netherlands.

Their observed phase shift in
the diffusing electrons inside the ring...

already demonstrated
the electric analogue...

of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum interference effect.

That's it. That's all I know.

Oh, wait.

Fig Newtons were named after a town
in Massachusetts, not the scientist.



So you see, what you're eating
is not technically yogurt,

because it doesn't have
enough live acidophilus cultures.

It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.

That's very interesting.

It's also not pink
and has no berries.

Yeah, but it doesn't
really answer my question.

 What was your question again?
 Do you want some?

 Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
 Right.

 So, gas.
 Yeah, got it.

Well... good night.

What are you doing?

There's a draft.

I didn't feel a draft.

Why don't we just go into, your...

Yeah, you know what, maybe
we should slow things down a little.

I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to...

 go fast.
 No, I know.

I know what you meant, it's just...
this is only our first date.

Okay, sure, no problem.

Why don't we just figure out
where we're going

and when we want to get there,

and then rate of speed
equals distance over time.

Solve for R.

Or we could just wing it.

That might work, too.

 Good night, Leonard.
 Good night.

He's coming. Screensaver!

Hey, Leonard.
How was your date?

Bite me.

Sheldon, how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me?

They were clever.

They exploited my complete lack
of interest in what you were doing.

You should thank us.
When future generations try to determine

why your relationship
with Penny crashed and burned,

this right here is the black box.

What are you talking about?
The date went fine.

She said she wants
to slow things down.

Okay, so she said
she wants to slow things down.

It's like saying,
"I'm really enjoying this meal.

"I'm going to slow down
and savor it."

No, it's like,
"This fish tastes bad,

"so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out."

 You being the fish.
 I'm not the fish.

Really?
Did you make a second date?

No, we sort of decided to wing it.

Even I know that's lame.

Okay, all right,
let's assume your hypothesis.

We went to dinner, we talked,
we laughed, we kissed.

Where could I have possibly gone wrong?

Think back, Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.

Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot,

"I bet we could get her
to come home with us."

Or, "How much
does your mom weigh?

"I want to know what I'm getting into."

 I didn't say anything like that.
 Good, 'cause they don't work.

They also don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

Sadly, that's my home run swing.

Look, everything went fine.

I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.

That woman across the hall is into me.

Let's go to the tape.

Look at her reaction
to the good night kiss.

No change in respiration,
pupils un-dilated,

 no flushing of the chest.
 Nice close-up, by the way.

Interesting. Her jaws are clenched:
no tongue access.

Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.

That's not a bad sign.

Please, you might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.

I'm not there
because I'm taking things slow,

which, by the way, compared to you guys,
approaches warp speed.

And take down that camera.

He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.

Give him time.



Hi.

Oh, hi, Penny.

FYI, the hot water is inadequate
on machine two, so colors only,

and four is still releasing the fabric
softener too early in the cycle,

 so avoid using it for your delicates.
 Thanks.

Good Lord...
why don't you just take your clothes

down to the river
and beat them with a rock?

Can I ask you a question?

I would prefer that you not,
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

All right, I heard yes, so...

Here's my question.

Has Leonard ever dated,

you know, a regular girl?

I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.

Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.

No, I meant, has he ever been involved
with someone

who wasn't a brainiac?

A few years ago,
he did go out with a woman

who had a PhD
in French literature.

How is that not a brainiac?

Well, for one thing, she was French.

For another,
it was literature.

So...

Do you think that if
Leonard and I keep dating,

he'll eventually
get bored with me?

 That depends.
 On what?

Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?

Do you speak Klingon?

 You know any card tricks?
 Okay, you know what...

I get it.
Leonard has no business being involved

with a waitress-slash-actress
who felt so insecure

that she lied to him
about finishing community college.

Why would you lie about that?

He was going on and on
about this college and that grad school,

I didn't want him to think
I was some kind of stupid loser.

You thought the opposite
of "stupid loser"

was "community college graduate"?

You know, there are a lot
of successful people in this country

who are community college graduates.

Yeah, but you are neither.

Right.

Okay, this is between you and me.
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

You're asking me to keep a secret?

Well, I'm sorry,

but you would have had to express
that desire before revealing the secret,

so I could've chosen if I wanted to
accept the covenant of secret keeping.

You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.

What?

Secret keeping
is a complicated endeavor.

One has to be concerned
not only about what one says,

but about facial expressions,
autonomic reflexes.

When I try to deceive,
I myself have more nervous tics

than a Lyme disease research facility.

It's a joke.

It relies on the homonymic relationship

between "tick,"
the bloodsucking arachnid,

and "tic,"
the involuntary muscular contraction.

I made it up myself.

Okay, look, if Leonard
finds out that I lied,

I will absolutely die
of embarrassment.

 Physiologically impossible.
 Sheldon, please.

Look, I am asking you as a friend.

So you're saying that friendship
contains within it

an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?

Yeah.

Interesting.

One more question, and perhaps
I should have led with this.

When did we become friends?

 i.e., I couldn't
become Green Lantern

unless I was chosen
by the Guardians of Oa,

but given enough start-up capital
and an adequate research facility,

I could be Batman.

You could be Batman?

Sure.
I'm Batman. See?

 Hi, guys.
 Hi, Penny.

If you're free Friday night,
I thought maybe we could go see a movie.

Oh, you know, I think I have
the dinner shift on Friday.

What about Saturday?

I'm not sure; the manager
hasn't posted the schedule yet.

 How about I let you know?
 Great.

So you just let me know
when you know.

Okay, so...
Oh, God, I am the bad fish.

What did I do wrong?

Why are you asking me?

I have no information
about your interactions with Penny

other than what you have provided me,

nor do I have any method
of learning such things.

 What does that mean?
 Nothing.

You seem to be implying
an informational back-channel

between me and Penny
where obviously none exists.

No, I didn't.

I just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things, sir.

 What's going on with you?
 I might ask you the same question.

Why are you attempting to drag me

into matters which have nothing
to do with me,

but exist between you and Penny,
a person to whom I barely speak?

What's wrong with your face?

There's no reason
to bring my looks into this.

Good day, Leonard.

 What?
 I said, "Good day."

"Good day"?

Also today, we have
a fresh-caught Alaska salmon,

and that's served
with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice.

 Our soup of the day is...
 You must release me from my oath.

Sheldon, I'm working.

 Why don't you take a minute to decide?
 Oh, my...

I can't keep your secret.

I'm going to fold
like an energy-based de novo protein

in conformational space.

Like a Renaissance tryptich.

Like a cheap suit.

Look, why is it so hard for you
to keep one little secret?

I'm constitutionally incapable.
That's why I was refused clearance

for a prestigious
government research fellowship

at a secret military supercollider

located beneath a fake
agricultural station

12.5 miles southeast
of Traverse City, Michigan.

Which you did not hear about
from me.

Just forget I told you about me...

 not graduating from community college.
 Forget?

You want me to forget?
This mind does not forget.

I haven't forgotten a single thing

since my mother stopped
breastfeeding me.

 It was a drizzly Tuesday.
 Okay...

You promised me
you would keep my secret,

so just figure out a way to do it.

Leonard, I'm moving out.

What do you mean, you're moving out?
Why?

There doesn't have to be a reason.

Yeah, there kinda does.

Not necessarily.

This is a classic example
of Munchausen's Trilemma.

Either the reason is predicated
on a series of sub-reasons

leading to an infinite regression,

or it tracks back to arbitrary
axiomatic statements,

or it's ultimately circular,

i.e. I'm moving out
because I'm moving out.

I'm still confused.

Leonard, I don't see
how I could have made it any simpler.

Hey, qu'est-ce que s'up?

We just got back from that exhibit
of those plasticized human cadavers.

And some of those skinless chicks
were hot!

If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to pack.

That's kind of an overreaction
to a little harmless necrophilia.

It's not you, Howard.
He says he's moving out.

What did you do?

Did you change the contrast
or brightness settings on the TV?

Did you take a Band-Aid off
in front of him?

Did you buy generic ketchup,
forget to rinse the sink,

talk to him
through the bathroom door?

Adjust the thermostat,
cook with cilantro,

pronounce the "t" in often?

Did you make fun of trains?

No, I didn't do anything.
He's just gone insane.

We all knew this day was coming.

That was fast.

It's my pre-packed disaster
evacuation bag.

It's recommended by the Department
of Homeland Security.

And Sarah Connor.

Where are you going to live?

Until I find a permanent place,
I will stay with friends.

Bye.

You can't stay with me.
I have a teeny-tiny apartment.

Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests
an aspect of manushya yajna,

one of the five central religious duties
or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?

I hate trains.

Don't be ridiculous,
you love trains.

Yes, I do. Come on.

See you later, Leonard.

This could work.

This is a very old building.

60 years.
It used to be a watch factory.

What?

Don't you worry
about the residual radium

from the luminous dials?

Not until now!

I can't believe I didn't bring
my Geiger counter.

I had it on my bed
and I didn't pack it.

 If you're not comfortable staying...
 I'm kidding, I packed it.

It was a joke.

I was subverting
the conversational expectations.

I believe they call that
the... ol' switcheroo.

Terrific.

Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?

Yes, isn't she an amazing actress?

Actually, I'd say
she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.

How dare you!

Aishwarya Rai is a goddess.

By comparison,
Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.

Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

Obviously, you're not that familiar
with Indian cinema.

Who is it?

Strip-o-Gram!

Tag, you're it.

Shouldn't you put him
in a brown paper bag

and set him on fire?!

I've never slept
on an air mattress before.

No lumbar support whatsoever.

Maybe you'd be happier
on a park bench.

I don't see any way
to get a park bench in here.

 Do you want to switch?
 No, that's fine.

I'm perfectly comfortable
sleeping on a bouncy castle.

 Get out of bed. We're switching.
 Only if you want to.

Just get in the bed!

What's going on?

Are you boys roughhousing?

We're just talking, Ma!

If you don't settle down right now,

I'm not going to let you
have any more sleepovers!

For God's sake, Ma,
I'm 27 years old!

And it's not even a school night!

Comfy now?

That poster of Halle Berry
is a little unnerving.

So don't look at it.

She's like
my fourth favorite Catwoman.

No kidding.

Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer,
Eartha Kitt, and then her.

What about Lee Merriweather?

I forgot about Lee Merriweather.

I'm glad that's settled.

That makes Halle Berry
my fifth favorite Catwoman.

It's Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer,

 Eartha Kitt, Lee Merriweather...
 Please, I'm begging you. Go to sleep.

I'm trying. I'm counting Catwomen.

She did make a fine mutant
in the X-Men movies, though.

 For God's sake.
 She's not my favorite of the X-Men.

In order that would be:
Wolverine, Cyclops...

I forgot Professor X.

Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops,

Iceman, then Storm,
Angel, the Beast--

No, wait, Nightcrawler.

Professor X, Nightcrawler,
Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, Storm,

Angel...

I'm coming!

There he is.

There my old buddy bud bud.

What's with him?

Koothrappali dumped him on me,
and he couldn't get to sleep,

so I gave him a glass of warm milk

with a handful
of my mom's Valium in it...

but he still wouldn't shut up,
so tag, you're it.

I'm ba-ack.

 I still don't know why you left.
 I can't tell you.

Why not?

I promised Penny.

You promised Penny what?

I wouldn't tell you the secret.

What secret?
Tell me the secret.

Mom smokes in the car.

Jesus is okay with it
but we can't tell Dad.

Not that secret. The other secret.

 I'm Batman!
 Damn it! Sheldon!

You said Penny told you a secret.
What's the secret?

Okay, I'll tell you,

but you can't tell Leonard.

I promise.

Penny lied about graduating
from community college

'cause she's afraid
she's not smart enough for Leonard.

So it's nothing I did?
It's her problem?

I drank milk that tasted funny.

Penny thinks I'm too smart for her.
That's ridiculous.

I know.

Most of your work
is extremely derivative.

And don't worry,
that's not a secret.

Everybody knows.

Hi. Yeah, hi.

I know what's been bothering you
about us, and I have the answer.

What are you talking about?

First, I wanna say
that it's not Sheldon's fault.

He tried very hard to keep your secret.

If Howard hadn't drugged him,
he would've taken it to his grave.

 He told you?
 Yes, but it's okay.

Now that we know what the problem is
there's a simple solution.

Pasadena City College?

"A place for fun,
a place for knowledge."

This man here is playing hackey-sack,
and this girl's gonna be a paralegal.

Oh, I get it.

Because Dr. Leonard Hofstadter

can't date a girl
without a fancy college degree.

It's really not that fancy.
It's just a city college.

Right, but I have to have some
sort of degree to date you?

That doesn't matter to me at all.

So it's fine with you
if I'm not smart.

Absolutely.

Okay, this time,
I know where I went wrong.

Bite me!



Buona sera, Luigi's Pizza.

Buona sera.

It means good evening
in Italian.

May I say, having to explain
that to you calls into question

the authenticity
of your ristorante?

Okay, I'm out of here.

Un momento.

Oh, for heaven's sake.

Now you're being
deliberately stupid.

Where are you going?

I'm having dinner
with Priya at Raj's.

I think Howard's going to be
there. You want to join us?

But tonight's Thursday.

On Thursdays, everybody
comes over here

and has pizza.

Or a reasonable facsimile

prepared by someone claiming
to be Luigi,

but who sounds suspiciously
like Jackie Chan.

Can't we make a one-time
exception for tonight?

We could.

We could also
stop using the letter "M,"

but I think that idea is
isguided and oronic.

Just come with me to Raj's.

Well, I don't want
to go to a party.

It's not a party.
It's the same group of people

who hang out here
hanging out over there.

I'm sorry, but five people
eating and chatting is a party.

How come it's not a party
when we do it here?

Because we don't
throw parties.

I don't know
what to tell you, Sheldon.

I'm going to see Priya.
Everyone's over there.

You coming or not?

Well, no, sir,
and do you know why?

In a word: tradition.

Every Thursday night
for the last eight years,

you and I and our friends
have gathered here

in this very spot to break bread
covered with cheese and sauce,

discuss the issues
of the day,

and yes, share a laugh or two.

But I guess our rich heritage
means nothing to you.

I guess you're right.

 See you later.
 Wait!

Leonard! Wait!

What am I going
to do for dinner?

Come with me to Raj's
and eat there.

I can't do that.

What if he serves haggis
and blood pudding?

I really doubt
that's what he'll serve.

But what if he does?

I'll be obliged to dine

on liver and lungs stuffed
in a sheep's stomach.

And frankly, blood pudding is
essentially the same thing.

I don't know why
he's serving both.

What do you want to do?

You want to come with me, or
do you want to sit here alone?

No, I'll go
to your haggis party.

But I'm telling you.

This is adness. This is utter
and complete adness.

 


 Oh, dear!
 What?

Raj's television.

I just realized

we're about to spend an evening
watching a plasma screen

with a cluster of dead pixels
in the upper left-hand corner.

So don't watch TV.

Read a book.

And be a social pariah?

Oh, you know
that's not my style.

Ugh!

The audible sigh is a show
of exasperation, right?

Right.

Is it about me
or the dead pixels?

Hey, you're
just in time.

We made Tex-Mex.

Oh, sounds great.

Oh, Indians
making Tex-Mex.

Might as well have had
the Chinese pizza.

Hey, you.

Hi.

That's got to be fun
for you, huh?

Watching Hofstadter
suck the saliva

out of your sister's mouth?

Excuse me. Before this evening
goes any further,

we need to decide
where everyone is going to sit.

There is no assigned seats,
Sheldon.

Just sit anywhere.
Make yourself comfortable.

Oh, what fun.

We're like hippies at a love-in.

Just sit here.

Right on, man. Right on.

Oh, look.

it's Harry Potter and 98%
of The Sorcerer's Stone.

Okay, we've
got fajitas

with all the fixins,
so you make your own.

Wonderful.

Dinner, some
assembly required.

Do you want a margarita,
Sheldon?

A margarita?!

Where are we?!
What is happening?!

Oh. Hey, Sheldon.

What can I get you?

Water. Neat.

With a little umbrella.

Where are all your friends?

Sadly, Penny, this evening,
I am the Dark Knight,

roaming these
mean streets alone.

A windbreaker for my cape,

and a stern expression
for my cowl.

Okay.

Excuse me?

Isn't this the point
where the world-weary barkeep

absentmindedly
wipes down the bar

and coaxes the woes
out of the troubled patron?

Well, I was getting your
stupid umbrella, but all right.

What's troubling you, buddy?

I don't think your heart's
in it, but since you asked...

Apparently, because
Leonard is dating Raj's sister,

we're all forced
to hang out at his apartment.

Oh, the horror.

Indeed.

Yeah, at one point,
Raj put on reggae music,

and his sister
took off her shoes.

It was like the last days
of Caligula.

Oh, I have to get this.

Umbrella?

Ugh!

Wonder
what she's exasperated about.

Hello?

Sheldon, are you all right?

When last we spoke,
you were going to

take a taxi home from Raj's,
but according to Facebook,

you just checked in
at the Cheesecake Factory.

Yes, I was in a taxi,

but the driver
didn't look at all

like the photograph
on his license,

so I leapt out and ran for it.

Wise.

There you go.

Just like recovering alcoholics
drink in the Caribbean.

Hi, bestie.

Oh. Hi, Amy.

How you been?

Fine.

From this angle,
I can see up your nose.

Yeah, it's a great time
to be alive, isn't it?

Don't worry.
My problems can wait

while you two hens
finish your clucking.

Look, Sheldon, Leonard
is dating Priya.

She is staying with Raj.

That means you're all probably
gonna be hanging out there more.

Penny, I'm sorry
you got dragged into this.

I know you're devastated

that your ex-boyfriend
has found an exciting new lover

with flawless,
caramel-colored skin.

Okay, I'm not upset
about Leonard and Priya.

Your flaring nostrils
indicate otherwise.

Cluck-cluck-cluck.

Sheldon, look at me.

I think it's time

to face the fact

that Leonard is the nucleus
of your social group.

Where he goes, the group goes.

Leonard the nucleus?

That makes no sense.

I'm the whimsical elf

that everyone looks to
for a good time.

I'm not saying
that you're not fun.

You're the most fun person
I know.

A lot of people think
I'm fun to be around.

Don't be needy, bestie.

That's probably part
of what chased Leonard away.

What I am saying, Sheldon,

is that your group
is Leonard-centric.

If it were a town,
it would be Leonardville.

If it were an Islamic nation,
Leonardstan.

If it were the birthplace
of motion pictures,

we'd all be singing
"Hooray for Leonardwood."

Ooh, I got one.

If you guys were a band,

you'd be called Leonard
and the Leonards.

So needy.

What you doing?

I'm setting out snacks.

You do realize everyone's eating
at Raj's again tonight.

I didn't say the snacks were
for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?

You're having people over?

Yes. Must be killing you
wondering who.

Fine, I'll tell you.

Stuart from the
comic bookstore,

Barry Kripke from
the university,

Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack

and TV's LeVar Burton.

Really?

LeVar Burton's coming here?

Possibly. I Tweeted him.

Okay, well, tell him
I loved him on Star Trek.

Please, Leonard, stop trying
to horn in on my new friends.

Of course. Good night.

Leonard.
Yeah?

We had a good run, you and I.

Okay.

But change is a part of life.

It certainly is.

Okay.

I have guests coming.

I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to leave now.

I am leaving.

Don't make this harder
than it is, Leonard.

Good-bye, Sheldon.

And good-bye to you, sir.

He'll be back.

Of course I'll be back.

I live here!

Well, it would appear

LeVar Burton
won't be joining us.

Let's get started.

I thought we'd begin
by going around the room,

introducing ourselves

and saying a little bit
about why we're here.

Okay.
I'm Sheldon.

Uh, for regular readers

of The New England Journal
of High Energy Physics,

I need no introduction.

If you're not familiar

with that publication,

there's a free copy
in your goody bag.

Stuart?

Um... Hi.

I'm Stuart.

I run a comic bookstore,

which for financial reasons,
I'm currently living in.

And I guess

what I'm hoping for most out
of tonight is a hot shower.

It's very
nice, Stuart.

Zack?

I'm Zack, and I'm, uh...

Uh...

Could you come back to me?

Of course.

Barry?

I'm Barry Kwipke, and I'm here

because you told me
there was going to be a whaffle.

When is the whaffle?

Patience, patience, Barry.

The whaffle...

The raffle is the grand finale

to an evening-long festival
of fun and folly.

 One more question...
 Yes, you must be present to win.

Okay, I'm ready.

I'm Zach, and I'm, uh...

Oh, crap, why is this so hard?

Oh, hey.

Hi.
Yo, P-dog.

What's up?

We're here to kidnap you

for a girls' night out.

the term "kidnap"
is being used playfully.

I kind of figured that.

Good. Now put this pillowcase
over your head.

No.

She used to be much more fun,

until Leonard punched her
in the heart.

We just thought you
might want to go out

and have a good time,
maybe go dancing.

Oh. Gee, thanks, but I'm
not really in the mood.

You do understand
that it will distract you

from obsessing
over the rich variety

of sweet loving
that your ex-boyfriend

is currently receiving
from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.

Okay, look,

if I agree to go out
with you guys,

will you promise
to stop pestering me

about Leonard and Priya?

Yes.
Sure.

All right. I'll go change.
Come on in.

If you'd have let me
bring the chloroform,

we wouldn't have had to put up
with all this jibber-jabber.

Anyway, after we
get done snowboarding,

I go back to the lodge
and get in the Jacuzzi.

There's no one around, so
naturally, I'm free-balling it.

Next thing I know,

this beautiful chick shows up,

drunk out of her skull,
wants to get in with me.

Question.

Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?

Really? That's
your question?

What's the difference?

"Jacuzzi" is a commercial brand.

"Hot tub" is the generic term.

I.E., all Jacuzzis

are hot tubs,

but not all
hot tubs are Jacuzzis.

Is that like
all thumbs are fingers,

but not all fingers are thumbs?

Surprisingly, yes.

Nice.

Now, what exactly are toes?

Can you please get back
to the drunk girl?

I'd like something to think
about in the shower.

Oh, yeah.

Right. Anyway, she takes off
all of her clothes,

climbs into the hot tub,
and the first thing I notice...

The water level rose.

No.

Of course it did.

It's said that Archimedes,

the ancient Greek mathematician,

discovered the principle
of displacement

while taking a bath.

Terrific.
Go ahead, Zack.

Naked drunk girl,
free-balling, continue.

Forgive me,
but I think you'll find

my story is
more interesting.

Does yours
have wet breasts in it?

Better.

It has a gold crown.

You see, the king

wondered how much gold was in it

and charged Archimedes with
coming up with the solution.

Because the crown was
irregularly shaped,

there was no way
to mathematically

determine its volume.

But, while bathing,
Archimedes realized

he could immerse the crown

and measure the amount
the water rose.

So, long story short,
I nailed her.

When he finished,
he shouted "Eureka!"

No, I always shout, "Holy moly!"

Don't know why.
Just do.

All right, that concludes

the "getting to know you"
portion of the evening.

Who's ready to play some
vintage video games?

And tonight's selections include

ColecoVision's "Smurf Rescue
in Gargamel's Castle,"

Atari's "Cookie Monster Munch,"

and for you
text adventure aficionados,

"Zork."

Pick me, pick me. I'm fun.

That all sucks
the big hairy meatball.

How about I go get

the karaoke machine
out of my car,

get plastered and blow
the roof off this place?

Great, I'll make a beer run.

And I'll take a shower.

We'll meet back here in 15.

Check.

I'm unhappy.

This is delicious.

Where'd you learn
to make chili?

When I was at
university in England,

my flatmate was
from Texas.

I hope she wasn't anything
like my flatmate from Texas.

Sheldon is a bit
quirky, isn't he?

Oh, please.
That crazy bastard's looking

at quirky
in the rearview mirror.

Did you know that,
per our roommate agreement,

I have to wash my feet
before I get in the shower?

And not in the sink.

We each have special buckets.

Raj, did you ever
tell your sister

about the time Sheldon
got punched by Bill Gates?

 Oh, God, you're kidding.
 Nope.

Gates gave a speech
at the university.

Sheldon went up to him
afterwards and said,

"Maybe if you weren't
so distracted

by sick children in Africa,

you could have put a little more
thought into Windows Vista."

Bam. Right in the nose.

Made me proud to own a PC.

I'd like to propose a toast

to a rare and wonderful
Sheldon-free evening.

Hear, hear.
Cheers.

You realize that's the first
time we've ever done that

without having
to listen to Sheldon tell us

why it's called a toast?

Why is it
called a toast?

Oh, the ancient Romans

put spiced toast
in their punch bowls.

Sheldon tells it better.

He kind of does.

Yeah.

Aw, hell, I miss him.

So, where do you guys
want to go dancing?

We were hoping
you'd know a place.

Yes, perhaps somewhere
packed tightly

with young, beautiful bodies

sweating and writhing
against each other

in a glorious orgy
of the flesh.

Oh, yeah, I know that place.

What do you think?

That should display enough
of your bosom

to attract a new mate,
or a hungry infant.

Okay, let's go
through this one more time.

Just because
Leonard has a new girlfriend

does not mean I need to go out
and hook up with some guy.

But you could
if you wanted to, right?

Well, yeah, I guess.

Pick out the hottest guy
in the room,

take him home,
do unspeakable things to him,

then kick him to the curb
with a smile on his face

and teeth marks on his heinie?

More or less.

What's that like?

I don't know.

It's fun while
you're doing it.

And then after,
it's mostly embarrassment,

self-loathing
and regret.

I would take that deal
all day long.

Yeah, well, it's not
gonna happen tonight.

You know, for the
first time in my life,

I am not
in a relationship,

and I'm totally
okay with it.

You know, if being on
your own is new to you,

I'd be happy to share some
tension-relieving techniques

for ladies I've perfected
over the years.

For example, do you have
an electric toothbrush?

Um, no.

You should get one.

What's that?

It appears
to be something preserved

between two pieces of acrylic.

Oh, it's a snowflake
from the North Pole.

Leonard gave it
to me last year.

Oh, God, that is so romantic.

Yeah, it was.

Leonard's really one of a kind.

Saying that
while holding a snowflake

is a bit heavy-handed,
don't you think?

Let me see that.

Oh, screw it.

I can deal with
a little self-loathing.

Let's go find me
a heinie to bite.

Outstanding.

And if we fail,
we can always stop at CVS

and pick you out
a nice toothbrush.

I call mine "Gerard."

That's kind of creepy.

 Don't go breaking
my heart 

 I couldn't
if I tried 

 Oh, honey,
if I get restless 

 Baby, you're
not that kind 

 Don't go
breaking my heart 

Anybody do "Walking
on Sunshine" yet?

No.

Dibs.

I'm sorry, Sheldon
bought a loom

and learned
how to weave?

He actually
got pretty good.

He made us
all matching serapes.

I still wear mine
when there's a nip in the air.

Now, was this before

or after he adopted
the 25 cats?

Long before the cats.

I think it was
around the time he tried

to declare our apartment
a sovereign nation.

I still have some
of the currency.

All my friends.

All my friends.

All my friends.

I think it's like Beetlejuice.

We said his name too many times.

Come on in.
Thank you.

Hey. I thought you were
with your new buddies.

I had to leave.

They were having fun wrong.

Come here, Sheldon.
Sit here with me.

Thank you.

Would you like some
homemade chili?

Are there beans in it?

Yes.

Then it's not chili.

Real chili has no beans in it,

but you're
from a foreign land,

so your ignorance
is forgiven.

Sheldon, do you want some
or not?

Yes, please.

Your girlfriend's a
little short-tempered.

I'd like
to propose a toast

to friends,
no matter how quirky.

Cheers.

Priya, do you know
why this is called a toast?

Actually, I do.

I believe the Romans
used to put spiced toast

in their punch bowls.

She's also a bit
of a know-it-all.

Mmm. This is good.

Whatever it is.

 I'm walking on sunshine 

 Whoa 
 Whoa 

 I'm walking on sunshine 

 Whoa 
 Whoa 

Hello? I...

 I'm walking on sunshine 

 Whoa 
 Whoa 

Oh, I don't think so.

I am so done with Twitter.



Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

My brother...

he's got a big crush on Bernadette.

You're moving back to India?

What's going on?


It's not what it looks like.


What does it look like?

It's not what it looks like.

What are you grinding about?

Penny's brain teaser this morning.

She and Koothrappali
emerge from your bedroom.

She is disheveled
and Raj is dressed only in a sheet.

The sole clue:
It's not what it looks like.

Tsk, just let it go, Sheldon.

If I could, I would,
but I can't, so I shan't.

Now...

knowing Penny, the obvious answer is
they engaged in coitus.

But since that's what it looks like,
we can rule that out.

Let's put on our thinking caps,
shall we?

Raj is from India, a tropical country,
third-world hygiene...

parasitic infections are common,
such as pinworms.

 Mm-hm.
 The procedure for diagnosing pinworms...

is to wait until the subject is asleep...

and the worms crawl out of the rectum
for air.

Yes, just like that.

Penny could have been inspecting
Raj's anal region for parasites.

Oh, boy, that's a true-blue friend.

They slept together, Sherlock.


No, you weren't listening.

She said, "it's not what it looks like."

She lied.

Oh.

Now don't I look silly
sitting here wearing this?

 Hey.
 Hey.

Hey.

Leonard, is it awkward for you...

knowing one of your dear friends
had sexual intercourse...

with a woman you used to love
in the very place you lay your head?

No, I'm fine with it.

That sounds like sarcasm.

But I'm gonna disregard it
because I have an agenda. Paintball.

Specifically, the interdepartmental
tournament this weekend.

Now, in order to function better
as a fighting unit...

I thought we should establish
a chain of command.

Now, it goes without saying
that I would outrank the three of you.

But the question remains,
by how much?

Now, I don't see me
as some four-star general back at HQ...

riding a desk and playing golf
with the Secretary of Defense.

But I also can't be Sergeant Cooper
because that might lead you...

to think of me as a regular Joe. This
might take some thought. As you were.

 What the hell is wrong with you?
 How could you do that?

 What is it to you?
 I got his back.

Yeah, right.
You're jealous because...

I'm Penny's number-two choice
after Leonard.

Hey, if I wasn't engaged to Bernadette,
that totally could have been me.

Please. Sheldon would've
been before you...

and he might not even
have genitals.

Why do you care so much?
You're dating my sister...

and Penny and I are in love.

 What, heh?
 What?

Gentlemen, if I may interject.

I've decided my rank will be captain.

If it's good enough for Kirk,
Crunch and Kangaroo...

it's good enough for me.

 You're not in love with Penny.
 Yes, I am.

The god Kamadeva has shot us
with his flowery arrows of love.

 Who?
 He's the Hindu version of Cupid...

but way better
because he rides a giant parrot.

Raj, come on, you fall in love
with any girl who smiles at you.

A month ago, you were writing poems
about his fiancée.

I'm sorry, what?

Rubbish. He's talking rubbish.

Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet

That could have been about anyone.

You have nothing to worry about,
because now I'm the dusky half...

of Koothrapenny.

For the record, I do have genitals.

They're functional
and aesthetically pleasing.


Oh. Coming.

Yup, that's good.

Wine glasses should have handles.

Keeping accurate track
of your alcohol intake.

Smart idea, considering how trampy
you get when you've had a few.

You heard what I did?

 Well, I heard who you did.
 Ugh.

Oh, my God, I screwed up everything.

I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj.
I mean, what is wrong with me?

I feel like two totally different people.

Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.

Don't be so hard on yourself.

 Know the story of Catherine the Great?
 No.

She ruled Russia in the late 1700s, and
one night when she was feeling randy...

she used an intricate system of pulleys
to have intimate relations with a horse.

I'm sorry,
what does this have to do with me?

She engaged
in inter-species hanky-panky...

and people still call her great.

I'm sure your reputation can survive
you shagging a little Indian boy.


You jerk-face!

What did you tell Howard?

You say there's something going on
between us? He thinks there is.

He's completely freaking out!

Please, come in.

What the hell is wrong with you?

You were always so nice to me,
I thought maybe you liked me.

I'm nice to everyone!

 I'm sorry.
 Damn right, you're sorry.

And you tell Howard
there's never been anything between us.

I will. Hey, Bernadette.

 What?
 Do you think I have a shot with Penny?

Of course, you do. You're a cutie pie.
Any girl would be lucky to have you.

You know, I've done this before.

In kindergarten, I was supposed
to marry Jason Sorensen...

but by the time my class got out there,
he was engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb.

What did I do? Hung upside down
from the monkey bars...

let all the boys see my underpants.

You can't blame yourself.

When your pre-frontal cortex fails
to make you happy...

promiscuity rewards you
with dopamine.

We neurobiologists refer to this
as the skank reflex.

 You know what? Let's get out of here.
 Where are we going?

Somewhere
where no one's seen me naked.

We may have to drive a while.

Subtlety isn't her strong suit, is it?

Oh, can I stay at your place
for a few nights?

Really? A best-friend sleepover? Yay.

Yeah, sure. Yay, heh.

We'll make popcorn, stay up all night,
and I'll teach you my secret language.


 Sounds great.
 Nope. Sounds:


 Yeah, I'm gonna go pack a bag.
 No, you're not. You're gonna:


Do we really have to wear
this camouflage crap to play paintball?

Who said that? Leonard,
I can hear your voice, but I can't see you.

I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.

Oh, there you are.

Leonard, I know you're upset
about recent events...

and I have someone here to help.

I don't wanna talk to Amy.

Yeah... No, it's not Amy.

Hello, dear.

You called my mother?

Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary
to caption the obvious?

He's been like that
since he was a toddler.

"Look, Mommy, a butterfly."

Maddening.

What's going on?
What do you want?

Sheldon informed me that you're
experiencing an emotional upheaval...

and I'm here to help.

That's so nice.

And we're back to the obvious.

Now, what's up?

Well, uh...

Okay, um...

I don't wanna get back with Penny.

We tried it, it was crazy, it didn't work.

But I can't deal with the fact
that she slept with my friend, Raj.

And then I find out
that Raj's sister, Priya...

who I've been going out with,
is moving back to India.

So I'm just completely confused
and alone.

I understand.

 Got any advice?
 Yes. Buck up.

Excuse me,
you're a world-renowned expert...

in parenting and child development,
and all you've got is "buck up"?

Sorry.

Buck up, sissy pants.

 Thanks, Mother, I feel better.
 If you need any more help...

my books are available on Amazon.

Logging off.

Ninety-nine...

100.

It's like a waterfall of liquid gold.

My turn.



Don't know what the point of staying
in L.A. is.

I haven't gotten a single acting job
since I moved out here.

The closest I came was last month. I got
a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.

Oh, I could so see you
being the face of hemorrhoids.

I know, right?

Ugh, maybe I should just move back
to Nebraska.

 No, I can't let you do that.
 Why not?


For the first time ever,
I have a thriving social life.

And no pressure,
but it kind of lives and dies with you.

Hi, Amy, can I talk to Penny?

A guest in my trundle bed
and a boy at my door?

I wish I could tell 13-year-old me
it does get better.

 How did you know I was here?
 It's all over her Facebook page.

 I'll take your stuff and clear a drawer.
 All right, thanks.

No problem.
Try and keep it in your pants, okay?

So...

Hi, what's up?

Wondering if you're free Friday.
They're having '80s night at the Greek.

Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves,
and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.

Oh, heh.

 That's really sweet, but the thing is...
 Oh, there's a thing.

Look, honey, I was really drunk
and made a huge mistake last night.

We should have never slept together.
It's what ruins friendships.

You can't ruin a friendship with sex.

That's like trying to ruin ice cream
with chocolate sprinkles.

Come here. Just...

Listen to me. I...

I wanna go back
to the way we were before.

You know, friends.

No sprinkles.

Oh.

 All right.
 Thank you.


Well, uh...


as your friend,
you might like to know that, um...

we didn't have sex
in the conventional sense.

Oh, God, did you pull
some weird Indian crap on me?

No, no.

After we got undressed
and jumped in bed...

you asked if I had protection.

 Oh, you did, didn't you?
 Well, of course. I'm always packing.

Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on...

and you tried to help, and...

That was all she wrote.

 So we didn't actually...
 I did. It was beautiful.

Oh.

Penny, promise me
you won't tell anybody about this.

 Of course, I won't.
 Oh, good.


And, uh, can I tell people that our love
burned too bright and too quickly?

Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?

 Sure.
 Oh, good.

It fell apart because you're all,
"I wanna have your babies"...

and I was like:
"I'm too rock 'n' roll to be tied down"?

No.

Can I say I ruined you for white men?

Also no.

 Okay, just the candle thing.
 Yeah.

Cool.

All right.

 Friend.
 Hmm.

 I'll see you around.
 Okay.

Raj, wait.

Thank you for being my friend.

 Penny.
 Mm-hm.

It's getting beautiful again.

All right. This is a Google Earth view
of the field of battle.

 I don't see anything.
 Give it a second to load.

Whenever you're ready, AT&T.

Okay, here we go. This is us, here.

To the south is Professor Loomis
and the Geology Department.

According to their Twitter feed,
they're out of sunblock...

which means they'll have
to hug the tree line or risk melanoma.

That's our edge. All we have to do
is move quickly over this ridge.

The rock-worshipping, pasty-faced
bastards won't know what hit them.

Let's move out.

Hang on, Sheldon.

How could you not tell me
your sister was moving back to India?

Maybe he was busy
writing clumsy penis metaphors...

about my fiancée.

Screw you. That was
a beautifully-written penis metaphor.

You know what?
Guys, I'm not in the mood for paintball.

 What do you say we just bag it?
 Fine.

 Sure, whatever.
 But you can't quit.

That's a court-martial offense.
That's punishable by...

You can't quit.

I'm sorry, Sheldon, it's just
not a good time for playing games.

This is a game to you?

Uh, was the Battle of Antietam
a game, huh?

Was the Sack of Rome a game?

Yes, no and no.

Wait.

I just want you all to know
that I forgive you.

This mutiny isn't your fault.

It's mine.

I haven't earned these bars.

Although what I lack in leadership,
I more than make up for in sewing.

Let it go, Sheldon. I'll get you
a Jamba Juice on the way home.

No. Jamba Juice is for heroes.

And that's what we're going to be.

What are you doing?

Following in the footsteps
of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.

Geology isn't a real science.


 Damn those sons of bitches!


If there's ever a church of Sheldon,
this will be when it started.

Ow!

I'd like to propose a toast
to the man whose noble sacrifice...

inspired our victory,
Captain Sheldon Cooper.

 Cheers!
 Excuse me, it's Major Sheldon Cooper.

With my last breath, I awarded myself
a battlefield promotion.

It's kind of a big deal.


Hi. You guys have a minute?

 Uh, yeah, sure.
 Okay, um...


Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted
to apologize to the rest of you...

for, you know, everything.

Please, Penny, let me.


We've decided to let our crazy,
wonderful night together...

be just one
of those memories you have...

and can call to mind when you're
feeling blue or you're in the shower.

Hey, what you doing, quick draw?

Sorry. Go on.


Anyways, I wanted you to know that I've
been taking a really hard look at things...

and come to the conclusion
I have to stop kidding myself.

I suck at acting.

It's time for me
to move back to Nebraska.

 You're leaving?
 Yeah.

What are you gonna do in Nebraska?

I don't know. Maybe teach acting.


Sorry. Hold on. Hello?

I hope you're not doing this
because of you and me...

because I have a girlfriend
and you're a single...

Shh! It's my agent. It's my agent.
You're kidding.

Oh, my gosh. I can't believe it.
Really?

Oh, I'm so excited. Thank you.

Thank you so much. Okay, bye.

I got the hemorrhoid commercial.
I start Monday.

What about Nebraska?

Oh, hell with Nebraska.
I'm gonna be a star.



Have you ever thought
of teaching physics?

Ready to ride?

I don't think so, Mom.

Not today.

Oh, sweetie.

Hemorrhoids acting up again?

You don't know the half of it.

Oh, yes, I do.

Try a dab of this.

"Rose-scented Preparation-H
for women?"

Now, the H is for her.

 I'm proud of you.
 Shh. Here comes my joke.

How you doing?

Sitting pretty.



Smell that?

That's the smell of new comic books.

They're on me today, boys.

You're paying?

Have you been selling
your sperm again?

No, I'm celebrating.

As we speak,
the space shuttle is docking

at the International Space Station

where it will deploy the Wolowitz
Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.

Get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.

Just think. Thanks to your hard work,
an international crew of astronauts

will "boldly go
where no man has gone before."

 Is that supposed to be funny?
 I believe it is.

The combination of
the Star Trek reference

and the play on words involving
the double-meaning of the verb "to go"

suggests that Leonard is mocking
your efforts in space plumbing.

Okay, make your little jokes,

but of the four of us,
I'm the only one making

any real-world contribution
to science and technology.

He's right. This is an important
achievement, for two reasons.

Number one...

and, of course, number two!

Clever!

Playing on the use
of cardinal numbers

as euphemisms for bodily functions.

Here, Sheldon,
I pulled the new Hellboy for you.

It's mind-blowing.

Excuse me.

Spoiler alert.

I didn't spoil anything.

You told me it's mind-blowing.

So, my mind is going into it
pre-blown.

And once a mind is pre-blown,
it cannot be re-blown.

I'm sorry.

Said the Grinch to Christmas.

 Can I talk to you about something?
 What's up?

Remember I went out with Penny,
a couple weeks ago?

 Yeah, vaguely.
 Sure you remember.

You went to the bar
and made a fool of yourself

trying to pick up strange women.

What about it?

The thing is,
the date didn't go that well.

Too bad.

I guess the thing to do now
is just pick yourself up,

dust yourself off,
forget it and move on.

 I can't do that.
 Why the hell not?

'Cause we're going out
again tomorrow.

Excuse me, Stuart.

Have you read the new Flash?

Well, I have
and it will knock your socks off!

Good luck getting them back on.

This is probably my last shot with Penny
and I don't want to screw it up.

Nobody wants that.

So, here's my question:
It's the second date,

you think she'll be expecting things

to get physical?

Gee...

My initial reaction is "no,"

but let me think about it
and get back to you.

So, you'll give me a call?

 Yeah, or you call me.
 Great.

Or nobody calls anyone.

Interesting.

Penny's current suitor asking advice
from her former suitor.

You know, thanks
for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.

Hey, wanna make sure
he gets nowhere with Penny

without jeopardizing your friendship
with either of them?

I'm listening.

Just tell him to do everything
you've done with her

for the last two years.

Subtitles: The FW Team

 How's it going?
 Good, good. You?

Fine.

Can I ask you something?

Sure.

You know your friend Stuart?

He asked me out again
and I said yes,

and then I started thinking
maybe I should talk to you first.

About what?

Does it bother you,
me going out with one of your friends?

'Cause you know, you and me...

No, that's the past.

I'm really more
of a "right now" kind of guy.

You know, living in the moment.

Although I do have to live a little
in the future, 'cause that's my job.

Of course, my fondness
for classic science fiction

does draw my attention backwards,

but those stories often
take place in the future.

In conclusion, no,
it doesn't bother me.

Okay, well,
that's really cool of you.

I wouldn't say cool.
I'd just say... "That's Leonard!"

In that case,
do you mind giving me some advice?

About Stuart?

Love to.

He's very shy.

How do I make him feel
more comfortable around me?

First of all, don't underestimate
the value of discomfort.

Really?

Stuart thrives under pressure.

That's why he works in
a comic book store.

It's Stuart.

You're not going to answer it?

He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't want to talk about Penny.

You're making an assumption.

Perhaps the comic book store
is on fire.

And he needs your assistance.

Why would he call me?

We don't know.

And if you don't answer the phone,
we can't know.

I'm not answering the phone.

Answer the phone, Leonard.

There, it went to voice mail.

Aren't you going to check
your messages?

You have to check your messages!

The living of a message
is one half of a social contract

which is completed by the
checking of the message.

If that contract breaks down,

then all social contracts break down
and we descend into anarchy.

It must be hell inside your head.

At times.

Guys, we have a code red.

"Code Red" the hospital emergency alert,
the computer worm,

or the cherry-flavored soft drink
from the makers of Mountain Dew?

Look, I was going over the schematics
on my zero-G toilet,

and I made a teeny tiny mistake

on the specifications
for the diverter valve.

How teeny tiny?

It's gonna fail
after about ten flushes.

 But the mission is for six months.
 See, that's the code red.

It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.

No one knows exactly when,
but at some point

something way worse than a puppet
is gonna pop out of that box.

Have you notified NASA?

Are you crazy?
What am I gonna say?

"I screwed up your toilet
and there's gonna be crap floating

"all over your nice
shiny space station"?

What are you gonna do?

I'm gonna figure out how to fix it,
then I'll tell them.

So, what do you need us for?

He can't figure out how to fix it.

You said you were
gonna be supportive.

I'm trying, but you have to admit
this is pretty damn funny.

I agree.

It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech
nature of space exploration

against the banality
of a malfunctioning toilet

that provides the comic fodder here.

Check your messages.

All right,
this is an exact duplicate

of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Disposal System

as deployed on the
International Space Station.

Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Distribution System?

Good one.

It's hilarious. Now...

Here's an approximation

of the spare parts
available on the Space Station.

We gotta find a way,
using nothing but this,

to reinforce this so the waste material
avoids the spinning turbine.

You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?

I have to say,

I thought the toilet humor would
get less funny with repetition.

Apparently, there is no law

of diminishing comedic returns
with space poop.

You busy?

Classified, Leonard.

Yeah, it's a regular
Manhattan Project.

What's up?

Tonight's my date with Penny

and since we haven't been able
to connect by phone...

I'm sorry, it's been broken.

 Or e-mail.
 Yeah, that too. Everything's broken.

Anyway, I was just wondering
if you had any last-minute advice.

All right, well,
off the top of my head,

I think the most important thing
with Penny is to go really slow.

I mean, glacial.

Guys come onto her all the time,
so, you need to set yourself apart.

Be a little shy,

don't make too much eye contact.

And, you know, treat her
with, like, cool detachment

and-and, you know, fear.

 Fear?
 Yeah, like,

you're afraid
that if you touch her, she'll break.

Well, that plays
right into my wheelhouse.

Good, good.
You kids have fun tonight.

Thanks, Leonard.

What is that thing anyway?

You don't know what this is?

Good. Get out.

Be afraid of Penny.

Nice. Very crafty.

It wasn't bad advice.
It's just wasn't particularly helpful.

For what it's worth, my mother says

that when we deceive
for personal gain,

we make Jesus cry.

All right, what if we use
this two-inch PVC

 to reinforce the center cross-support?
 No good.

It might work for the Japanese
and the Americans,

but have you seen the size
of the Russians they got up there?

This thing has to hold up
against a hearty potato-based diet.

I feel terrible.

Maybe if you were helping,
you'd feel better about yourself.

I deliberately tried
to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.

Of course you feel terrible.
You completely screwed up your karma.

You don't really believe
in that superstition, do you?

It's not superstition.
It's practically Newtonian.

For every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

Leonard pretends to be a friend
and acts like a two-faced bitch.

Therefore, he is reborn
as a banana slug.

It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.

Speaking of what goes around
comes around...

Okay, look.

Instead of trying to reinforce
this structure here,

what if we just ran another line,
bypass it entirely?

It won't work. The diameter
of the tubing is insufficient.

What if we reposition
the collection tank?

It won't work. No way to mount it.

Okay, here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live

with my cousin and her husband, Avi,
in Israel?

That could work.

 Morning.
 Morning. What's up?

Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter
trying to fix a zero-gravity...

pasta maker.

I'm gonna make a coffee run.
Do you want any?

No, thanks. I have coffee.

Great. So how'd it go
with Stuart last night?

I really don't want
to talk about it.

Yeah. Right. Sure.

The thing is,
before you guys went out,

I spoke to him and...

I said I don't want
to talk about it.

I just... I kind of...

What goes on between me and Stuart
is none of your business.

So just leave it alone, okay?

If you want to clean up your karma,
go get my freakin' latte.

Hang on, I think I've got this.
Help me see if we can wedge

this little piece of PVC
behind the support rod.

You're overestimating
the tensile strength

of the substructure you're building.

Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.

If you knew what you were doing,
there wouldn't be a space toilet

where my coffee table should be.

Howard, wait.

Why don't you use this
instead of the PVC

to keep the transverse
filter assembly in place?

Because this is not a spare part
from the space station.

This is the thing from the pizza box

that keeps the lid
from touching the cheese.

That what that's for?
In India, the lid touches the cheese.

Of course, we also have rampant poverty
and periodic outbreaks of cholera,

so a little cardboard in our cheese
is no biggie.

 Where are you going?
 Comic book store.

An excellent idea!
I could certainly use a break.

 Me, too.
 You can go to the comic book store

when man can once again
safely poop in space.

Why does Leonard get to go?

'Cause he's upset
over his situation with Penny

and if I have to hear about it again,
I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.

 Thanks for understanding, Howard.
 I got your back, sister.

All right, I think we've got
a prototype ready to test.

Hand me that Tupperware.

That's heavy.

Damn right it's heavy.
It's my mother's meat loaf.

It's been testing toilets
for generations.

I must say,

I think a detailed letter to MIT
describing your current circumstances

might entitle you
to a refund on your master's degree.

Okay, simulated zero-gravity
human waste disposal test

with meat loaf analog in...

three, two, one.

Fascinating.

What do you think the problem is?

Not enough bread crumbs.

Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.

 Sure, what's up?
 I gave you bad advice about Penny,

 and I want to apologize.
 No, your advice was great.

 It was?
 Yeah, going slow really worked.

You're kidding.

Never worked for me.

Last night at dinner,
I did what you told me.

I went really slow,
I kept my distance,

and two bottles of wine later,
we were making out in my car.

Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

It doesn't matter,
that's where it all went to hell.

During the kissing?

What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.

No, everything was good
and really hot.

And I said,

"Oh, Penny,"

and right where she was supposed to say,
"Oh, Stuart," she said...

your name.

That is your name, right?

I'm sorry. That must've been
the last thing you wanted to hear.

It beats,
"You know I'm a dude, right?"

Yeah, it was pretty bad.

No doubt, no doubt.

I'm sorry it didn't work out.

Not your fault.

Yeah, how about that?

 See you soon.
 Sure.

Yes, sir, I understand "classified."

We'll keep it all classified;
no one has to know but you and me.

What's classified?

Howard's space toilet.
I'll tell you later.

Well, they've deployed our solution.

Let's just all hope it works.

I don't see why I have to worry.

My career's not hanging
in the balance.

That was a joke.

It's funny,

because it's true.

Leonard, could you pass
the soy sauce, please?

I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

Yeah, I said "Leonard."

Yes, you did, didn't you?

What the hell is that?

Meatloaf.

What was it doing on the ceiling?

That's classified.

Houston,
International Space Station.

We have a little situation up here.

We'd like to make
an unscheduled space walk.

I.S.S., Houston.

Which crew members would be
involved in this E.V.A.?

Houston, we'd all like
to step outside for a few minutes.

I.S.S., I'm afraid
we can't authorize that.

Houston,
this is more of an FYI call.

We are basically out the door.



I must say, Penny,
this is great fun.

Glad you're
enjoying yourself.

Until I met you and Bernadette,
my trips to the bathroom

had been entirely focused
on elimination.

Now they have a delightful
social aspect.

Amy, you must've been
in the bathroom

with other women before.

Of course I have.

But they were strangers
and seemed off-put

when I engaged in friendly
stall-to-stall chit-chat.

Some women don't
like to get chummy

when their panties are down.

You okay in there, bestie?

I'm fine...

The reason I ask is
that many people

experience bladder shyness;

the inability to pass uri...

Yeah, I said I'm fine.
Stop talking to me.

She always this crabby
when she urinates?

We're really not that close.

Screw it.
I'll go later.

And I'll be right
by your side.

Did I tell you
Priya invited

me and Howard to have dinner
with her and Leonard?

Oh, that's nice.

No, it's not.

It's a strategic maneuver.

Leonard's new girlfriend is
testing Bernadette's loyalty

to you and the group.

That bitch is crafty.

 You think?
 Of course.

How does the cheetah attack
a herd of wildebeests?

By going after
its weakest member.

Well, what makes me
the weakest member?

Your trusting nature coupled
with your teeny-tiny body.

You wouldn't last a minute
on the Serengeti.

Okay, Amy,
you're being silly.

I'm not concerned about
who hangs out with who.

And I certainly
don't have a problem

with Leonard's new girlfriend
who wears way too much makeup.

Ooh, these are cute.

Of course if I buy them,

I'll have to rent
my womb out to a gay couple.

It doesn't matter. I'm going to
tell her we can't make it.

Oh, no. You have to go.

I don't understand.

I thought I was
a teeny-tiny wildebeest.

You are-- with hair
that smells like strawberries.

And we're going to use that
to our advantage.

Wait. What are you
talking about?

By accepting the invitation,
Bernadette becomes

a double agent
inside the enemy camp.

She could ferret out
Priya's tactics,

identify her weaknesses

and feed her false
information, such as:

Leonard's no stranger
to back-alley cockfights.

I don't know.
I'm not a very good liar.

They kind of whup that
out of you in Catholic school.

Don't worry.
I'll teach you.

I did two years
of Cub Scouts

before they found
out I was a girl.

Okay, I don't
know you people.

I'm just an innocent
woman wondering

if this shoe store will
take my Texaco card.

How do you feel about
concealing a recording device

in the cleavage of
your ample bosom?

I don't want anything
in my ample bosom.

Come on, Strawberries.
Take one for the team.

 


 Okay, see you later.
 Good news.

I finally have a handle on my
idea for three-person chess.

That is good news. Bye.

Uh, do you know
how I solved

the balanced center
combat-area problem?

Five words:

transitional quadrilateral
to triangular tessellation.

That... that's brilliant.

It's what I do.

But wait, there's more.

I also invented
two new chess pieces.

The serpent...
and the old woman.

Okay, now I have to ask.
What do they do?

When the serpent slithers
to an opposing player's piece,

that piece
is considered poisoned

and will die
after two more moves.

All right.

Unless... it gets to
the old woman in time,

in which case
she sucks out the poison,

turning her into
the Grand Empress:

a piece combining the power

of the knight, queen
and serpent.

Elegant.

That's because it's simple.

Okay, well, I look forward
to playing with you.

And...

And what?

And a third person.

It's three-person chess.

I must say,
ever since you started

having regular intercourse, your
mind has lost its keen edge.

You should reflect on that.

Excuse me, but Einstein had
a pretty busy sex life.

Yes, and he never unified
gravity with the other forces.

If he hadn't been
such a hound dog,

we'd all have time machines.

Got it. Bye.

You know I'm right.

I think he's getting worse.

Oh, my metatarsal are barking.

 You okay?
 Yeah, yeah.

I'm just breaking in
some new shoes.

 Very pretty.
 Thank you.

Did you know that women
wear high heels

to make the buttocks
and breasts more prominent?

Hadn't really thought about it.

Look.

Uh, sure. Very... prominent.

Please, Leonard, don't leer,
you have a girlfriend.

 Sorry.
 So, are you off to dinner

with Priya, Howard
and Bernadette?

Yeah. How did you know?

I heard it at the mall,

when I was shopping
with my girlfriends,

'cause, you know,
that's kind of my life now.

Have a good night.

Try not to ogle my caboose
as I walk away.

 Hey, you.
 Hi.

Hey, Raj, will you
be joining us for dinner?

The lonely guy
and the two happy couples?

I'd rather get a prostate exam

from a leper who walks away
with nine fingers.

Oh, would you please stop
feeling sorry for yourself?

I have to feel sorry for myself.
I'm the only one who cares.

Just like I'm the only one
who'll have sex with me.

Really? In front
of your sister?

We shared a room growing up.
This is not news to me.

Excuse me. I'm going to go
wander the streets alone.

Invisible, unwanted and unloved;

a pathetic shadow
in a city with no heart.

I forgot my windbreaker.
It's chilly.

I don't understand. Is this
a way to break in new shoes?

No. Once these puppies
touch the ground

they're mine,
and I'll have to wear them

walking up and down
Hollywood Boulevard

in order to pay them off.

Pretty, pretty, pretty.

Good news: the wildebeest
is in the curry.

The what?

Bernadette is with
Priya and Leonard.

Message received.

Commence operation
"Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya."

Hey. Seriously?

Didn't you get enough of this
cliquey crap in high school?

I wish. A clique
requires friends.

 I didn't have any.
 None?

I used to take my lunch
down to the maintenance room

and eat with the janitor.

It was nice until his wife
called me a puta

and made me stop.

Hang on.

It's the wildebeest.

Priya just made a snide comment
about your acting career.

W-What the hell did she say?

She thinks it's cool
you're following your dream,

no matter what.

That bitch!

How do you want
to handle it?

Um, okay.

Tell Bernadette to tell Priya
that I'm on my way to Prague

to shoot a movie
with Angelina Jolie.

Got it.

Is it going
to be in 3-D?

What? I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

I'm gonna say 3-D.

That'll let her know
the studio has faith in it.

You're kidding. 3-D?

That's what I hear.

Then the studio
must have real faith in it.

Wonder why she
didn't tell me.

Have you been spending time
with your ex-girlfriend?

No...

Then why are you surprised
she didn't tell you?

Well, it's not as much
"surprised" as

you know...
uh... the other thing.

What other thing?

Well, if you... uh...

I don't... oh...

What's the word I'm looking for?

I'm not going to help you.
This is hilarious.

She's also dating an astronaut.

Wow. That's very impressive.

Yeah. But Leonard's
impressive, too.

Thank you.

"Befuddled."

The word I was looking for
was "befuddled."

Knight to old woman...

six-and-a-third.

Brilliant move.

Thank you.

Will the two of you excuse me?

I need a hug.

Sorry, I have company.

Come on, Sheldon, open the door.

I don't want to hug you.

I don't want to
hug you, either.

I was just
feeling blue.

Blue, as in depressed.

Well, not so much
depressed as lonely.

I don't know what
color lonely is.

 What?
 Red is angry;

yellow is frightened;

green is jealous;
and blue is depressed.

Perhaps we can assign
a color to lonely.

Nothing rhymes with orange.
It's probably lonely.

All right. Come in.

You look positively
orange with loneliness.

No, I don't see that
catching on at all.

What are you doing?

I'm working on my
three-person chess game.

Oh, cool. Can I play?

It's three-person chess.

Did you bring a friend?

No.

Then as a mental exercise
I invite you

to figure out why the two of us
can't play three-person chess.

Can you believe this guy?

Social protocol does, however,

require me to bring you
a hot beverage

in your time of need.

No, thank you. I'm fine.

It's not optional.

We're out of tea.
I hope you like bouillon.

I, uh, I guess you're probably
wondering what's got me down.

Actually, I was wondering

if I could add
a third new chess piece.

How do you think people
would feel about Prince Joey--

the king's feeble-minded
but well-meaning cousin?

I'm going to be 30 years old,

and I have no one in my life
to love me.

I'm such a basket case, I can't
even talk to a woman

without having alcohol
in my body.

The fun thing about
Prince Joey

is every time he moves,
there's a one-in-five chance

he'll kill himself.

Sheldon, listen to me.

I have a big decision to make,
and I'm scared.

Yellow. Go ahead.

A friend at the School
of Pharmacology

gave me these new pills
they're testing.

He says it's
the next big thing

for social anxiety disorder.

Fascinating.
What's in it?

I'm not sure.

Some sort of beta-blocker
attached to a molecule

extracted from
the urine of cows.

I like cows.

That's not the point.

It was its own
point. Go on.

I'm a scientist.

My ability to think
is my bread and butter.

I'm afraid if I take this,
I might lose

that special, unique something that
makes me so successful in my field.

Rajesh, I've had
the privilege

of working alongside
you for many years.

My recommendation is that you
gobble these up like Tic Tacs.

Okay, I'm still trying
to work this out.

How did Penny meet an astronaut?

I don't know.

The regular way
people meet astronauts.

Most of those
guys live in Texas.

Obviously, this one doesn't.

Okay.

Leonard lives here.
Priya's from India.

People meet, Howard.
God!

Fine.

You've met lots of astronauts,

and I've never grilled you
about that.

I'd thank you to extend me
the same courtesy.

I'm not grilling you;
I was just curious.

I still can't get over the fact
that she got a big movie part.

Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's
up to, 'cause I don't.

Maybe that's where she met
the astronaut, all right?

I'm sorry. What would an
astronaut be doing

working on a movie?

He's a consultant.

I thought the movie was
about 18th-century Vienna.

He can't have a hobby?!

Excuse me, I have to pee.

Or is that
implausible, as well?!

It's nice to have another
couple to hang with, isn't it?

All right, guys,
you have to go back.

I can't afford you.

No, don't send
us away; we love you.

I love you, too,
but you cost more than my rent.

But, Penny,
you look so good in us.

Damn it, the shoes are right.

Good golly, Penny,
your whimsy is boundless.

What do you got for me,
wildebeest?

I think they're on to me.

The story's starting
to fall apart.

Calm down.
Everything's going to be okay.

We may have
to kill her.

Bernadette, I'm putting
you on speakerphone.

Where are you now?

In the bathroom.

Oh, look at this, another one of
our classic bathroom gabfests.

What's the problem?

They're just asking me

all sorts of questions
I can't answer.

Just change the subject.

I suppose I could get them back
to talking about Leonard

going to India
to meet Priya's parents.

What?!

They said something about
going there this summer.

What, are they getting engaged?

I don't know. I was too busy
covering my heinie

on Amy's stupid
astronaut story!

What astronaut story?

You texted me Penny's
dating an astronaut.

I texted "architect."
That's amusing.

Auto-correct
must've changed it.

Yeah, it's hysterical.

All right, look, just forget
about the astronaut.

Architect. Where would you
have met an astronaut?

Look, just find out what's up
with this trip to India.

I don't want
to do this anymore!

Don't you quit on us!

Bernie, you okay?

It was an architect!

Thank you for coming
with me, Sheldon.

You're a good friend.

I'm glad you think so.

That's what I
strive to emulate.

Okay, let's see
if this drug works.

Can I help you?

Forgive me for staring,
but you're very beautiful.

Thank you.

That's a great accent.
Where are you from?

India.

Oh, cool.
I've always wanted to go there.

It's a beautiful country.
You'd love it.

May I join you?

Uh, okay, sure.
Why not?

My name is Dr. Rajesh
Koothrappali,

and this is my friend
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Hi.

There's no need
to interact with me.

I'm just here to observe.

What's he
observing?

We're scientists.
We observe everything.

Here, go buy yourself a scone.

All right.

 And what is your name?
 Angela.

Oh, derived from the word
"angel." Appropriate.

You're cute.

I'd like to buy a scone.

Oh, I'm sorry, we're out.

We have muffins.

They sound delicious,

but this money
is earmarked for scones.

What are
you doing?!

Oh, just getting comfortable.

So how long have you
lived in Los Angeles?

I...

They were out of scones.

Sheldon, I'm talking to someone.

You're being rude.

I'll bet you're an actress.

If not, you should be.

You have a very expressive face.

Oh, my God.

Wait, where are you going?

We were doing so well.

She never even got
to see my penis.

Ta-da!

Who wants some
more coffee?

Thanks, yeah.
Sure.

Let me help you.

Nice to see that the gals
are getting along.

"Gals"?

Who are you, Fred Flintstone?

This trip to India
sounds fun.

Yeah, I think it will be.

Are you concerned your parents
might not approve of Leonard?

A little.

They're very old-fashioned.

Well, I wouldn't
worry about it.

It's not like you guys
are getting engaged, right?

Oh, God, no.
We're not there yet.

Not engaged.
Very interesting.

I have to tinkle.

You've been in there
a lot tonight. Are you okay?

Yes.
Are you writing a book?

Why are you getting upset?

I'm not upset.
Maybe you're upset.

What's up with you?

Bernadette?

I can't do this anymore!

I'm a good girl!

I went to Catholic school!

Okay, well, it's getting late.

This was terrific.

You win.

Bernie?

I think the word you're
looking for is "befuddled."

My catapult flings my bishop

to Howard's Queen's Gorilla two.

Nice.

Okay, rook to transporter pad.

And he comes out at...

Leonard's Queen's Bishop
five-and-a-third.

Check on Leonard.

Hang on.

When is my pawn allowed
to use the golf cart?

When it's done charging.

Or you land on
the time machine.

Obviously.

Oh, oh...

Beekeeper to King 12.

I capture your pope
and release the swarm.

Checkmate on Sheldon.

I knew I should've given
my pope the jet pack.

Hey, I've got winners.



Here's the problem with teleportation.

Lay it on me.

Assuming a device could be invented...

which would identify the state of matter
of an individual in one location...

and transmit that to a distant location
for reassembly...

you wouldn't have
transported the individual...

you would have destroyed him in one
location and re-created him in another.

How about that.

I would never use a transporter.

The original Sheldon
would have to be disintegrated...

in order to create a new Sheldon.

Would the new Sheldon be in any way
an improvement on the old Sheldon?

No, he would be exactly the same.

That is a problem.

So you see it too?

Dr. Hofstadter, Dr. Cooper.

Dr. Gablehauser.

Gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim.

Dennis is a highly sought-after
doctoral candidate.

We're hoping to have him
do graduate work here.

 Graduate work, very impressive.
 And he's only 15 years old.

Not bad.
I myself started graduate school at 14.

Well, I lost a year while my family
was tunneling out of North Korea.

Advantage, Kim.

I thought maybe you
could show Dennis around.

Let him see why we're the best
physics research facility in the country.

I know you're not.

You don't have an Open Science Grid
computer or a free electron laser.

The string theory research
being done is a dead end.

Excuse me, that is my research,
and it is by no means a dead end.

Well, obviously, you don't see it yet,
but trust me, you will.

Dennis, we've discussed this.

We're in the process
of updating our equipment.

We welcome your input
on our research goals.

We agree to look the other way
if you use 20 percent...

of the money you attract to smuggle
your grandfather out of Pyongyang.

We want him here, boys.

 Make it happen.
 Yes, sir.

You can count on us. We're on it.

What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?

I mean, the whole landscape
of false vacuums in string theory...

could be as large
as 10 to the 500th power.

In addition...

Ooh, look, chocolate milk.

I sense a disturbance in the force.

A bad feeling I have about this. Mm.

So how long have you been in America?

 A year and a half.
 No kidding.

 You speak English really well.
 So do you.

Except for your tendency
to end sentences with prepositions.

What are you talking about?

That.

He's not wrong.

All right, and this is my office.

 Is this part of the tour?
 Nope. Goodbye.

Sheldon,
we've hardly shown him anything.

All right, this is my desk.
These are my books.

This is my door.
Please close it behind you, goodbye.

You're doing work
in quantum loop corrections.

 Keen observation, goodbye.
 You see where you went wrong, don't you?

 Leonard.
 Ha.

 Yeah?
 Get him out.

Come, I'll show you the rec center.
They've got Nautilus equipment.

Do I look like I lift weights?

Not heavy ones.

It's startling you haven't considered
a Lorentz invariant or field theory approach.

You think I haven't considered it?

 You really think I haven't considered it?
 Have you considered it?

 Get him out, Leonard.
 Come on, Dennis.

I'll show you the radiation lab.

Wow. You won the Stevenson Award?

Yes. In fact,
I am the youngest person ever to win it.

Really? How old?

Fourteen and a half.

Mm. You were the youngest
ever to win it.

It's like looking
into an obnoxious mirror, isn't it?

Mm. This is really delicious, isn't it?

Still can't talk to me
unless you're drunk, huh?

Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.

Hey, I'm damaged too.

How about a hug for Howie?

Sure. Raj, hug Howard.


Something you'd like to share?

A tale of woe perhaps?

Fifteen years old.

Dennis Kim is 15 years old
and he's already correcting my work.

Today, I went from being
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to...

You know, that other guy.

Antonio Salieri?

Oh, God,
now even you're smarter than me.

You know, you don't have so many friends
that you can afford to start insulting them.

Just eat, Sheldon. You'll feel better.

Why waste food?

When a cow goes dry,
they don't keep feeding it...

they just take her out
and shoot her between the eyes.

I'm confused.
Did Sheldon stop giving milk?

You can't let this kid get to you.

You knew that someday, someone would
come along who's younger and smarter.

Yes, but I assumed
I would've been dead hundreds of years.

And that there'd be an asterisk by his name
because he'd be a cyborg.

So you got a little competition.
I really don't see what the big deal is.

Of course you don't.
You've never excelled at anything.

I don't understand, exactly how did
he get any friends in the first place?

We liked Leonard.

What are you gonna do, just give up?

Yes, it's what a rational person does
when his entire life's work is invalidated...

by a postpubescent Asian wunderkind.

He ceases his fruitless efforts,
he donates his body to scientific research...

and he waits to die.

I'm confused again. Is he waiting, or do
we get to shoot him between the eyes?

 Hey.
 Hey.

I've decided you're right.

 My career is not over.
 Great.

But since Dennis Kim
has rendered my research pointless...

I just have to find
something else to focus on.

Great.

So I've decided
I'm going to collaborate with you.

Great.

So, what exactly is it you do?

I know you chatter on about it all the time,
but I've never really paid attention.

Right now, I'm designing an experiment
to study the soft component...

of cosmic radiation at sea level,
but I don't need help.

Oh, sure you do.

Now see, what's this here in the schematic,
a laser array?

 Yes.
 Now, hmm...

What happens if you use argon lasers
instead of helium-neon?

 It would blow up.
 Are you sure?

 Pretty sure.
 "Pretty sure" is not very scientific.

Is this how you normally work?
Just hunches and guesses and stuff?

Okay.

I understand that you're going
through a bit of a career crisis.

You're searching for some other area
where you can feel valuable and productive.

But I need to tell you something,
and listen carefully.

 All right.
 Go away.

If you're concerned about sharing credit
with me, your name can go first... I'm going.

It's a small brown paper bag, Ma.

I'm looking at it right now.

Why would I make that up?
There's no Ding Dong in it.

How are two Ding Dongs tomorrow
gonna help me today?

So this is Engineering, huh?

I'll talk to you later.

Engineering,
where the noble semiskilled laborers...

execute the vision
of those who think and dream.

Hello, Oompa Loompas of science.

Sheldon, what are you doing here?

I just came by to say hello.

For three years,
you've never come by to say hello.

Well, up until now,
I've had better things to do.

So, what are we making today?

A small payload support structure for
a European science experimental package...

 ...that's going up on the next space shuttle.
 Really? How does it work?

It will be attached to the payload bay...

and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.

Aha.

So it's a shelf.

No, you don't understand.

During acceleration, it needs
to stay perfectly level and provide...

Yeah, okay, it's a shelf.

I notice you're using titanium.

Did you give any consideration
to carbon nanotubes?

They're lighter, cheaper
and have twice the tensile strength.

Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office
that says I have a master's in engineering.

And you also have a note from your mother
that says, "I love you, Bubula."

But neither of those is a cogent argument
for titanium over nanotubes.

 Sheldon.
 Yes?

Go away.

Did Leonard tell you to say that?

No, I thought of it all by myself.

Huh? Can't be a coincidence.

There must be some causal link
I'm missing.

Go away.

Curiouser and curiouser.

 Is he here?
 If he were, I wouldn't be.

You know what he did?
He watched me work...

and then started to design a simple piece
of software that could replace me.

Is that even possible?

As it turns out, yes.

 Something's gotta be done about him.
 Like what?

He'll never cope with the fact
that some 15-year-old is smarter...

and more accomplished than he is.

What if something were to happen to him
so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?

Then our problem would be solved.

Hang on, are we talking about
murdering Dennis Kim?

I'm not saying no.

We don't have to go that far.
There are other means.

We can't send him back to North Korea.

He knows how to get out.

The only thing we need to do
is make this Kim kid lose his focus.

It won't happen. He is not interested
in anything but physics.

 What about biology?
 What?

You know, biology.

The one thing that can completely derail
a world-class mind.

 Howard, he's 15.
 Yeah, so?

When I was 15, I met Denise Palmeri...

and my grade point average
fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.

She was sleeping with you?

No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking
about what it would be like if she did.

Oh, good, you're all here.

I've decided that if the three of you drop
whatever you're working on and join me...

we could lick cold fusion
in less than a decade, 12 years tops.

Go away?

Hmm.

Could it be me?

Hey, guys, what's up?

We need a hot 15-year-old Asian girl
with a thing for smart guys.

 What?
 Howard, that's racist.

Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick.

It's possible
she may have misunderstood us.


 Dr. Cooper. Oh, are we interrupting?
 No, no, please come in.

I think you'll appreciate this.
This is very exciting.

 What are you working on?
 Something remarkable.

Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize
in Physics have disappeared... Thank you.

I've decided to refocus my efforts
and use my people skills...

to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

Look, I'm going
to solve the Middle East crisis...

by building an exact replica of Jerusalem
in the middle of the Mexican desert.

To what end?

You know, it's like the baseball movie.
"Build it and they will come."

Who will come?

The Jewish people.

What if they don't come?

We'll make it nice, put out a spread.

Okay, well, speaking of spreads...

we're having a welcoming party
this afternoon for Mr. Kim...

 ...who's agreed to join us at the university.
 Of course he has.

The oracle told us little Neo was the one.

You can see the matrix, can't you?

Okay, well, obviously, you're very busy
with your, ah, um...

Come, Dennis.

You'll have to excuse Dr. Cooper.
He's been under a lot of, um...

He's nuts.



They'll come, they'll settle
And I'll win the prize

I don't understand your objections,
Professor Goldfarb.

Why wouldn't the Sonora Desert
make a perfectly good Promised Land?

Go away.

We could call it Nuevo Jerusalem.

Please go away.

Said Pharaoh to Moses.

Why are all these young women here?

It's Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

Really? I was not aware of that.

Oh, yes.
There was a very official e-mail...

that was sent to everyone
whose files indicated...

they had daughters
between the ages of 14 and 16.

Hmm.

 Smooth.
 Thank you.

There's the man of the hour.

So we have a socially awkward genius in
a room of attractive age-appropriate women.

All he has to do is hook up with one.

Anyone else see the flaw in this plan?

We need a social catalyst.

Like what?
We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.

 Or can we?
 No, we can't.

I don't think you mean we can't.
I think you mean we shouldn't.

Hey, Howard, you're a Jew.

If there was another Wailing Wall
exactly like the one in Jerusalem...

but close to taco stands
and cheap prescription drugs...

would you still wail at it?

Okay, it's definitely me.

We cannot leave this to chance.
Let's pick a girl...

and figure out
how to get her with Dennis.

How about that one?

Uh-uh. I know the type. Cheerleader,
student council, goes out with jocks.

Won't look at anybody
in the gifted program.

If she does agree to go out,
it turns out to be a setup.

You're in your mom's car with your pants off
while the whole football team laughs.

 Are you crying?
 No, I have allergies.

Okay. Uh...

Oh, hey, how about her?

Sure, if he wants to spend years
doing her homework...

while she drinks herself into a stupor
with nonfat White Russians.

And you're holding her head
while she's puking...

and wishes more guys were like you.

She gets into Cornell,
because you wrote her essay.

And you drive up to visit her one weekend
and she acts like she doesn't know you.

Okay, so not her either.

How about her?

Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby,
so probably low self-esteem.

I think that's our girl.

One of us should go talk to her.

I can't talk to her, you do it.

I can't just go up and talk to her.

Howard, you talk to her.

I don't know, she'll never go for the kid
once she gets a peek at this.

In India, this would be simpler.

Five minutes with her dad, 20 goats
and a laptop, and we'd be done.

Well, we're not in India.

Why don't we do it your way, then?

We'll arrange for her to move in across the
hall so he can pathetically moon over her.

 Okay, that was uncalled for.
 You started it, dude.


Could I have everyone's attention,
please?

What a wonderful occasion this is.

And how fortunate that it should
fall on Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

We're here to welcome Mr. Dennis Kim
to our little family.

Welcome, Dennis Kim.

Mr. Kim was not only the valedictorian
at Stanford University...

he is also the youngest recipient
of the prestigious Stevenson Award.

Youngest till the cyborgs rise up.

And now, without any further ado...

let me introduce the man of the hour,
Mr. Dennis Kim.

Dennis? Dennis.

What?

Would you like to tell us
about your upcoming research?

Oh, no, thanks.
I'm going to the mall with Emma.

The kid got a girl.

Unbelievable.

Did anyone see how he did it?

Don't worry, I've got this.

Ladies and gentlemen,
honored daughters...

while Mr. Kim,
by virtue of his youth and naiveté...

has fallen prey to the inexplicable need
for human contact...

let me step in and assure you
that my research will go on uninterrupted.

And that social relationships
will continue to baffle and repulse me.

Thank you.


 He's back.
 Yeah, mission accomplished.

Forget the mission. How did that
little yutz get a girl on his own?

I guess times have changed
since we were young.

Smart is the new sexy.

Then why do we go home alone
every night? We're still smart.

Maybe we're too smart.

So smart, it's off-putting.

Yeah, let's go with that.

Unbelievable.

Components I built
are on the space station...

and I get a ticket
for launching a rocket in the park.

I don't know if the ticket was so much for
the launch as for telling the policewoman:

"You have to frisk me.
I have another rocket in my pants."

Hey, look at that.

It's Dennis Kim.

Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.

I kind of feel bad
about what we did to him.

Yeah, we really ruined his life.

Screw him, he was weak.



Ma, Ma, calm down.

Listen to me.

I know it says click
with the mouse,

but on a laptop,
the trackpad is the mouse.

Now, put your finger on it.

Doesn't matter which finger.

Good choice.

Now move it down
to your e-mail icon.

Yeah, the little envelope.

What do you mean,
"What does it look like?"

It looks like an envelope!

Fine, you don't like
the computer,

don't use it!

Sure, we can exchange it
for a salad spinner. Good-bye!

That's a Hanukkah present
you're regretting, huh?

I won't say that
all senior citizens

who can't master technology
should be publicly flogged,

but if we made an
example of one or two,

it might give the others
incentive to try harder.

I had a great idea.

You know how
we're always having

to stop and solve
differential equations,

like when you're doing
Fourier analysis,

or using the
Schrodinger equation?

Howard doesn't.
He's only an engineer.

I was thinking,
we could write a little app

that would use
handwriting recognition,

and then run it through a
symbolic evaluation engine.

You just use your smartphone,

take a picture
of the equation and bam!

You know what's a great app?
The one that makes fart noises.

You know, Leonard,

that's actually
a valid idea.

Very good.

Can you say that and not
make it sound like I'm a cat

who learned
how to use the toilet?

No.

The two achievements
are equally surprising

and equally admirable,

though if pressed,

I'd have to give
a slight edge to the cat.

I'll save you the pain
and nervousness

of waiting for the answer.

I agree to be part of
your project. Congratulations.

Oh, yay for me.

What about you guys?

I can't promise anything,

but people do make money
off stuff like this.

A few extra bucks
would be nice.

I could finally move out
of my mother's house.

Where would you go?

I always dreamed about building
a little place of my own

over the garage.

You know, if I made more money,
I could take time off from work

and give pretty girls
submarine rides.

What's that?

Some weird sex thing?

No.

You take pretty girls underwater

in your private submarine,
and you show them fish.

Why does everything
have to be dirty with you?

I was thinking we could work
on this at night,

and then maybe
in a couple of weeks,

we'll have ourselves an app
to sell.

Sounds like
we're in business.

I think we should take a picture
to capture this moment.

Yeah.
Oh!

Was that the best 99 cents
I ever spent, or what?

 


I checked the
App Store.

No one is doing

handwriting-recognition
differential equation solving.

Oh, dear Lord, shush.

What?

You have so few good ideas,
Leonard.

And you're just going
to spill the beans

in front of an outsider?

Who, me?

Sheldon, I don't think
Penny cares

about handwriting-recognition
based differential...

 The stars at night
are big and bright 

 Deep in the heart
of Texas... 

She's not going
to steal our idea.

What idea?
We're gonna write an application...

 The prairie sky
is wide and high 

 Deep in the heart... 

Okay, stop, stop!

 Of Texas. 

Whatever your secret is,

I'm sure it's boring,
so I'm not interested.

It's not boring at all.

You see,
in higher order mathematics,

there are certain sets

of equations that...
Bored.

Satisfied?

Hardly.

Consider this unlikely
but very plausible scenario.

A young woman alone
in the big city.

Her ridiculous dream

of becoming an actress
lies shattered about her.

Hey, wait a minute.

Well, hang on. Let's
see where he's going.

Then it hits her.

How is she going to survive?

I mean, she has no prospects,
no marketable skills.

And then one day,

she meets a group of geniuses

and their friend Howard.

Hey, I...

Hang on.
Let's see where he's going.

She befriends them,
and then lies in wait

until they reveal
a marketable idea,

which she steals
and sells to the highest bidder.

 That is ridiculous.
 Oh, is it?

Let's see you come up
with an explanation

as to why this woman hangs out
with us all the time.

Oh, great. You know what?

I've already mooched
dinner off you guys.

I don't need to listen to this.

There's your answer--
free food.

All right,
I've taken the liberty

of drafting
these workflow charts

which outline our various duties
and the path we will follow

as we develop
our ground-breaking new app.

Hey, why am I in charge
of phone support?

Seems a bit racist.

A customer service
representative

with an Indian accent
will create the impression

we're a vast enterprise that
uses overseas call centers.

Oh.

Very clever.

But still racist.

Duly noted, Steve
from Wichita.

Why am I listed as your
executive assistant?

Because the word "secretary"
has fallen into disrepute.

FYI, my mother's
birthday is coming up.

I'm going to need you
to pick up a present.

Okay, we need
to stop for a minute.

Leonard, please,
we can talk during our break.

We have one coming up
at midnight.

We'll need snacks.

Sheldon, you're not in charge.

It's my idea.
I'm in charge.

Oh, of course you are.

Look at the organizational
chart.

You're clearly listed
as founder.

Well, yes, and you're listed

as Chief Executive Officer,

Chief Financial Officer
and Chief Operating Officer.

You missed
Chief Science Officer,

Chairman of the Board, and Head
of the Secret Santa Committee.

Okay.

You need to get clear
on this right now.

I am in charge of this project.

Ooh. Leonard's going all
alpha nerd on Sheldon's ass...

All right. All right,
I'm not going to argue with you.

Sheldon Cooper is nothing
if not a team player.

Dr. Hofstadter,
you have the conn.

Thank you.

I thought we might start

by talking
about the user interface.

Oh, dear Lord, we're doomed.

So this button here

will allow you
to scan a new equation,

but over here,
you can press this,

and just substitute new values
for the coefficients.

Good one, boss.

What?

This diagram.

I assume
you were opening with a joke.

It certainly buoyed up
this employee's esprit de corps.

It's not a joke.
It's the real design.

In that case, may I offer
27 little tweaks

to make it
slightly less embarrassing?

Sheldon, I think
this will work.

Let's just try it my way.

Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

I assumed that you wanted

candid truth-telling
from your employees,

but I realize now,
you want the mindless nattering

of complacent
yes-men.

Are you done?

If you say so, boss.

So right now,
this button-press event

is just triggering
a dummy procedure call...

How about this
for the app name?

The Surprisingly
Helpful Equation-Linked

Differential
Optimized Numerator.

So it spells "Sheldon."

Does it?

A happy accident.

We're not doing
names now. Howard?

Like I was saying, right now
it's just a dummy procedure,

but eventually,
it will drop us into...

All right, fine.

If we're not going
to give it a name,

can we at least give it
a secret code designation?

 No.
 Hear me out.

The atomic bomb
was The Manhattan Project.

Windows 95 was originally
Project Chicago.

For our app, I would humbly
suggest Project Nodlehs.

That's just
"Sheldon" backwards.

Another happy accident.

We're not wasting time
with names right now.

I see.

Is that decision open
for discussion?

No.

Is the decision to not
discuss it open for discussion?

No.

Again,

right now it's just
a dummy procedure,

but eventually,
it will drop us into...

I call for a vote
of no confidence

and an immediate change
in leadership.

Sheldon, stop it.

When in the course of human
events, it becomes necessary

to dissolve the bonds

that tie three competent
scientists together...

That's enough, Sheldon.
All right, let's get right to the vote.

Show of hands--
all those opposed

to Leonard
and his reign of tyranny.

Okay, that's it, you're fired.

Really?

Why?

Because you're impossible
to work with.

I see.

And is that open
for discussion?

What are you doing?

Oh. Good morning, shoemaker.

I think you'll be pleased

with what the elves were up to
last night.

I fired you.

Oh, I know. I'm now
an independent contractor.

No, you are
now nothing.

You have no connection
to this project whatsoever.

But I made it better.

I don't want it better.
I want it my way.

Well, that speaks volumes,
doesn't it?

All right, I suppose
I'll go put on my bus pants.

What the hell are bus pants?

They are pants one wears
over one's regular pants

when one sits on bus seats

that other people
have previously sat on.

But perhaps
from your lofty heights

atop the corporate ladder,
you've lost touch

with the struggles
of the common man.

Look, I'm still happy
to drive you to work.

Nothing's changed
in that regard.

We're still roommates,
we're still friends.

Except you identified me,
your best friend,

as a gangrenous limb
that needed to be severed

from the organism
and tossed away.

The desperate act
of a little man

with a big Napoleon complex.

You know what?

Go put on your bus pants.

Mm. Last night,
I had a dream

we got so rich from the app,

you and I bought matching
side-by-side mansions.

But...

there was a secret tunnel

connecting your front yard
to my back yard.

What do you think that means?

It means after we play handball,
I'm showering at home.

Good morning, Friend Howard.

Friend Raj.

I see you gentlemen
are enjoying beverages.

Perhaps they would taste better
out of these.

"World's Greatest
Astrophysicist"?

Don't thank me. You earned it.

"Howard Wolowitz."

Why not
"World's Greatest Engineer"?

I'm sorry.

I typed that
into the label maker,

but I just couldn't press enter.

Now down to business.

What would it take for you
to abandon Leonard

and join me in a rival company?

Unless, of course,
the mugs are sufficient,

in which case, welcome aboard.

We're not quitting on Leonard.

I understand.
Your loyalty is admirable.

But what if I were
to up the ante?

What are you talking about?

Monogrammed key chains

with a built-in laser pointer.

No?

How about can cozies

emblazoned
with our university mascot?

Go, Beavers.

I'll be back.

Okay, let's try this one.

"Spherical Hankel function."

Hold on.

That's it!

Eureka!

Hey, we agreed when
it was "Eureka" time,

we were all gonna
say it together.

Fine.

Let's say it together.

No. The moment
has passed.

Greetings, gentlemen.

How goes your
little project?

You mean,
"Project Lenwoloppali"?

Ah, a combination
of all your names.

Very clever.

I assume "Koothranardowitz"
was taken?

We're actually
scanning equations

and getting good results.

Oh, well then,
by all means, carry on.

I wouldn't want
to impede your progress.

Howard, did you solve
the install time problem yet?

No. It's a little tricky.

I'm gonna try having it pick up
the libraries dyn...

What are you doing?!

Playing the theremin.

No. I mean, what are you
doing with a theremin?

Playing it.

I've loved the theremin
from the first moment

I heard the original
Star Trek theme.

And it's been killing me

that it just sits in my closet,
gathering dust.

Sheldon!
We're working here!

That's all right.

I can barely hear you
over my theremin.

Well, that was a
little uncalled for.

No, that was
completely called for.

We need quiet.

So, your project is more
important than mine?

Well, seeing as your project
is to sabotage my project, yes.

Don't beat around the bush,
Leonard.

If you don't want me here,

just say the word,
and I'll leave.

Could have beaten
around the bush a little.

 Nobody knows 

 The trouble I've seen 

 Nobody knows my sorrow 

 Oh, oh, oh. 

What you doing?

Trying to contact
your home planet?

I'm practicing my theremin.

Oh.

 Nobody knows 

 The trouble I've seen 

 Glory, hallelujah. 

Something got you down,
there, Sheldon?

Leonard kicked me out
of my own apartment.

And his app team.

Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

He wouldn't drive me
to work today.

I had to wear
my bus pants.

 Is that so?
 Yes.

And they're
still sticky.

Aw...

Probably going to have
to throw them away.

Hey, you don't need
Leonard and his app.

You can make one with me.

With you?

Seriously,
I have a great idea for one.

Is it better than your idea
to move to Los Angeles

and become a famous actress?

Okay, look...

when you see someone
wearing shoes you like,

you just snap a picture of them,

and the app goes on the Internet

to find out
where you can buy them.

That's your app idea?

Well, you don't like it?

I didn't say that.
But no, I don't.

Why not?

Oh, Penny,
where do I begin?

The simple-mindedness
of your idea

is exceeded only by its
crass consumerism and banality.

And Leonard didn't want
to work with you?

Imagine that.

I know, it's baffling.

 Nobody knows 

 The trouble I've seen... 

Sheldon, I'm gonna
make some cocoa.

Do you want some?

Do you make it
with milk or water?

 Milk.
 Real cocoa?

That's what it says
on the packet.

Do you have
those little marshmallows?

No, sorry.

Well, I suppose
it's appropriate.

What does that mean?

A disappointing drink
for a disappointing day.

Hey, look at this.

20 people from the university
have already signed up

for our private beta.

I'm telling you,

the Lenwoloppali
Differential Equation Scanner

meets a real need.
We've got a hit.

What do you think we
should sell it for?

Well, based on the fact
that our potential market

is about 70 or 80 guys,

and you want a submarine,

I'd say about a
million dollars a pop.

Well, what if we put out a lite
version for half a million?

You know,
get the word of mouth going.

Hi. I'm sorry
to bother you guys,

but you've got to come
take your Sheldon back.

What's he doing
in your apartment?

Well, he was moping down in the
lobby, so I invited him over.

Now I regret it.

Why do you regret...
Uh, never mind, stupid question.

Look, can't you just let him
play with you until bedtime?

We're not playing.

This is real work.

We're going to
be hundred-aires.

Okay. What if I got him
to apologize

and promise to behave?

Then I guess we would
let him back on the app team,

and while we're doing that,
you could take an aerial tour

of L.A. on your flying pig.

Okay. Wait right here.

I'll tell you one thing.
If I get rich enough,

that's the kind of girl I want
to take on a submarine ride.

And yes, that time,
I meant it to be dirty.

Really?

Leonard wants me back?

Oh, yes. He says they
are lost without you.

Well, we sure saw that coming.

That's right.

You know what
I'm going to do?

I am going to sit here
and just let them stew.

No, no, no. You know,

they have
suffered enough.

Everybody's
suffered enough.

The thing is, you're going
to have to offer him

a face-saving
way out of this.

How?

Say you're sorry.

Oh, no.

Mrs. Mary Cooper
didn't raise her no liars.

Okay. Um...

How about this? You know
how you're always trying

to learn about sarcasm?

No.
No?

I was being sarcastic.

Oh. Good for you.

So all you have to do here
is say you're sorry to Leonard,

but say it
sarcastically.

Of course.

He will hear it as an attempt
to mend fences,

as opposed
to the withering condemnation

you and I will know it to be.

Yeah. Yeah, that
was my plan.

All right.
Come on. Let's go.

Oh, by the way,
thank you

for the delicious cocoa.

Oh, you're welcome.

Boy, I'm getting
good at this.

Okay, now that you're
back on the team,

let's get you caught up.

Before you begin,
let me say again

how deeply sorry I am
for my earlier behavior

and how much I respect
and admire your leadership.

Thank you.

So as you can see,

not only can you store
your favorite equations,

but you can forward them
to your friends

or post them on Facebook
right from the app.

Well, I must say,
I am impressed.

Thanks.

You all have clearly put
in a lot of hard work.

We have.

As a result,
you have taken

the most important step
on the road to success:

learning what not to do.

Now, let's start fresh.

Howard, we're going
to need some tea.

Okay, these are Uggs.

These are Crocs.

These are knockoff
Manolo Blahniks.

Bored.

Look, you said it yourself,
we have to create a database

before you can write
an alga-thingy.

Algorithm.

You see, Penny, Alan Turing
defined an algorithm...

Bored.

Okay.

These are Steve Maddens.

These are Nine West.

These are Target. Oh, but don't
they look like Chanel?

These are
Michael Kors...

 Nobody knows... 



Boy, seems like forever since
the four of us have been out to eat.

You know, just the guys.

Oh, God. Yes, we get it.
You have a girlfriend now.

 A little jealous, are we?
 No, I'm not jealous.

All right, I'd kill a hobo if it would
get me laid. Now, can we order?

Oh, dear Lord, they redid the menu.

So what? It's the same food.

Oh, is it? Look at this.

General Tso's Chicken
is no longer listed under "specialties."

It's now under "chicken."

 So?
 Yes, General Tso.

Not "Tso" the chicken,
"so" the question.

 So?
 So why is it no longer a specialty?

Did the chef lose confidence
in the dish or himself?

And look over here.
"Shrimp in mobster sauce."

What is mobster sauce?

 It's obviously a typo.
 Perhaps.

Or perhaps this restaurant's now
a front for organized crime.

For all we know, the mobster sauce...

contains actual chunks
of deceased mobsters.

No, no, no. I think it just means
it's the kind of sauce that mobsters like.

It doesn't mean any of that.
It's a typo.

 You know what? Let's just get a pizza.
 Good idea. We'll go to Corleone's.

Sure, no mobsters there.

You know, the more I think about it...

the mobster sauce couldn't
possibly contain chunks of mobster.

 And why is that?
 It was listed under "seafood."

What if they were mobsters
who slept with the fishes?

Leonard, are we having
a serious conversation or not?

What the...?

 The TV is gone.
 So are our laptops.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Oh, God!

It's all right.

They didn't take my comic books.

They took our TV, two laptops,
four external hard drives...

our PS2, our PS3, our Xbox,
our Xbox 360, our classic Nintendo...

our Super Nintendo,
our Nintendo 64, and our Wii.

We like games.

Right, games. They took "Halo 1," "Halo 2,"
"Halo 3," "Call of Duty 1," "Call of Duty 2"...

"Call of Duty 3," "Rock Band"...

"Final Fantasy I" through "IX,"
"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"...

"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,"
"Super Mario Bros."

"Mario & Sonic
at the Winter Olympics"...

and "Ms. Pac-Man."

Assorted video games.

When does the CSI team get here?

 What?
 In anticipation of their arrival...

I've bagged some evidence.

One of the thieves had the audacity
to quench his thirst...

while ransacking our home.
You should be able to pull prints off this.

Here are my prints
so you can rule me out as a suspect.

 What about me?
 I'm sorry, Leonard...

it's too early to discount the possibility
of this being an inside job.

Would I be completely out of line
to ask you to shoot him?

I'd be happy to put him under
a 72-hour psychiatric hold.

I'm not crazy.
My mother had me tested.

We're done. Call this number,
and we'll fax you a copy of the report.

You can submit it
to your insurance company.

I'm sorry, that's the end
of your inquiry?

Do you have any more information
that might be relevant?

Goodness. Where do I begin?
For instance, my laptop...

contained four out of the five
gedanken experiments necessary...

for a restatement of
the quantum measurement problem.

How's that going to help them?

They could monitor
scientific publications...

and see if anyone posts such
a restatement in the next couple of months.

If so, the authors are most likely
in possession of my stolen laptop.

Good night, fellas.

Come on, Bochco.

What are we supposed to do now?

The only thing we can do:

Watch TV on our phones
until the criminals return...

and bludgeon us to death
in our sleep.

Does that mean you've ruled me out
as a suspect?

Oh, how I wish I could.

I do not have to urinate.

I am the master of my own bladder.

Drat.

I can't believe it. If I hadn't
been working the dinner shift...

I would've run right into
the robbers.

Hey, there's no reason for you
to be scared.

I'm not scared. I would've gone
all Nebraska on their asses.

Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.

 Leonard and Penny.
 Hand me the bat.

We just had a major crime
in the building...

and you open the door
without asking who it is?

It won't happen again. What's up?

Nothing. Just wanted to see
if you were both okay.

We're fine, Sheldon.

All right, then.

 Good night.
 Good night.

 Well, that was weird. Even for him.
 Mm.

Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.

Who is it?

Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.

 Yes?
 May I come in?

Yeah.

I see you're drinking wine.

Yes, we are. And we're about
to go to bed.

Uh-huh.

Sheldon, do you wanna
sleep here tonight?

As small as Leonard is...

I don't think the two of you
would be comfortable on the couch.

 So, what do you want?
 It's not what I want.

It's what evolution wants.
Human beings are primates.

Primates have evolved to live in groups
both for protection and support.

But you don't like other people.

I do tonight.

It's scary over there.

It's getting scary here too.

Um...

"Three Little Kittens"?

"Three Little Pigs"?

God, I don't know.

Star Wars?

Did we win? Can we go to bed?

Good Lord, I could not have
made this easier.

A hydrogen atom, H,
plus pigs minus P, "higs."

Bow, General Zod trapped
in the Phantom Zone...

"bow-zone."

Pear, tickle, "pear-tickle."

"Higgs boson particle."
How could you not get that?

He's right, Penny. It's all there.

Look, Sheldon, sweetie,
I know you're feeling insecure...

 ...but we've really gotta go to sleep.
 All right.

I'll take the first watch
and wake you at 0400.

 Great. Good night.
 Wait, wait. What's 0400?

 Four a.m.
 That's, like, in 45 minutes.

Just keep walking.

 It's quiet out there.
 Maybe a little too quiet.

 Where are you going?
 Just gonna take a look around outside.

Bad idea.

No, Jim, don't open the door.

Listen to her, Jim.

Don't worry. There's no one out there.

Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.

Who is it?

All right. We've got a titanium deadbolt
and a reinforced jam controlled by...

a state-of-the-art
electronic access system.

 What if they cut the power?
 There's a 200-watt...

 ...uninterruptible backup power supply.
 If someone steals my keys?

There are independent voice
and fingerprint scanners.

What if somebody kidnaps me,
records my voice...

and then cuts off my thumb?

I'll send them a basket of muffins.

Now, inside we've got motion detectors,
infrared sensors...

and cameras connected to a server...

running state-of-the-art
facial-recognition software.

Where did you get all this stuff?

I got a buddy over at
the Department of Defense.

 He just gave it to you?
 I'm sure he would've if I'd asked.

Ironically, their security isn't
all that good.

Raj, your car is blocking me.

Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

 Intruder alert.
 What the hell?

 Sorry, let me help you.
 Intruder alert.

Wonderful security system if
we're attacked by a school of tuna.

Don't worry,
the net's gonna be electrified.

Picture her on the floor,
spasming uncontrollably.

Better.

Sheldon's journal.

Security system In place.
However, sleep continues to elude me.

I've seen the underbelly of Pasadena...

this so-called City of Roses...

and It haunts me. Ah! The Injustice.

I lie here awake, tormented,
while out there, evil lurks...

probably playing "Donkey Kong"
on my classic Nintendo.

Oh, dear.

I am the master of my own bladder.

Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.

Oh, my...

God, Sheldon.

What the hell are you doing
out there?

I heard a noise.

It was us.
We knocked over a lamp.

 Why would you knock over a lamp?
 We were gonna...

He doesn't need to know
what we were doing, Leonard.

Oh.

No, she's right. I don't need to know
what you were doing.

 Carry on.
 What are you doing? Use the door.

Good thinking.

Hey, perhaps I'll check the perimeter
and make some warm milk.

Great. You do that.

Would you like me to bring you
some warm milk?

I'm lactose intolerant.

And you don't wish to alarm me with
any more loud noises. Very thoughtful.

 Warm milk, Penny?
 No, thanks.

Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.

 Sorry about that.
 What can you do?

Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
Intruder alert.

Looks like Wolowitz
got the net electrified.

 Sheldon, are you okay?
 I'm fine.

Though I'm no longer
the master of my own bladder.

My new computer came with
Windows 7.

Windows 7 is much more user-friendly
than Windows Vista.

I don't like that.

Don't you think looking for a new city
to live in is a bit of an overreaction?

Our apartment was broken into.

Our security system tried to kill me.

And as a result, I'm leaving Pasadena
forever. Tell me how that's overreacting.

Come on, Sheldon. You can't move.
Don't you need to stay in one place...

so the mother ship can find you
when it returns?

Oh, if that were only true.

Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound
for the foreseeable future...

I need to find a location
that's more hospitable...

than the mean streets of Pasadena.
Like Enid, Oklahoma.

Low crime rate,
and high-speed Internet connectivity...

but no model-train shops.

Sorry, Enid.

Is he quitting his job
at the university?

Oh, no. He's gonna telecommute.

Everybody's really excited about it.

All right. Boone, North Carolina.

"Every summer since 1952,
Boone has hosted...

an outdoor amphitheater portrayal
of the life and times...

of its namesake: Danel Boone."

That sounds like something
that would attract the wrong crowd.

 Penny, you're from Nebraska, correct?
 Born and raised.

It will take me a few days to get settled.
After I do, I will e-mail you...

detailed PDFs containing diagrams
and instructions...

that will guide you through packing
and shipping my possessions...

to Bozeman, Montana.

In the meantime,
please forward my mail.

Anyplace specific, or just
the Bozeman, Montana loony bin?

I sense you're making a joke,
but Bozeman does have...

a comedy club called the Loony Bin,
so do not forward my mail there.

Oh, come on. So you were the victim
of a crime. That's part of life.

When my great-grandfather
first came to this country...

he put all his hopes and dreams
into this little butcher shop...

he ran on the Lower East Side
of New York. You know what happened?

Every customer who
walked into that butcher shop...

and asked for a pound of liver...

got ripped off.

But those people moved on,
and so should you.

I am moving on.
I'm going to be a Bozite.

They call themselves Bozites?

They should. It's one of the first things
I plan to bring up upon arrival.

Sheldon, I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm gonna miss you.

Please, Penny. As you know, I'm not
comfortable with prolonged goodbyes...

and maudlin displays of emotion,
so I've prepared a short video.

Greetings. As you know, I'm not
comfortable with prolonged goodbyes...

and maudlin displays of emotion,
so I've prepared this short video.

The four of you are three of my closest
friends and one treasured acquaintance.

Though I cannot state categorically
that my life will be diminished...

by not having you in it, I am
comfortable If you choose to believe that.

Since you intend to remain
In this lawless metropolitan area...

statistics suggest that you will
succumb to tragic and gruesome ends...

before we meet again.
Live long and prosper.

Sheldon, that's so...

You might wanna lock the door
behind me. This isn't Bozeman.

How the hell do I know who's the friend
and who's the acquaintance?

That is a bracing cold.
An invigorating cold.

Lord, is it cold.

Help you with your bag, sir?

Thank you, fellow Bozite.

And may I say,
you are the living embodiment...

of all the promises made by
our lovely town's chamber of commerce.

Wait.

Excuse me!

One ticket to
Pasadena, California, please.

Hey, look who's back.

Interesting. The acquaintance is
the first to greet me.



Okay, it's done.
Look, guys,

for the future, I don't mind
killing the big spiders,

but you have to at least try
with the little ones.

Please. We're facing a far more
serious problem than stray arachnids.

It's not so bad.

Not bad? It's horrible.

You hear stories about this things,
but you never think it'll happen to you.

So they steamed your dumplings.
Get over it.

 New topic, please.
 All right, Penny.

Let me take this
opportunity to point out

that you are looking
particularly ravishing today.

Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.

So, there is a number.

Okay, new topic, please.

Did you hear the people
upstairs in 5A are moving out?

What?!

 The people upstairs are moving out.
 No!

The horror...

Why would you just say
something like that?

 How else was I supposed to say it?
 Slowly.

Like putting a new fish in a tank.
You don't just drop it in.

You let the bag sit
in the water a while.

The horror...

 I'm sure it's going to be fine.
 No, it's not going to be fine.

Change is never fine.
They say it is, but it's not.

Honey, did you even know
the people that are moving out?

I never met them.

That's what made them perfect.

There were no awkward
"hellos" in the halls.

There's no clickety-clacking
of high heel shoes on hardwood floors.

They may as well have
been a family of cats

just jumping around
from drape to drape.

Without that annoying
ammonia urine smell.

I'm sure the new people
will be just as quiet.

You can't know that.
How can you possibly know that?

You're right, I can't. You know what?
Anyone could rent that apartment now:

an opera singer,
the cast of Stomp...

Yeah, a tap-dancing pirate
with a wooden leg.

Why are you making it worse?

I tried making it better.
He wouldn't go for it.

You're right!
That's a great idea.

 What?
 I'll take the apartment upstairs.

I can finally get
away from my mother

and we can all spend
some more time together.

If you catch my drift.

The horror...

Subtitles: The FWT Team

Hold on. You honestly expect me
to believe that social protocol

dictates we break our backs
helping Wolowitz move,

and then he only
need buy us a pizza?

I'm sorry, that really is
how it works.

You're tricking me.

You tell me the truth,
what do we get?

Help me out here.

You get to choose between
a mountain bike or a PS3.

I knew it!

PS3, definitely PS3.

Who would pick a mountain bike?

Enough with the guilt, Ma.

We'll still see each other.

I'll come over every night
and have dinner with you.

The hell you will!

What am I running here,
a fancy restaurant?

Does this look like Olive Garden?!

Okay, I get it, you're angry.

You don't want to see
your little bird leave the nest.

"Little bird"?

You're almost 30!

Fly, for God's sake!

Fine, I'll stay!

Ya happy, crazy lady?
I sure as hell hope so,

because you're ruining my life!

Hey, Penny? Good news,
you can take your head out of the oven.

I guess I won't be needing this.

The new ones.

They're here.

Stay calm. We don't know
anything about them yet.

 What are you doing?
 I'm checking for musical instruments.

Does that sound
like castanets to you?

The box says "kitchen."

So? Do cocaine smugglers
write "cocaine" on the box?

Hello?

 Hello.
 Hello.

I'm Alicia.
I'm moving in upstairs.

That is so great.

Oh, I'm Leonard.
I live downstairs.

Upstairs from here, but under you.

Not under you per se, but...

under your apartment.

 That's nice.
 Yeah, it is.

If that concludes
your faltering attempt to mate...

On a scale
of one to ten, how light of foot

would you describe yourself,
with one being not cat-like at all,

and ten being freakishly feline?

"Freakishly feline"?

Is that your answer or do you
not understand the question?

We'll come back to that one.

Hang on. Are you now
or have you ever been

a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?

 You're making her uncomfortable.
 Oh, I'm sorry.

If it helps you feel any better,
you're doing very well so far.

Next question: are you fertile?

What?!

I'm trying to determine whether crying
infants above my head are a possibility.

 I have no immediate plans.
 If that changes, let me know.

And finally, area rugs, pro or con?

 Pro?
 Alicia?

 Yes?
 Welcome to the building.

Thanks so much for helping me.

Thank you so much for giving
me the opportunity to help.

Hey, guys.

This is Alicia, our new neighbor.

 Hi.
 Hi.

I'm helping.

I can see.

Alicia's non-musical,
childless and pro-rug.

She's still on probation, of course,
but I like her.

Cool T-shirt.

Oh, I don't usually dress like this.
I'm going jogging.

 You don't jog.
 I can start.

True, but the more likely explanation is
that you're out of clean clothes again.

 Thank you, Sheldon.
 You're welcome, Penny.

Please, you look cute.
I'm dressed like a slob today, too.

I think you look fantastic.

This one's a player, huh?

Yeah, be careful.

Thanks for the warning.

 I'll see you around.
 See ya.

I'm dressed like a slob today, too.

Oh, mimicry.

I enjoy mimicry.

I've been working on Admiral Ackbar
from Return of the Jedi.

"It's a trap."

You have to imagine me
with a giant squid head.

"It's a trap."

Come.

Congratulations,
I see you did your laundry.

 Sort of.
 How does one "sort of..."

I bought new clothes, okay?

 Is Leonard around?
 He's upstairs at Alicia's.

Oh. All right,
that's cool, no biggie.

He said he'd help me set up my printer,
but I guess I can wait.

What exactly is he doing up there?

In what I can only perceive
as a tactical move to destroy me,

he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali
setting up her stereo.

Oh, they're all up there?
Typical.

It's axiomatically atypical.

Up until recently,
they did not know her,

and had no encounters with her
in a previous location.

They never went upstairs
to visit the former tenants.

Your characterization of their behavior
as "typical" is demonstrably fallacious.

Now I see the giant squid head.

Oh, great!
Now, I have to start all over again.

Yeah, I thought about renting
this apartment,

but I'm really more of a
"downtown loft" kind of guy.

Cool. So are you in a loft now?

Oh, actually, I'm,
living with a woman in Altadena.

Purely platonic.
She's also my maid.

 Sounds like a sweet deal.
 I won't lie. It's pretty dope.

I just wanted to bring you
a little housewarming gift.

That is so sweet.

 Come on in. Let's open it.
 Great.

Nice dress.

This? I'm dressed like a slob today.

The guys have been helping me
set up my sound system.

I've never had
such good-looking technical support.

Pish-posh.

I don't know, it means shucks.

"Shucks" means shucks.
Let one go once in a while.

You want to hear something awesome?

Alicia is an actress, just like you.

That is so awesome.

Well, trying to be,
but it's so hard.

 I know, tell me about it.
 I've been out here 3 months,

and all I've gotten
is a couple of national commercials

and this recurring thing on a soap.

That's why I work
at the Cheesecake Factory.

I'm holding out for the right part.

What do you want as your default setting
for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?

Whatever you think is best, cutie.

Well, DTS has more low end, so...

Hey, guys, guys,
you will really appreciate this.

I read the best science joke.

You won't get it,
but it's right up their alley.

Anyway,

this physicist goes
into an ice cream parlor every week

and orders an ice cream sundae
for himself,

and then offers one
to the empty stool sitting next to him.

This goes on for a while until the owner
finally asks him what he's doing.

The man says,
"Well, I'm a physicist,

"and quantum mechanics... teaches us

"that it is possible
for the matter above this stool

"to spontaneously turn
into a beautiful woman

"who might accept my offer
and fall in love with me."

The owner then says, "Lots of single,
beautiful women come in here ever day.

"Buy an ice cream for one of them,
and they might fall in love with you."

And the physicist says,

"Yeah, but what are the odds
of that happening?"

It's a little insulting,
don't you think?

How would I know?
I'm not even sure I get it.

Leonard?

If you're done with the DVD player,
can you set up my printer?

Yeah, I'd love to.

Maybe when you're done with her printer,
you could set up mine.

You know, like you promised...
a week ago.

Yeah, I'll get to it. Don't nag me.

Hello there.

Who is it?

Hello, Penny.
It's open... Come in.

Sarcasm.

 Well, they're all still up there.
 You think I can't hear them?

Listen to that: stomp, stomp, stomp.

That's Wolowitz
in his stacked heels that fool no one.

I don't even know why I care.
I don't care.

Enough to memorize that stupid joke,
but that's all I care.

You know, Penny,

there's something
that occurs in beehives

you might find interesting.

Occasionally,

a new queen will arrive

while the old queen
is still in power.

When this happens,

the old queen must either locate
to a new hive

or engage in a battle to the death

until only one queen remains.

What are you saying,
that I'm threatened by Alicia?

I'm like the old queen of the hive
and it's just time for me to go?

I'm just talking about bees.

They're on The Discovery Channel.

What are you talking about?

Bees.

I just got that physicist joke.

Gee, Penny,
thanks for buying us dinner.

 Yeah, what's the occasion?
 No occasion.

Just felt like
getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.

Did you remember to ask for the chicken
to be diced, not shredded?

Even though the menu description
specifies shredded?

Brown rice, not white?

Did you stop at the grocery
for the good hot mustard?

And pick up the low-sodium soy sauce
from the market?

Good.

See how it's done?

What do we got going on tonight?

Playing Halo, watching Battlestar,
drop some Mentos in Diet Coke?

 You want to watch Battlestar?
 What can I say?

I got my geek on, boys.

No, PMS is different.

 Thank God you're home. I need help.
 What's wrong?

I got a callback to audition for CSI
to play a hooker who gets killed.

I'd watch that.

But my car is in the shop,

and I have to be
at Universal in 45 minutes.

I'll take you.

You're a lifesaver.

 I'll run lines with you in the car.
 Great.

And afterward,
I'll take you all out for Chinese.

Actually, we already have...

Starving.

 Chinese food right here.

They're gone, Penny.
They can't hear you.

I cannot believe they're letting her
just use them like that.

Anything she wants, they go
panting after her like trained dogs.

You know last week,
she had Howard drive all the way

to her uncle's house in Orange County
to pick up her TV?

You once had Leonard
and me get your television

from your ex-boyfriend.

Apples and oranges here, Sheldon.

I'm telling you, that girl is a user,
skating through life on her looks,

taking advantage of weak-willed men,

getting auditions
for stupid network shows.

It just creams my corn.

 May I interject something here?
 Please.

You got the wrong mustard.

Guess what?

I got the part on CSI.

Oh, boy.

Something wrong?

No, you know, congratulations.
I think you'll make a great hooker.

Thank you.

I got to ask you something.

How much do physicists make?

I don't know. I don't think a lot.

Yeah, that's what I figured.

Well, got to run.

The guys promised
to set up my satellite dish

and paint my bedroom.

Can I talk to you
about that for a second?

About what?

You know, it's just that Leonard
and Howard and Raj,

they aren't like other guys.

They're special.

Okay, they're special... and?

Let's see. How can I explain this?

They don't know
how to use their shields.

 Shields?
 Yeah, like in Star Trek,

when you're in battle
and you raise the shields?

Where the hell'd that come from?

Anyways, you know
how guys like this are, so...

please don't take advantage of them.

Who says
I'm taking advantage of them?

Come on.
They're doing everything for you,

because you're leading them on.

So I let them do stuff for me.

They're happy. I get stuff.

Who cares?

And how's it any different
from what you do?

Excuse me?

I've seen you around them.

Are you pretending
like you don't do the exact same thing?

Okay, lady,

you are way out of line.

I'm out of line?

Yeah, you're out of line.

What are you going to do about it,

bitch?

I like Green Lantern.

I'm just saying it's pretty lame
that he can be defeated

by the color yellow.

Only the modern Green Lantern
is vulnerable to yellow.

Golden age Green Lantern
was vulnerable to wood.

Great, so I can take them both out
with a number-two pencil?

Oh, my God! Girl fight!

 What are you doing?
 I know you.

You're stupid enough to break it up.

May I say you look
very comely tonight?

Thank you.

You're right,
this filly's been broken.

You set it on DTS, didn't you?

I had to.

She called me "cutie."

According to Alicia's Facebook page,

she's hooking up
with one of the producers on CSI.

Dead whore on TV,
live one in real life.

Great.

Now she's jumping
up and down on the bed.



Why do I always have
to carry the heavy stuff?

Well, it's very simple.

In our ragtag band of scientists
with nothing to lose...

I'm the smart one.
Wolowitz is the funny one.

Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner...

who struggles to understand our ways
and fails.

That leaves you, by default,
as the muscle.

One more floor
and I'd be the pulled muscle.

Oh, it's about time. I'm starving.

Uh, well,
we didn't actually get Chinese food.

 Why not?
 Don't panic. This is better.

Oh, no. You didn't trade the food
for magic beans, did you?

Of course not. And, technically,
magic beans would be food.

Eating them would be a waste,
since you could plant them...

and have a giant beanstalk which
would provide roughage for a small city.

Yeah, sometimes I don't listen.

Sometimes I just watch your jaw
go up and down.

We were on our way to the restaurant.

We saw Adam West, so we followed him.

 Who's Adam West?
 Who's Adam West?

What do the two of you
talk about after the coitus?

My guess is,
"Hey, four minutes. New record."

That's why I'm the funny one.

Anyway, we followed the guy
to this garage sale.

They had the coolest stuff.

They were closing up.
We got this whole box for 60 bucks.

We didn't go through it.
There could be anything.

There a new girlfriend in there?
You might need one.

No, but there is an original final draft
Ghostbusters script...

with actual slime stains.

Oh, you're right, it's Ghostbusters Il.
Never mind.

Oh, my God.

An ALF doll.

When I was 11, my mother got me one
to help me sleep after my dad left.

I used to pretend that my dad
had moved to the planet Melmac...

and ALF was gonna bring him back
to me.

But he never did.

Where's my daddy, puppet?

Where is he?

That is so sad.

No, what's sad is that you don't know
that Adam West was TV's Batman.

Here's Spock's head with no body.

Here's Mr. T's body with no head.

Oh, yeah, here's Spock's body
with Mr. T's head.

"I pity the fool who's illogical."

I'm just gonna go home
and make a grilled cheese...

and window-shop on eHarmony.

 Okay, bye.
 Okay.

Ooh, look,
an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.

And an Aquaman action figure.

Looks like someone drew a penis on him.

Eh. That'll come off.

You see what you're doing? Stop that.

 Fascinating.
 What?

 It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
 Oh.

It's even got the Elvish engraving on it.

It's not Elvish.

It's the language of Mordor
written in Elvish script.

"One ring to rule them all."

"One ring to find them."

"One ring to bring them all."

"And in the darkness, bind them."

Holy crap, are we nerdy.

So I was doing some checking
on the ring...

Hold on. Sheldon,
is there ketchup on that table?

Yes, there is. Oh, here's a fun fact.

Ketchup started out as a general term
for sauce...

typically made of mushrooms
or fish brine with herbs and spices.

Some popular early main ingredients
included blueberry, anchovy...

oyster, kidney bean and grape.

No, that's okay, I'll get it.

Listen, I was looking at the ring
and it seemed a little weird.

No copyright notice on it.

So I took it down to this buddy of mine
who deals with...

shall we say, the seedy underbelly
of the collectibles world.

Seedy underbelly?

Uh, your black-market phasers...

your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura
panties, that kind of stuff.

Who's this mysterious buddy
you suddenly have?

Just a guy. I know a guy.

 Is it Eddie Crispo?
 No, I can't tell you who it is.

 Who else could it be? It has to be.
 I know lots of dangerous people.

 Name one.
 Eddie Crispo.

Anyway, he said this isn't a replica.

It's the real deal.

If you're suggesting that
that is the actual ring of power...

forged by Sauron in Mount Doom...

I look at you with an expression
of exhaustion...

and ever-so-slight amusement.

He's not saying it's a magic ring.

You're not, are you?

No, but it's close.

Look at the markings inside.

Those are production markings.

Nine rings were made
for use in the movies.

Three were given to members
of the cast. The rest were destroyed.

Except one.

One was stolen.

Gentlemen, this is the One Ring.

Mine.

No, it is not yours.
We all went in on the box together.

Yes, but I found it in the box.

And the laws of maritime salvage
clearly state...

that the finder of a sunken treasure
is the owner.

How is this maritime salvage?

Other than the lack of water,
how is it not?

Wait, Sheldon.
Stop being crazy for a second.

How much is something like this worth?

Well, it's tough to say, since it's hot.

On the underground market,
my guy figures...

 Your guy Eddie Crispo?
 Yes.

 He figures 10-, maybe 15,000.
 Okay, that's a lot of money.

The wise thing to do
is invest it in something practical.

Like a Jet Ski.

Why do you want a Jet Ski?

All the wealthy and beautiful people
in movies ride Jet Skis.

 That can't just be a coincidence.
 Ugh.

We can't sell it. We have to keep it
and love it and polish it.

Take it out occasionally
when we go to the park...

and reenact our favorite scenes
from the movies.

It's sad how great that sounds.

Guys, it's stolen.
It should go back to Peter Jackson.

 He made the movies. It belongs to him.
 Fine.

He can have it back.

As long as he promises to make me
a hobbit in his next movie.

But there are no Jewish hobbits.

Clearly, you've never been to my house
for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.

We are not blackmailing Peter...

 All right, where's the ring?
 You mean my ring?

 What are you doing?
 The ring was unguarded.

It was sitting on the table.
Anyone could've taken it.

Proof? I did.

Give me that.

Be reasonable. We want to do
different things with the ring.

But your ideas are stupid
and I want a Jet Ski.

I found it. The ring is mine.

I don't understand why in this group
I never get my way.

You always get your way.

I'll stipulate to that
if you give me the ring.

Hey. Enjoying your food
that I actually brought you...

instead of promising food
but bringing you a box of random crap?

Yeah, it's delicious.
The sarcasm's a little stale, though.

How about this? Until we figure out
what to do with the ring, Penny holds it.

 What ring?
 This ring.

Looking for something?

 Will you hold this for a couple of days?
 Why?

It's a prop from a movie
and we're kind of fighting over it.

The first piece of jewelry
my boyfriend gives me...

is a prop from a movie
and I don't even get to keep it?

If you had gone out with me years ago...

you'd have my Aunt Ida's brooch...

that she smuggled
out of occupied Belgium in a cat.

How am I looking now?

You hit me!

I'm bleeding!

What was that?

Sheldon tried to take the ring
and I punched him.

That's my girl.

So, Sheldon, how's it feel
to get beaten up by a girl?

It's not the first time.

I have a twin sister
whose assaults began in utero.

If only I'd had the presence of mind
to reabsorb her.

I'd have a mole with hair in it...

instead of a tedious
yearly Christmas letter.

Have you come to the realization...

that the only reasonable action
is to sell the ring and divide the money?

 No.
 I was afraid of that.

Go ahead.

Greetings from Mumbai.

I'm Raj's attorney,
Venkatesh Koothrappali.

Also my cousin.

 You brought a lawyer?
 Don't answer that.

I'll get straight to the point.

My client's prepared to surrender
any interest in the ring...

in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.

We're not giving him two Jet Skis.

Look, we're big boys. Why don't we just
cut to the chase and meet In the middle?

One Kawasaki Jet Ski. Done and done.

No Jet Skis.

All right, forget the Jet Skis.

Forget the Jet Skis? What happened to
"tear them a new one"?

What can I say?
They played hardball. We lost.

 You're useless.
 I told you that when you hired me.

 I'm signing off now.
 Call your mother. She worries.

So you know, if we're bringing
in cousins who are lawyers...

prepare for shock and awe.

You know, I am ending this.
Penny didn't wanna hold the ring.

She gave it to me. I have it.
I'm sending it back.

 Where's the ring?
 You mean this ring?

Be aware of your surroundings
while urinating in a public men's room.

 Give me that.
 No, it's mine.

It's all of ours.

Okay, this is ridiculous.

 Then let go!
 I'm not. You let go.

I say this ring belongs to the last person
who can hold on.

Fine. Can't we go home and start?

Sure. Let go of the ring.

All right. It starts now.

You do realize there's a giant-bug movie
marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel.

Wait, my laptop.

Yeah, there's a point
when this becomes idiotic.

And it wasn't
when we were driving like this?

I would advise the three of you
that resistance is futile.

I have endless patience.

I spent two and a half hours on hold
with Hewlett-Packard customer service...

just to complain
about their customer service.

You wanna talk about endless patience?

Penny made me watch all five seasons
of Sex and the City.

There's six seasons, dude.

Oh, crap.

No, no, no, the sixth season is great.

We go to Paris with Carrie
and get our heart broken...

and then Mr. Big shows up.
We don't know if we can trust him again.

It's a wild ride.

Door.

Okay, everybody, and pli�.

And relev�.

What are you doing?

Last one holding the ring
decides its fate.

I know it sounds silly.

No, no, no. You are my boyfriend.
Nothing you do is silly to me.

Thank you.

FYI, this is a bag from Victoria's Secret.

I'm out.

I'm sorry, Ma,
I have to stay late at the office.

No, he doesn't. He's lying to you.

Will you be quiet?

Well, if you want privacy,
let go of the ring.

I'm so glad we came
to this gentile strip club.

Howard, here's more bacon
to tuck into the shiksa's G-string.

I'll call you back.

It's lovely you call your mommy
and let her know you're going to be late.

From what I know, if a woman
doesn't breast-feed on time...

it's very uncomfortable for her boobies.

Don't you talk
about my mother's boobies.

If you're offended, let go of the ring
and go on home to your mother's boobies.

Excellent. Tire each other out.
The ring will be mine.

Howard, why don't you
go after Raj's mother?

Why don't we go after your mother?

Go ahead.
I have no illusions about my mother.

She is a kind, loving,
religiously fanatical right-wing Texan...

with a slightly out-of-scale head
and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction.

Anything you'd like to add?

That's not gonna get you anywhere.
Better pull out the big gun.

You're right.
Let's talk about your grandmother.

No.

I call no meemaws.

Think about this.

The only way your mother was born
was your meemaw had sex.

 I don't wanna hear this.
 Then let go of the ring and walk away.

 Never.
 All right.

I'll bet your meemaw didn't just have sex
to have your mother...

I bet she had sex...

because she liked it.

 Stop it.
 Yeah. Meemaw did the nasty.

 I said stop it!
RAJESH & HOWARD: Ha-ha-ha.

 We're getting to him.
 Waterfalls.

 What?
 Waterfalls.

Crashing waves, babbling brooks.

 What are you doing?
 Subliminal messaging.

I'm going to make you want to pee.

Dripping faucets.

Leaky gutter.

Peeing.

It's not working, dude.

Oh-ho-ho. It's working, all right.

I have to pee.

 Then let go of the ring and go.
 Actually, I wouldn't mind going too. Heh.

Fine, um, on the count of three.

One, two...

Wait, just to clarify,
when you get to three...

do we stand up or do we pee?

We stand up.

Excellent choice.

Three.

Oh. Something tells me this was a bad day
to wear suede shoes.

I've done it. I've won.

The ring is mine.

It's mine!

We're going to clean it up
and make it pretty.

My own, my love...

my precious.

Where's the ring?

It's in a FedEx box on its way back
to where it came from.

The fires of Mount Doom?

Peter Jackson's office in New Zealand.
It wasn't ours.

You quit the game.
You had no right to take it.

You guys were sleeping. The ring was
on the floor. No one was touching it.

So we start the game over
until there's a winner.

There wasn't ever going to be a winner.

There was going to be a selfish person...

and three people
who used to be his friend.

Is that what you guys want? If it is, fine.

I don't want anything to do with you.

I don't know what happened
in that bathroom, but I'm not cleaning it.

My precious.

I knew it.

 Give us the precious.
 Never! Never.

 Give it to me.
 Get off of me.

 Give me the ring.
 It's mine.

I gotta go back to dating dumb guys
from the gym.

 Give it back.
 Give it to me. Give me the ring!

 I said give it to me.
 It's mine!



And reverse the spin
on the antiproton...

and gamma becomes alpha.

Multiplied by a matrix
of negative I comma zero.

And there we have it.

Conclusive proof that
I am absolutely worthless after 9:00.

Sheldon.

Sheldon.

Hmm.


All right, all right.

I see what's going on.

A little pre-Halloween hijinkery.




A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains,
a witch's cackle.

Trifecta of haunted house clichés.

Instead of "Eek," I say, "Yawn."

Sheldon.

Oh, the walls are dripping blood...

which looks nothing
like a phenolphthalein indicator...

exposed to a sodium carbonate
solution.

"See you in hell, Sheldon."

The most frightening thing about that
is the missing comma.


Okay, heh, all right.

That one was clever.

Skeleton with phosphorous
on a zip line.

Come on out, merry pranksters.
Take a bow.


 You should've seen your face.
 Yes.

There's nothing quite like the slightly
widened eyes of mildly startled.

Come on, admit it. We got you.

Please. Fright depends on
an element of surprise.

The simple fact is,
because I am much smarter than you...

and able to anticipate your actions...

it is highly unlikely that you two rubes
could ever surprise me.

 He's probably right.
 We can't beat him. He's just too smart.

Gentlemen.



Okay, who had money on "faints"?

I had "pee his pants."

Hang on.
Looks like everyone's a winner.


Oh, watch out, Sheldon.

This little boy Casper
is a gh... Gh... Gh... Ghost!

 Ha-ha-ha.
 Droll.

Eh, not as droll as a grown man
passed out in a puddle of his own urine.


That was pretty droll.
With a hint of ammonia.

Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen.

Think you've poked fun
at a milquetoast academic.

You've forgotten one thing.

I am also a son of the Lone Star State.
I'm Texas through and through.

And we know how
to settle scores down there.

If you doubt me, ask Mexico.

Hot girl, 9 o'clock.

Don't everybody look at once.

What is she doing
in a comic book store?

I don't know. She might be lost.

Doesn't matter. Watch and learn.

 Hi.
 Hi.

That's, um...

It... It... It...

Shut up.

 Are you getting this Next Men?
 Uh, yeah.

It's issue number 21,
first appearance of Hellboy.

I know.
I've been looking for it for years.

 Sorry.
 Hey, if I pretended to hit on you...

could I distract you enough
to sneak it away?

Yes, but you'd be using
your superpowers for evil.

Damn, I'm forbidden
by my Kryptonian father to do so.


 I'm Alice.
 Um, Leonard.

You're very cute, Leonard.

Thanks. You too.
You know, go ahead and take it.

No, no, no, I... I did evil.

 Would you be open to a trade?
 Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.

Okay. Here. This is my number.

 Call me.
 Sorry, palm's a little sweaty.

What's that word?

 Alice.
 Oh, right, your name.

That makes more sense than "penis."

Later.

Did we just see you pick up a girl
in a comic book store?

Because if you did, you get your picture
up there on the Wall of Heroes.

No, I don't think I picked her up.
Besides, I have a girlfriend.

Doesn't matter.
This is the closest anyone's ever come.

You're going on the wall, my friend.

Be sure to check the mail.

How many times are you gonna tell me?
What's with you?

Nothing.
It's not suspicious that I'm fixating.

It's consistent with my personality.

 Right.
 Hey, guys.

More Halloween candy? Didn't you just
buy a bunch of it yesterday?

Oh, yeah, that's gone.

It's a rough month when Halloween
and PMS hit at the same time.

Leonard doesn't have time to chat.
He has to get the mail.

Oh, will you relax? I'll get it in a minute.

 Hey, how was work?
 Open the mail.


Excuse me.

A couple of circulars,
nothing important.

 What's with him?
 Hang on.


You might be from Texas,
but I'm from New Jersey.


Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me
two years ago at Comic-Con.

 What are you wearing?
 Well, you know, it's Comic-Con.

I'm Lion-O from ThunderCats.


Wow, you must have gotten so laid.

Heh. No, but Jessica Alba
did rub my furry belly.


Wanna see a comic I draw?

You're kidding.
You have your own book?

 Yeah, it's kind of based on my life.
 Ha, ha. Cool.

Oh, wow, look, there's you having sex...

with a guy in the top half
of a Chewbacca costume.

 Comic-Con?
 You'd think, but no.

You're very talented.
This is really good. Did you do...?

So can I trade you my comic
for the Hellboy?

You can have my car.

Oh, dear.

Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.

 Good morning, Sheldon.
 It is, isn't it?


Oh, bother.

Isn't that just always the way?

You go to staple something
and you're out of staples.

Gosh, I wish I'd known that earlier today
when I was at Staples.

You have a thing of paper clips
right there.

No, no, uh, I need something
more permanent to join these papers.

Say, uh, don't you keep staples
in your top desk drawer?

I don't know, maybe.

Be a lamb and check.

All right.


Who do we have here?

It's a snake. A terrifying snake.

Oh. Did some bad man put us
in a drawer?

Stop talking like that.
You've been rendered speechless by fear.

Let's go to the biology lab
and find you some nice yummy mice.

I tried to scare an Indian with a snake.

Come on, Cooper.
You're better than this.


It's open.

 Hey, you got a minute?
 Yeah, sure. Come on in.

 Thanks.
 Want some mac and cheese?

No. Lactose. Gas.

 Glass of wine?
 No. Sulfites. Migraines.

Well, I'd offer you Halloween candy,
but that's gone.

 So, what's up?
 Okay, we used to go out, right?

Oh, my God.
That's where I know you from.

I'm dealing with a situation
and it's kind of about my love life.

So I know that might be weird
for us to talk about...

but in this area, as you know,
all my other friends are just so stupid.

All right, what's going on?

 So you're okay talking about this?
 Yes.

 Sure it's not weird?
 It's okay.

If you ever wanna talk to me
about a problem in your life with a guy...

then I... I'd be fine with that.

Okay, good.
There's this one guy I used to date...

who's about to be force-fed wine
and cheese if he doesn't get to the point.

Okay, uh, here it is.

Is it cheating
if a guy has a girlfriend...?

Yeah, probably.

 Come on.
 I'm sorry, go ahead.

I met this girl and she's great.
We have a lot in common.

 Did you guys do it?
 No. We just made out a little.

Oh, look at you, you bad boy.

 Did you tell her about Priya?
 Uh, I was gonna...

but there were too many tongues
in my mouth.

That's gross.

Here's the thing. Uh, I... I'm not one
of those guys who sneaks around...

and sleeps with
more than one woman.

Well, good for you.

The problem is
I wanna be one of those guys.

So sleep with the new girl
and lie to Priya.

Oh, that's not who I am.

All right.
Then break it off with the new girl.

Now, let's not do anything rash.
She's really hot.

If you like this girl so much,
just end things with Priya.

Priya and I are in love.
I think we could get married someday.

You're looking for a way
to sleep with both women...

 ...and have everybody be happy about it.
 Now we're getting somewhere.

What does your gut tell you?

"Go ask Penny.
She'll know what to do."

Hello, Howard.

I've realized that you scaring me
was all in jest.

Allow me to say, job well done.




Perfect.

 What are you doing?
 Science. You wouldn't understand.

Okay, well, see you. I'm going out.

I thought you were leaving
the apartment.

Yeah, me too.
I can't make up my mind.

Are you concerned because the world
is filled with big dogs and bullies?

No, I'm having a moral crisis.

Well, if it's of any help, I've read all
the great moral philosophers...

including Dr. Seuss.

Oh, what the hell?

I'm supposed to go see that
girl from the comic book store, Alice.

But I don't know if I should, because I'm
going out with Priya, but she's in India.

All right.
So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity.

Probably won't be relying
on Seuss here.

Although One Fish Two Fish
Red Fish Blue Fish...

might be surprisingly applicable.

 Go on.
 Well, uh, they say at the end of your life...

you regret the stuff you didn't do
more than the stuff that you did.

And I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff
I wanna do.

You know, the German philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche...

believed that morality
is just a fiction...

used by the herd of inferior
human beings...

to hold back the few superior men.

That actually does help.

It's worth noting
that he died of syphilis.

Screw it, I'm going.

On your way home,
will you pick up orange juice?

Do you mind? I'm questioning
a lot of things in my life.

Is one of those things
your fondness for orange juice?

 No.
 Great. Tropicana, no pulp.


 Hey, Sheldon.

It's me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.

That's not my mom. It's Bernadette.

Really? That's very unsettling.

 Hi, Sheldon.
 Hi.

 What's up?
 It just occurred to me...

that I never formally congratulated you
on your pending nuptials.

I hopped on the first bus and hightailed
it down here to shake your hand.

Put her there, you old so-and-so.

Well, uh... I'm gonna see you
at work in 12 hours.

Don't you think
it could have waited until then?

Holy smoke,
why didn't I think of that?

You're a better man than I,
Howard Wolowitz.

You put her there, you son of a gun.

Whatever. Heh.


My...

It's...

Oh, my God, Howie!
What did you do?

It was a harmless Halloween prank.
Look.

Howard has a heart condition.
You know that.

Well, I thought he made that up.

Isn't hypochondria a common
idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?

This is adrenaline.
We're gonna inject it into his heart.

 We are?
 You are. I'm not strong enough...

to get it through his chest plate
and we've only got one shot.

Oh, no, I can't!

Hurry! We're running out of time!

 Okay.
 Just do it!

Oh, God! One, two, three.

Aah!

Trick or treat, bubbeleh.

What?


No. You mean this was all a ruse?

Oh, how could I be so stu...?



Damn it, I can't... I can't do this.

Is it my tongue stud?

If that freaks you out,
you're in for a real surprise later.

No, no, no. I can't do this.

Believe me, I really want to.

 But?
 But I kind of have a girlfriend.

 Are you kidding?
 Uh, you're cool with being friends, right?

Heh. I don't believe this.

Wait, I don't... Which part?

Heh. I'm so stupid.
I thought for once I'd met a good guy...

 ...but you're just another jackass.
 Oh, no, you have it wrong.

No, I was going to be a jackass,
but I stopped myself.

I stayed a good guy,
so I'm gonna pass on the sex.

But you should know,
that's not a comment on your hotness...

but on my goodness.

That's kind of my superpower.
I'm... I'm like Captain Good Guy.


It's okay. Did the right thing.

You idiot!

 Hey, Priya.
 Hey, sweetheart. How's it going?

Uh. Not so good. We have to talk.

Oh. Sounds serious. What's up?

Okay, uh, here it is.

I met this girl and I kissed her
and I feel terrible about it.

But it's done,
it's never gonna happen again...

and I am so, so sorry.

Leonard, relax. It's okay.

 It is?
 Yeah, these things happen.

They happen to everybody.

Oh, my God, you are amazing.
I mean, heh, I don't deserve you.

What... What do you mean, "everybody"?

Leonard, I didn't know if
I should tell you...

but I kind of cheated on you too.

Uh, you... "Kind of"?

A couple of weeks ago,
I slept with my ex-boyfriend.

So I guess we both messed up a little.

No, no, I messed up a little.
You messed up a lot.

Well, it's not a competition.

Oh, yeah, it is and you won.

I'm sorry, I have to go.

I don't believe this.


Buzzinga, punk. Now we're even.



I don't see anything at all,Sheldon.

Well,you're the doctor, but I am
constantly hearing this annoying sound.

Me,too.

Is it a high-frequency whistle?

No,it's more of a relentless,
narcissistic drone.

Yup,there's no
inflammation at all,Sheldon.

Then it must be a tumor.

Seriously doubt it.

Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection
from all those childhood toilet swirlies.

Is that possible?

I used to get those all the time.

Even in church.

Well,if it is from a swirly,
there something I can do.

Okay,circle, circle,dot,dot,
now you have a cootie shot!

 I'm going to bed.
 Okay,I'll be right in.

It's not enough that she mocks me,but that isn't
even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.

Do you understand that Stephanie's not
here to treat your imaginary ailments?

How is it imaginary that I keep
hearing an octave above Middle C?

Is that imaginary?

I don't think so.

 Good night.
 Another thing.

Under Article One,Section
Three of our Roommate Agreement,

I'm calling an emergency meeting.

No,you're not.

Leonard moves the meeting
not occur. Is there a second?

None heard,the motion fails.

I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on
the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.

Thank you.

That being said, we have to discuss the
implementation of the agreed upon "cohabitation" rider

which has been activated now that
the two of you are living together.

We're not living together.

I beg to disagree.

"A girlfriend shall be deemed
quote living with un-quote Leonard

when she has stayed over
for A:ten consecutive nights,

or B: more than nine nights
in a three week period,

or C: all the weekends of a
given month plus three weeknights.

That's absurd.

You initialed it. See? L.H.,L.H.,L.H.

Wait,I only initialed it because
I never thought it would happen!

I initialed another clause naming you
my sidekick in case I get superpowers.

Hmm,yes,you did.

Now,to review,the following
provisions are hereby activated:

In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having
two separate shelves and one communal shelf,

the three of us now get individual
shelves and the door becomes communal.

Next,apartment vacuuming shall be
increased from two to three times a week

to accommodate the increased
accumulation of dead skin cells.

Third,the bhroom schedule.

Now,I'm given to understand women have
different needs,so, we'll have to discuss that.

I'm going to bed.

At least take this with you.

Look,and have Stephanie
initial here,here,here,here...

and... here.

This states that she does not now nor does she
intend to play a percussive or brass instrument.

Sure sounds like a tumor
pressing on the auditory nerve.



No,absolutely not.

It's not a big deal.
We have latex gloves.

I don't care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend
is not going to give you a prostate exam.

Hi,Sheldon.

Good morning, Dr. Stephanie.

I ust Leonard satisfied
you sexually last night.

Sheldon,we don't ask
questions like that.

I heard you ask it over and over.

How is it inappropriate
for me to ask it once?

He did very nicely.

See? She's not offended.

And now you finally have an answer.

Out of coffee. Need coffee.

Oh,hello.

Stephanie,right?

And-And-
And you are?

Penny,I live across the hall.

I've heard a lot about you.

Really?

I haven't heard a thing about you.

Leonard?

Why haven't I heard a thing about
this woman who lives across the hall

and comes into your
apartment in the morning...

in her underwear?

She's heard about you because
we're,you know, involved

and you haven't heard
about her because...

I never slept with her,I swear!

In Leonard's defense,it
wasn't for lack of trying.

Thank you,Sheldon.

You're welcome,Leonard.

Look,I'm just saying,um...

Penny is one of our many neighbors,you
know, and in our building,

neighbors come and go,it's
very casual,no dress code.

In fact,some mornings I'll just mosey
down to the third floor in my pajamas

and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

Really? I have never once been invited
to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

She doesn't like you.

You have a gall bladder to remove
and I have to get in the shower

and Penny has clothes to put on,so...

Well,it was very nice meeting you.

Nice to finally meet you,too.

 And I'll see you
tonight? - Okay,bye-bye.

What could I possibly have
done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?

So,that's Stephanie,huh?

Why do I feel like I'm the one
that just got the prostate exam?

You know,she seems very nice.

Oh,she is. She's terrific.

And she's proving to
be a valuable roommate.

Roommate? You guys are living together?

Like hippies.

We're not living together.

Do I have to pull out
the paperwork again?

We're not living together.

Are you sure?

How could I not be sure?

Well,let's find out.

Don't you think if a woman was living with
me I'd be the first one to know about it?

Oh,sweetie,you'd be the
last one to know about it.

Hmm,cute dresses.

I bet this looks great on you!

We're not living together.

Okay,hmm...

Scented candles, fuzzy
slippers, Floral bed sheets?

We're not living together.

Okay,moving on.

Now,who are these guys at Disney World?

Uh,the big dog is Goofy,

but the older couple with
the mouse ears,I have no idea.

We're not living together!

You're going to go down swinging,huh?

All right,well,we got your body lotion,

your InStyle Magazine,your jewelry box.

We're
not...

Where's my Bat Signal?

You have a Bat Signal?

I did.

It was right here.

She
must've...

Oh,my God,we're living together.

Really? What was your first clue?

New pants?

Yeah,Stephanie got them for me.

Nice. Cotton?

Actually,I think it's more
of a wool,fire ant blend.

So,the girlfriend's
buying clothes for you,huh?

 Sounds serious.
 It is actually.

In fact,I gave it a lot of thought and I
decided it was time for us to live together.

Oh,Leonard,huge mistake.

There's a whole buffet of women out there
and you're just standing in the corner

eating the same deviled
egg over and over again.

At least I have an
egg. What do you have?

A veritable smorgasbord of
potential sexual partners.

See the blonde over there?

I can hit on her and you can't.

So,go hit on her.

She's not my type.

Too bad,'cause she was
checking you out before.

 She was?
 Of course not. Look at her.

I don't care what you guys think.

Stephanie and I are very
happy living together.

I will give either of you 20
dollars,right now to trade pants with me.

Sheldon,what are you doing here?

Hang on.

130 over 80.

A little high.

We can attribute that to the stress
of sneaking past the security desk.

Where did you get the stethoscope
and the blood pressure cuff?

My aunt Marion gave them
to me for my 12th birthday.

She thought if I failed at theoretical physics
that I should have a trade to fall back on.

And by the way,the blood pressure
cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.

I know.

Didn't they teach you
that in medical school?

 I'm busy here,Sheldon.
 I understand.

All I need is for you
to authorize these tests.

A cardiac stress test,a full body MRI,an
electromyogram,a CBC,baseline glucose.

Upper GI?

Oh,and an exploratory laparoscopy.

Last time I had hiccups,it felt like my
diaphragm was just going through the motions.

Go home,Sheldon.

Can I at least have the upper GI?

I already drank the barium!

Oh,good. Do you have
any fabric softener?

Yeah,sure.

What are you washing? A crocodile?

No,the pants that Stephanie got me.

Oh,sweetie,you can't machine
wash these. They'll be ruined.

 Are you sure?
 Absolutely.

Oh,no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.

Are you guys having problems?

No,everything's fine.

Really?

Yeah,it's wonderful.

Okay,maybe this whole living together happened
kind of suddenly,but it's fine,it's great.

Okay,Leonard,honey,you know,if you're
uncomfortable with the way things are going,

you're allowed to say something.

Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.

Believe me,your feelings are
just as important as hers.

No,that doesn't sound right either.

Just tell her you need the relationship to move
at a pace that you both are comfortable with.

Yeah,I could say
something like that to her.

I'll go do that.

 Thank you.
 Sure.

You ve a really good grasp on this.

Maybe you could talk to her?

You're kidding,right?

No,but that's okay.

I'll go talk to her.

Want to come with?

Go!

 Oh,no.
 Whaa?

You were right. ur larynx
is terribly inflamed.

I mean,I've never seen anything like it.

I knew it!

What do I do?

You're going to need to
stop talking immediately.

 For how...
 Dut-dut-dut.

Immediately.

 Oh,hi,honey.
 Sheldon.

What's going on?

I just performed a "Sheldonectomy. "

Careful,if you don't get it
all,it'll only come back woe.

Gotcha.

Listen,we need to talk.

Do we need to talk or
"do we need to talk"?

I don't know what that means.

Okay,why don't you just tell me
what it is you have to tell me?

Okay,um,well,look,it's just that...

things between you and me
have been going pretty quick.

And...

It's just a little scary.

Well,yeah,but scary good,right?

Sure...

When is scary not good?

But...

okay,um,I have feelings,right?

Okay,and it's perfectly okay
to express those feelings,right?

Of course,honey,why don't you
tell me what it is you're feeling?

Okay,we,I ju... I think it's important
to remember that we move at a pace

that is our
speed and...

Oh,shoot,I had it!

Okay,how about this? How about
I tell you what I'm feeling?

What's that?

Really? Right now?

Why not?

I just ate,aren't you
supposed to wait an hour?

I think that's for swimming.

Oh,okay.

I just hope I don't get cramps.

 Oh,I put your clothes in the dryer.
 Thank you.

 Your pants are ruined.
 Good.

So,how did the talk with Stephanie go?

Well,um,on one level,really,really well.

So,you told her you
wanted to slow things down?

Not specifically,but,uh,I did
tell her that I had feelings.

Good,good.

And then what?

And then,uh,the subject
got changed somehow.

You had sex,didn't you?

little bit.

 What?
 Nothing.

Okay,well,it sounds like
things are going to work out.

Yeah,it's all good.
Everything's going to work out.

One way or another.

God,come on,Leonard,You are entitled to try
and make things go the way you want them to.

 Really?
 Yes!

You don't always have to go
along with what the woman wants.

 What?
 Nothing. Just...

rethinking my whole life.

Okay,here's the thing.

I'm afraid that if I ask her
to move out,she'll just dump me.

Well,it's a chance you have to take.

I mean,look,if it's
meant to be,it'll be.

Very comforting.

Okay,so what do I say to her?

I don't know.

I mean,what have women said to you when
they wanted to slow a relationship down?

I really like you,but I want
to see how things go with Mark?

Yeah,that'll slow it down.

I'm sorry,I totally inteupted
you. What we you sang?

Oh,right,yeah,um.

So,Stephanie,hereththing.

I really like yo

Oh,God,here comes the speech.

What speech?

"I really like you but maybe we sh
spend a little less time together"

"'cause I need mspace but
I'll call you on Tuesday

and then you never
call me so I call you,"

but you don't call me back and then
when I run into you at the coffee shop,

you pretend like you've been
having problems with your voice mail

and I know that you're lying,

but I pretend like I don't care
even though I'm dying inside!

No!

No,no!

I wasn't going to say any of that.

I was just going to say...

I really like you.

Oh,good!

'Cause I really like you,too.

Terrific.

Nice sweater.

Yeah,Stephanie got it
for me. It's kind of fun.

It's got a big bird on it,dude.

Yeah,yeah,that's the fun part.

We're also getting new curtains
for my bedroom,and a dust ruffle,

and a duvet,and I don't
even know what a duvet is,

but I'm pretty sure if I
did I wouldn't want one,

but every time I talk
to her about moving out,

she cries and we have sex.

You're lucky. With me,it's
usually the other way around.

You know,if you can't talk to
her,why don't you just text her?

Isn't that kind of cowardly?

Oh,yeah. It's beyond contemptible.

Sold.

"I think it would be better for our
relationship if you moved back to your place. "

There. It's done.

Good for you.

Yeah, good for me.

I'll never have sex again.

Hmm, I was wrong. See ya.

Penny.

Penny.

Penny.

Sheldon?

I have an inflamed larynx.

Okay?

We're out of herbal
tea. Do you have any?

Okay, let me check.

Some hiney would be nice, too.

Hiney?

Honey.



Hey, you guys ready to order?

Uh, sure.
Okay, Priya?

Uh, I'll have
the shepherd's pie.

You want to split
that with me?

Oh, no, no, no,
he doesn't.

Why not?

Well, you have milk in
the taters,

milk in the gravy,
parmesan crust.

Your lactose-intolerant
boyfriend will turn

into a gas-filled
Macy's Day balloon.

Not quite accurate. The Macy's
balloons are filled with helium,

whereas Leonard produces copious
amounts of methane.

So, no, on the shepherd's pie.
Can we move on?

Yeah, a little tip:
he says he can eat frozen yogurt.

Do not believe it.

Sea bass!
I'll have the sea bass!

You gotta like this,

the girlfriend and the
ex-girlfriend bonding

over your rooty-tooty
stinky booty.

Kill me.

It wouldn't help.
The human body is capable

of being flatulent for hours
after death.

Guys, sorry I'm late.
I have amazing news.

Bernadette, before you
change the subject,

does anyone have any
final comments on

Leonard's faulty
digestive system?

So, what's your news,
Bernadette?

The thesis committee accepted
my doctoral dissertation.

I'm getting my PhD!

Wow!
Oh, congratulations.

Wow, so that means you're a
doctor, you're a doctor,

you're a doctor,
you're a doctor,

and Howard,
you know a lot of doctors.

Congratulations, honey.

Thank you.

So, Howard, tell us,
how's it feel knowing

that when you two get married,

you'll be referred to
as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?

Unless he takes Bernadette's
last name.

And considering
her advanced status,

that could open
some doors for him.

Please, this isn't about me.
I'm proud of you.

Well, you'll be
really be proud of this.

I was headhunted by a big
pharmaceutical company.

They're gonna pay me
a buttload of money!

What?

Bernadette, that's great.

Howard, do you make a buttload?

Better than what you've
got a buttload of.

Hey, if I roll down the windows
in the car, everything's peachy.

If you do it,
you're still not a doctor.

Yeah, just a heads-up
on the car window deal.

It helps, but everything is
not "peachy."




 Oh, if there was a problem,
you can't solve it 

 Check out the hook
while my DJ revolves it 

 Ice, Ice, baby 

 Ice, Ice, baby 

Oh, God, I feel
ridiculous in this dress.

You look beautiful,
Lieutenant Uhura.

Now prepare for... inspection.

Shh, my brother's
going to hear you.

Relax, he's got
headphones on.

And we're ten miles above
Earth in a starship.

Really, ten miles?

You're orbiting inside
the atmosphere?

Moron.

I can't believe
I'm wearing

my brother's Halloween costume.

I can't believe you think
he only wears it on Halloween.

Open the landing bay doors,
shuttle craft approaching.

Okay, gotta go.

Hey, what's up?

Is that my future
daughter-in-law, the doctor?!

No, Ma! It's Raj!

He's a doctor
too, right?!

Yes!

Like Leonard and
the skinny weirdo!

Sheldon, yes!

Everybody's a doctor but me!

Well, whose fault
is that?!

What's up?

Leonard's putting disgusting
memories in

my memory foam mattress.

Can I stay here tonight?

Sure, but I'm going out
with Bernadette.

It'll just be you and my mother.

I guess that's okay.

Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!

Of course, he and I
can play doctor!

She's kidding, right?

I don't know, she's pretty
feisty since

they put her on
hormone-replacement therapy.

Paging Dr.
Cutie Pie!

I must say, Amy,
I was very impressed

to see that Bernadette got
her PhD.

It's indeed admirable.

Although, it is...
microbiology.

Your doctorate is in
neurobiology.

I fail to see the distinction.

I'll make it simple for you.

I study the brain,

the organ responsible for
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

Bernadette studies yeast,

the organism responsible
for Michelob Lite.

Is there something wrong
with your neck?

It's a little stiff.

What a remarkably fragile
structure

to support
such a valuable payload.

Not unlike balancing a Faberge
egg on a Pixie Stick.

Have you considered massage?

I'd like to respond
to that sarcastically:

Yes, I relish the thought
of a stranger covering my body

with oil and rubbing it.

I was proposing you massage your
muscles with your own hands.

Still sounds like a lot
of unnecessary touching.

Trust me. With your right hand,
locate the spot

where the scapula meets
the acromion process.

All right.

Now push your third finger along
the ridge of the shoulder blade,

making a small rotation
as you do so.

Rotating.

You should feel
a small node-like object

rolling back and forth along
the bone.

You mean the myofascial point?

Obviously.

Now bear down on it like
the seventh grade noogies

we all know too well.

Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes,
oh, yes!

Amy, I've never been touched
like this before!

Oh! My hands are magic!

Don't flatter yourself.

Your hands are blunt tools
guided by my knowledge

of the nervous system.

I could just as easily have
paralyzed you.

There's someone at my door.

That doesn't interest me.
Good-bye.

 Can I sleep here tonight?
 Why?

Leonard's having
astronomically inaccurate

Star Trek sex with my sister.

I can see how that would be
upsetting. Come in.

I'll get the sheets
and blankets for the couch.

Oh, don't bother.
I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.

No, I can't authorize that.

Well, he's in my bed.
Why can't I be in his?

The Hammurabic Code is
"an eye for an eye,"

not "a bed for a bed."

Come on, dude, I'm exhausted,
and Tyra Banks says

the most important item in your
makeup bag is

a good night's sleep.

All right.

This is a form
indemnifying me

from your use of
"Leonard's bedroom."

that I tried to stop you

and did so using
a stern facial expression.

Good night, Sheldon.

Wait. Not yet.

We still have to go over
safety procedures.

Now, the apartment has three
emergency exits located

here, here, and here.

In the event of a power outage,

luminous paint will guide you
to the nearest exit.

You're kidding.

I never kid about safety.

What are you doing here?

I was sleeping.

In my bed?

Well, I would've slept
in my own bed,

but it was being used
to bring shame to my family.

And the memory
of Gene Roddenberry.

Oh, you heard?

"Scotty, I need more power."

Sorry. Does Sheldon know
you're sleeping in here?

Are you kidding?
He made me sign a waiver,

participate in
an emergency fire drill

and take a refresher course
in CPR.

Thank God he had a dummy.

Oh, yeah.
Mouth-to-Mouth Mona.

You know,
she used to date Howard?

Oh, my God, she's that Mona?

Why can't you and my sister
spend your nights here?

We tried. She doesn't get along
with Sheldon.

Sheldon doesn't get along
with Sheldon.

It's still no reason
for me to have to listen to you

arm your
photon torpedoes every night.

Okay, well, how about this:
until Priya gets her own place,

you stay here and I'll stay at
your apartment.

Can I bring girls here?

You?

Sure. Bring as many as you want.

Okay, deal.

Just not against their will.

You really think you should be
eating that cake?

Why?

If you're gonna be

a trophy husband
for a rich wife,

you might want
to watch your waistline.

He's right.

A minute on the lips,
a lifetime on the hips.

Yeah, ha-ha.

First of all, I'm not threatened
by my fiancée's success.

I'm proud of her.

And secondly,
I have my own career.

Until you have kids.

Good news, Raj.

I got the blood work
back from the lab.

You're okay to stay for a while.

When did you take my blood?

Not important.

Your sugar was a little high.

I'd follow up
with your regular physician.

In the meantime, I have some
paperwork here

for you to go over.

What the hell is this?

Boilerplate stuff.

A modified roommate agreement
for a temporary house guest.

And a living will and durable
power of attorney.

This says you can make
nd o of li" decisions for me.

As your friend, let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

Please sign.

Did you sign this?

There's a reciprocity
clause.

You get to pull
the plug on him, too.

Well, that seems fair.

Congratulations and welcome
temporarily aboard.

Here's your I.D. card,

your key and your lapel pin.

Which Leonard was
too cool to wear.

FYI, part of your
responsibilities

as roommate pro tem
will be to drive me

to and from work, the comic book
store, the barbershop

and the park for one hour every
other Sunday for fresh air.

Bring a ball or a Frisbee,

you know, something
he can chase.

Also, you're tasked
with bringing home

all takeout dinners.

Tonight is Thai food.

You'll find the standard order
in appendix B

or downloadable
from my FTP server.

If you have
any questions,

here's the FAQ sheet,

or if you prefer
the human touch,

I do a live web chat called
"Apartment Talk"

on Tuesday nights.

No backsies.

Sheldon, dinner!

What is this?

This is the difference
between

eating and dining.

Remarkable.
I'm just realizing how much

Leonard's been skating by
all these years.

It's not a big thing.

Just think of me as
a brown Martha Stewart.

Hey, Sheldon,

did you change
your Wi-Fi password again?

Yes, it's "Penny, get your
own Wi-Fi." No spaces.

Thanks.

Wow! What's with
the fancy spread?

My new roommate
is bending over backwards

to ingratiate himself to me.

Uh, nice touch,
by the way.

What do you mean "new roommate"?
What happened to Leonard?

The same thing that happened
to Homo erectus.

He was replaced
by a superior species.

I'm the new Homo in town.

That came out wrong.

All right, let me try this
again. Where's Leonard?

He's living at my place,
so I'm living here.

You're living here
provisionally.

But I must say
it's looking good.

Oh Leonard and Priya
are living together?

That's big.

No. Origami napkin swans...

that's the headline.

It's a good thing.

So do you know what kind
of research you'll be doing

at this pharmaceutical
company?

Well, there are a couple of
opportunities available,

but I volunteered for the
premature ejaculation project.

I mean, it's not like either
one of us has heart disease.

Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you a little present.

Oh, Bernie, no.
You didn't have to.

I wanted to.
Come on, open it.

You bought me a Rolex?

How much did this cost?

Oh, you let me worry
about the money.

I just want my baby
to have pretty things.

More wine?

Oh, no, no, no. I've had
way too much already.

Here's an interesting
fact about alcohol...

Hit me.

Man is not the only species

that ferments fruit
in order to become intoxicated.

Can you guess what the other is?

sometimes they pack
the alcohol

in their trunks.

Monkeys.

When does a monkey
have a trunk?

When a suitcase just won't do.

Mmm, all right.

It would appear as if alcohol

is playing keep-away
with your intelligence.

Good night.

Please note,
it is now past 10:00 p.m.

Per our roommate agreement,
kindly refrain

from raucous laughter,

clinking of glasses,
and celebratory gunfire.

Okay...

explain something to me.

You watch Leonard put up with
that guy for years and years.

What has to break inside
your brain for you to think,

"Oh, Krishna, I've got to
get me some of that"?

Well, it's a lot better than

having to wear noise-cancelling
headphones in my own apartment.

What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah.

Leonard's a noisy little dude
in the sack.

Every night.
Really?

Even during allergy season,
when he has to alternate

between kissing and breathing?

It's my sister. Can we not
talk about this anymore?

Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

Can I tell you a secret?

Yeah.

I screwed up.

Leonard's a great guy.

Never should have
broken up with him.

Well, uh, to paraphrase

"It's better to have
loved and lost

"than to stay home every night
and download

increasingly shameful
pornography."

Ohh... you poor baby.

What's wrong with me, Penny?

Nothing, nothing.

You know, if we weren't friends,

and you hadn't brought up
that creepy pornography story,

I'd be on you like

the speed of light squared
on matter to make energy.

Hey, you totally got that right!

"E=mc2."

I listen.

I have no idea what it means,
but I listen.

To friendship.
To friendship.

Would you booze hounds
please stop that infernal clinking?!

And the answer
was elephant!

Mmm.

Mmm.

Leonard, sweetheart, we're
kissing, not eating hot soup.

Sorry.

That's my parents
on video chat.

Go hide
in the bedroom.

Oh, come on!

Why don't we just tell
them that we're dating?

Oh, we've been through this.
It's not the time.

When is the time?

I've got five brothers
and sisters.

One of them is bound
to screw up real big,

and then I'll tell my parents
about you. Now, shoo.

Fine.

Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.

We heard there was a tornado
in Kansas City.

Is that close to you?

No.

Where is your brother?

Out with friends.

I don't like it, a young girl
alone in an apartment.

I'll sleep so much better when
you move back here next month.

You're moving
back to India?!

Who's that?

Oh, my God! There's someone
in your apartment.

Call the police in America!

When were you going
to tell me about this?

Oh, hello, Leonard.

What a pleasant surprise!

Mummy, Daddy, you remember
Rajesh's friend Leonard.

I thought you said Rajesh
was out with his friends.

He has many friends.

Rajesh has many friends?

Why are you lying to us?

She's lying because she doesn't
want you to know we're dating.

Leonard!

Well, what difference
does it make? If you're

moving back to India,
we're obviously breaking up.

You know what?

I don't want to deal
with this right now.

So...

Hot in India?

Of course it is.
It always is. It's India.

Now, what do you have
to say for yourself?

Uh...

That is a beautiful tapestry.

Oh, God.

Oh, God!

Oh.

Okay, look.

This never happened.

Do you understand me?

Really?! Still
can't talk to me?

What are you
doing here?

What?

I said, what are you doing here?

I live here.

I have paperwork
that says differently.

Priya's going back to India.

Irrelevant.

Rajesh and I have
a good thing going

and you're not going to ruin it.

What are you doing here?

I've been up all night.

 I had a fight with Bernadette.
 Why?

She gave me
a beautiful watch.

Leonard, do you
understand this?

Yes.

Talk to him.

Damn.

What's going on?

Oh...

It's-it's not what
it looks like.

What does it look like?



with two slits in it and either is observed...

it will not go through both.
If unobserved, it will.

If it's observed after it left the plane,
before it hits its target...

 ...it will not have gone through both slits.
 Agreed.


There's no point,
I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt.

 Excuse me.
 Hang on.

One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov.

Twenty-six across is MCM.

Fourteen down is...

Move your finger.

phylum, which makes 14 across
Port-Au-Prince.

See, Papa Doc's capital idea,
that's Port-Au-Prince.

Haiti.

 Can I help you?
 Yes.

Um, is this the high-IQ sperm bank?

If you have to ask,
maybe you shouldn't be here.

I think this is the place.

 Fill these out.
 Thank you.

 We'll be right back.
 Oh, take your time.

I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.

Oh, wait.

Leonard, I don't think I can do this.

What, are you kidding? You're a semipro.

No. We are committing genetic fraud.

There's no guarantee our sperm's
going to generate high-IQ offspring.

Think about that.

I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix
who hostesses at Fuddruckers.

Sheldon, this was your idea.

A little extra money to get
fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment?

I know.
And I do yearn for faster downloads.

There's some poor woman
who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

What if she winds up with a toddler
who doesn't know if he should use...

a differential to solve for the area
under a curve?

 I'm sure she'll still love him.
 I wouldn't.

Well, what do you wanna do?

 I want to leave.
 Okay.

 What's the protocol for leaving?
 I don't know.

I've never reneged
on a proffer of sperm before.

Let's try just walking out.

Okay.

 Bye.
 Bye-bye.

Nice meeting you.

 Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
 No.

You wanna hear an interesting thing
about stairs?

Not really.

If the height of a step is off
by as little as two millimeters...

 ...most people will trip.
 I don't care.

Two millime...? That doesn't seem right.

It's true.
I did a series of experiments when I was 12.

My father broke his clavicle.

Is that why they sent you
to boarding school?

No. That was the result
of my work with lasers.


I go ahead and smile

New neighbor?

Evidently.

Significant improvement
over the old neighbor.

Two-hundred pound transvestite
with a skin condition? Yes, she is.

Oh, hi.

 Hi.
 Hi.

Hi?

We don't mean to interrupt.
We live across the hall.

Oh, that's nice.

No. We don't live together. I mean...

we live together, but in separate,
heterosexual bedrooms.

Okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbor.

 Penny.
 Leonard. Sheldon.

 Hi.
 Hi.

Hi.

Well...

Oh, welcome to the building.

Oh, thank you.
Maybe we can have coffee sometime.

 Oh, great.
 Great.

 Great.
 Great.

Well, bye.

 Bye.
 Bye.

Should we have invited her for lunch?

No. We're gonna start season two
of Battlestar Galactica.

We already watched
the season two DVDs.

Not with commentary.

I think we should be good neighbors.

Invite her over, make her feel welcome.

We never invited Louie/Louise over.

Well, and that was wrong of us.

We need to widen our circle.

I have a very wide circle.

I have 212 friends on MySpace.

Yes, and you've never met one of them.

That's the beauty of it.

I'm gonna invite her over.

We'll have a nice meal and chat.

Chat? We don't chat,
at least not off-line.

Well, it's not difficult.

You just listen to what she says...

and then you say something appropriate
in response.

To what end?

 Hi. Again.
 Hi.

 Hi.
 Hi.

Anyway...

we brought home Indian food...

and I know that
moving can be stressful...

and I find
that when I'm undergoing stress...

that good food
and company can have a comforting effect.

Also, curry's a natural laxative and
I don't have to tell you that, you know...

a clean colon is just one less thing
to worry about.

I'm no expert,
but in the context of a lunch invitation...

you might wanna skip the reference
to bowel movements.

Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?

Yes.

Oh, that's so nice. I'd love to.

Great.

So, what do you guys do for fun
around here?

Well, today we tried masturbating
for money.

 Okay, well, make yourself at home.
 Okay.

 Thank you.
 You're very welcome.

You're very welcome.

This looks like some serious stuff.
Leonard, did you do this?

Actually, that's my work.

Wow.

Yeah, well, it's just some
quantum mechanics...

with a little string theory doodling
around the edges. That part's just a joke.

It's a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

So you're, like, one of those
Beautiful Mind genius guys.

Yeah.

This is really impressive.

I have a board, if you like boards.
This is my board.

Holy smokes.

If by "holy smokes," you mean
a derivative restatement of the stuff...

you can find scribbled on the wall
of any men's room at MIT, sure.

 What?
 Oh, come on.

Who hasn't seen this differential below
"here I sit brokenhearted"?

At least I didn't have to invent 26
dimensions just to make the math come out.

 I didn't invent them. They're there.
 In what universe?

In all of them, that is the point.

Do you guys mind if I start?

 Penny.
 Yeah?

That's where I sit.

So sit next to me.

 No, I sit there.
 What's the difference?

 What's the difference?
 Here we go.

In winter, that seat is close enough
to the radiator to remain warm...

yet not so close
as to cause perspiration.

In the summer, it's in a cross breeze created
by opening windows there and there.

It faces the television at an angle that is
neither direct, discouraging conversation...

nor so far wide
as to create a parallax distortion.

I could go on,
but I think I've made my point.

Do you want me to move?

 Well...
 Just sit somewhere else.

Fine.

Sheldon, sit.

Ah.

Well, this is nice.
We don't have a lot of company over.

That's not true.
Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over.

Yes, I know.

Tuesday night we played Klingon Boggle
until 1 in the morning.

 Yeah, I remember.
 I resent you saying we don't have company.

 That has a negative social implication.
 I said I'm sorry.

So...

Klingon Boggle?

Yeah. It's like regular Boggle,
but in Klingon.

That's probably enough about us.
So tell us about you.

Me? Okay.

I'm a Sagittarius, which probably tells you
way more than you need to know.

Yes, it tells us that you participate
in the mass cultural delusion...

that the sun's position relative
to arbitrary constellations...

at the time of your birth
somehow affects your personality.

Participate in the what?

I think what Sheldon's trying to say...

is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been
our first guess.

Oh, yeah, a lot of people
think I'm a water sign.

Okay, let's see, what else?

Oh, I'm a vegetarian.

No, except for fish,
and the occasional steak. I love steak.

Well, that's interesting.

Leonard can't process corn.

So do you have some sort of a job?

Oh, yeah.

I'm a waitress
at The Cheesecake Factory.

I love cheesecake.

 You're lactose intolerant.
 I don't eat it, I think it's a good idea.

Anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay.

It's about this sensitive girl who comes
to L.A. from Lincoln, Nebraska...

to be an actress and winds up
a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.

So it's based on your life.

No, I'm from Omaha.

If that was a movie, I would go see it.

I know, right?

Okay, let's see, what else?

I guess that's about it.

That's the story of Penny.

Well, it sounds wonderful.

It was.

Until I fell in love with a jerk.

What is happening?

I don't know.

Oh, God, you know,
four years I lived with him.

Four years.
That's like as long as high school.

It took you four years
to get through high school?

I just... I can't believe I trusted him.

Should I say something?
I feel I should say something.

You? No, you'll only make it worse.

You wanna know the most pathetic part?

Even though I hate his lying,
cheating guts...

I still love him.

Is that crazy?

Yes.

No, it's not crazy. It's a...

It's a paradox.

Paradoxes are part of nature.
I mean, think about light.

If you look at Huygens, light is a wave,
as confirmed by the double-slit experiments.

But then, along comes Albert Einstein...

and discovers that light
behaves like particles too.

Well, I didn't make it worse.

Oh, I'm so sorry I'm such a mess.

And on top of everything else,
I'm all gross from moving...

and my stupid shower doesn't work.

Our shower works.

Really? Would it be totally weird
if I used it?

 Yes.
 No.

 No?
 No.

No.

It's right down the hall.

Okay, thanks.

You guys are really sweet.

Well, this is an interesting development.

How so?

It has been some time...

since we've had a woman
take her clothes off in our apartment.

That's not true.
Remember at Thanksgiving...

my grandmother with Alzheimer's
had that episode?

Point taken. It has been some time since
we've had a woman take her clothes off...

after which
we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.

The worst part
was watching her carve that turkey.

So, what exactly
are you trying to accomplish here?

Excuse me?

That woman in there
is not going to have sex with you.

Well, I'm not trying to have sex with her.

Oh, good.
Then you won't be disappointed.

What makes you think
she wouldn't have sex with me?

I'm a male and she's a female.

Yes, but not of the same species.

I'm not gonna engage
in hypotheticals here.

 I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
 Oh, of course.

That's not to say that
if a carnal relationship were to develop...

that I wouldn't participate.

However briefly.

Do you think this possibility
will be hindered...

when she discovers your Luke Skywalker
"no more tears" shampoo?

It's Darth Vader shampoo.


Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.

 Wait till you see this.
 It's fantastic. Unbelievable.

See what?

It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT
in 1974.

This isn't a good time.

It's before he became...

a creepy computer voice.

 That's great, you guys have to go.
 Why?

 It's just not a good time.
 Leonard has a lady over.

Your grandmother back in town?

No.

And she's not a lady,
she's just a new neighbor.

Hang on, there really is a lady here?

 Uh-huh.
 And you want us out...

because you're anticipating coitus?

 I'm not anticipating coitus.
 So she's available for coitus?

Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?

Technically,
that would be coitus interruptus.

Hey, is there a trick
to getting it to switch from tub to shower?

Oh, hi, sorry.

Hello.

Enchanté, mademoiselle.

Howard Wolowitz,
CalTech Department of Applied Physics.

You may be familiar
with some of my work.

It's currently orbiting
Jupiter's largest moon...

taking high-resolution
digital photographs.

Penny. I work at
The Cheesecake Factory.

 I'll show you the trick with the shower.
 Okay.


I'm sorry?

It's French for "good shower."

It's a sentiment I can express
in six languages.

Save it for your blog, Howard.


It sticks, I'm sorry.

 Okay, thanks.
 You're welcome.

Oh, you're just gonna step right...? Okay.

 The hair products are Sheldon's.

Okay.

 Um, can I ask you a favor?
 A favor?

Sure, you could ask me a favor.
I would do you a favor for you.

 It's okay if you say no.
 Oh, I'll probably say yes.

It's just not the kind of thing
you ask a guy you just met.

Wow.

I really think we should examine
the chain of causality here.

 Must we?
 Event A:

A beautiful woman
stands naked in our shower.

Event B: We drive halfway across town
to retrieve a television set...

from the aforementioned woman's
ex-boyfriend.

Query: On what plane of existence
is there even a semi-rational link...

between these events?

She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.

Well, that may be the proximal cause
of our journey...

but we both know it exists
in contradistinction...

to the higher-level distal cause.

 Which is?
 You think with your penis.

That's a biological impossibility,
and you didn't have to come.

Oh, yes. I could have stayed behind
to watch Wolowitz hit on Penny...

in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.

And why can't she get her own TV?

Come on, you know how it is
with breakups.

No, I don't, and neither do you.

But I... I broke up with Joyce Kim.

You did not break up with Joyce Kim.
She defected to North Korea.

To mend her broken heart.

This situation is much less complicated.

There's some dispute
between Penny and her ex-boyfriend...

as to who gets custody of the TV.

 She just wanted to avoid a scene with him.
 So we get to have a scene with him?

No, Sheldon,
there's not going to be a scene.

There's two of us and one of him.

Leonard, the two of us
can't even carry a TV.

So you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon
at the university?

I'm sorry, do you speak English?

Oh, he speaks English.
He just can't speak to women.

Really? Why?

He's kind of a nerd.

Juice box?

 I'll do the talking.

 Hi. I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
 Hello.

What did I just...?

 We're here to pick up Penny's TV.
 Get lost.

Okay, thanks for your time.

 We're not gonna give up just like that.
 Leonard, the TV's in the building.

We've been denied access to the building,
ergo we are done.

Excuse me. If I were to give up at the first
hitch, I never would have identified...

the fingerprints of string theory
in the aftermath of the big bang.

My apologies. What's your plan?

It's just a privilege
to watch your mind at work.

Come on,
we have a combined IQ of 360.

We should be able to figure out
how to get into a stupid building.


 What do you think their combined IQ is?
 Just grab the door.

This is it.

I'll do the talking.

Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.

 Yeah?
 I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.

From the intercom.

How the hell did you get in the building?

We're scientists.

Tell him about our IQ.

 Leonard.
 What?

 My mom bought me those pants.
 I'm sorry.

You're gonna have to call her.

Sheldon, I am so sorry
I dragged you through this.

It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing
and it won't be my last.

And you were right about my motives.

I was hoping to establish
a relationship with Penny...

that might have someday led to sex.

Well, you got me out of my pants.

Anyway, I've learned my lesson.
She's out of my league, I'm done with her.

I've got my work.

One day I'll win the Nobel Prize
and then I'll die alone.

Don't think like that.
You're not going to die alone.

Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.

not gonna win a Nobel Prize.

This is one of my favorite places
to kick back after a quest.

They have a great house ale.

Wow, cool tiger.

Yeah, I've had him since Level 10.

His name is Buttons.

Anyway, if you had
your own game character...

we could hang out,
maybe go on a quest.

 That sounds interesting.
 So you'll think about it?

Oh, I don't think
I'll be able to stop thinking about it.

Smooth.

 We're home.
 Oh, my God. What happened?

Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards
and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.

I'm so sorry.

I really thought if you guys went
instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.

No, it was a valid hypothesis.

That was a valid hypo...?
What is happening to you?

Really, thank you so much
for going and trying.

You just... You're so terrific.

Why don't you put some clothes on,
I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?

 Really? Great.
 Thank you.

Okay.

You're not done with her, are you?

Our babies will be smart and beautiful.

Not to mention imaginary.

 Is Thai food okay with you, Penny?
 Sure.

We can't have Thai,
we had Indian for lunch.

 So?
 They're both curry-based cuisines.

 So?
 It would be gastronomically redundant.

I can see we're going to have to
spell out everything for this girl.

Any ideas, Raj?

Turn left on Lake Street
and head up to Colorado.

I know a wonderful little sushi bar
that has karaoke.

Oh, that sounds like fun.

Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me

Oh, baby, baby
Don't get hooked on me

I don't know your odds
in the world as a whole...

but as far as the population of this car
goes, you're a veritable mac daddy.

Baby, don't get hooked on me



The problem appears
to be unsolvable.

Maybe we could run
some computer simulations.

There are too many variables.
It would take forever.

We've got to be missing something.

Let's start again.

The movie is playing here
at 7:20, here at 7:40,

here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.

These theaters
have to be eliminated.

Why? They're state-of-the-art digital
projection, 20-channel surround sound.

Yes, but they have no Icee machines.

Despite my aggressive
letter-writing campaign, I might add.

What about the multiplex here?
The seats are terrific.

They have Twizzlers
instead of Red Vines.

No amount of lumbar support
can compensate for that.

It's gonna take
at least an hour to eat,

and I don't see
a Sheldon-approved restaurant

proximate
to a Sheldon-approved theater.

 We could eat after the movie.
 Unacceptable.

The delay would result in tomorrow's
bowel movement occurring at work.

Hang on, hang on.
There's a 7-Eleven here.

We smuggle Slurpees,
which are essentially Icees,

in under our coats,

after having a pleasant meal
either here, here or here.

I don't see how we missed that.

Excuse me, in what universe
are Slurpees Icees?

That's how we missed it.

Sheldon, would you be prepared,
on a non-precedential basis,

to create an emergency ad hoc
Slurpee-Icee equivalency?

You know I can't do that.

I guess we only have one option.

I don't see any way around it.

 Bye, Sheldon.
 See ya.

They're right,
it was the only option.

Subtitles: sub-way.fr

Shut the door!

 Why?
 Just do it!

 Get inside and shut the door.
 Well, you didn't specify.

 Is Leonard around?
 He went to the movies without me.

It was the only option.

I'm sorry, I don't understand
which social situation this is.

Could you give me some guidance
as to how to proceed?

The building manager's showing
an apartment downstairs,

 and I haven't paid my rent.
 Oh, I see.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable
harboring a fugitive

from the 2311 North
Los Robles Corporation.

It's no big deal.
I'm just a little behind on my bills

because they cut back my hours
at the restaurant and my car broke down.

If you recall, I pointed out
the "check engine" light

to you several months ago.

The "check engine" light is fine.

It's still blinking away.

It's the stupid engine
that stopped working.

It cost me like $1,200 to fix it.

It occurs to me you could solve all
your problems by obtaining more money.

Yes, it occurs to me, too.

Hang on a moment.

Here. Take some.

Pay me back when you can.

 You got a lot of money in there.
 That's why it's guarded by snakes.

 Take some.
 Don't be silly.

I'm never silly.

 Here.
 No, I can't.

Don't you need money?

 Yeah, but...
 This is money I'm not using.

But what if you need it?

My expenses account for 46.9%
of my after-tax income.

The rest is divvied up between
a small savings account,

this deceptive container
of peanut brittle

and the hollowed-out buttocks
of a superhero action figure

who shall remain nameless
for his own protection.

Or her own protection.

 Take some.
 Really? I mean, are you sure?

I see no large upcoming expenditures

unless they develop
an affordable technology

to fuse my skeleton
with adamantium like Wolverine.

Are they working on that?

I sincerely hope so.

Well, thank you.

No, I can't.

Honey, I don't want things
to be weird between us.

Won't it also be weird
if I have to say hello to you

every morning on my way to work
and you're living in a refrigerator box

and washing your hair
with rain water?

 I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
 Of course you will.

It's impossible to pay me back
sooner than you can.

Assuming you subscribe to a linear
understanding of time and causality.

I'm regretting this already.

I've given the matter some thought,
and...

I think I'd be willing to be a house pet
to a race of super-intelligent aliens.

Interesting.

Ask me why.

Do I have to?

Of course. That's how
you move a conversation forward.

Why?

The learning opportunities
would be abundant.

Additionally, I like
having my belly scratched.

 Hey, Penny. How was work?
 Great.

I hope I'm a waitress at the
Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.

Was that sarcasm?

Was that sarcasm?

 Was that sar...
 Stop it!

 You appear to have a package here.
 Oh, thanks.

This must be the beret I ordered.

A couple of months ago.
It was back-ordered.

Did you know the beret is an example

of a piece of women's fashion
adapted from male military uniforms?

Another fascinating example
is the epaulet.

He's not lying.
He does find that fascinating.

Whatever. It's not like
I'm running up and down the streets

just buying myself berets.

I bought one a month ago,
and it was back-ordered.

 Look, it finally arrived, all right?
 All right.

Oh, my God, would you just
get off my case?!

 Weird.
 Good, that was an unusual interaction.

I wasn't sure.

 Did you guys have an argument?
 No.

You clearly did something
to aggravate her.

I'm at a loss.

If you like, you can review
my daily log of social interactions

and see if there's
a blunder I overlooked.

Here you go.

You owe me another two dollars.
The price of moo shu pork went up.

It's getting tougher and tougher
to be a bad Jew.

Here you go, Penny.
Shrimp with lobster sauce.

 Thank you. What's my share?
 Don't worry about it. It's my treat.

Really, how much?

Whatever. $10, $11.

Which is it, $10 or $11?

$14.50. But it's no biggie.

You'll get the next one.

What?

He was just wondering if he wore
skintight jeans and a tank top

if he'd get
his shrimp lo mein for free.

What are you saying?
That I'm using my body to get dinner?

That I'm some kind of Chinese
food prostitute?

Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?

Let me tell you something.
I pay my own way in this world, okay?

I don't rely on anybody!

What was that about?

He has a nervous bladder
when he's stressed out.

Kind of like a puppy.

Here, Leonard.
$10, $11, $12... $14.

It was $14.50, but it's okay.

Oh, good.
Dinner's here.

Yes, and I'm having some.
I'm having takeout food.

You're damn right it's okay. I've been
having leftovers at the restaurant

for like four days, and I wanted
something different. So sue me.

Forgive me, but that would be

the very definition
of a frivolous lawsuit.

I will pay you back as soon as I can.
You just have to give me more time.

 You lent her money?
 She need money.

You seem under pressure.

Did I not lend you a sufficient amount?
Because I can give you more.

You know, you would just
love that, wouldn't you?

You would just love to
open up your little snake can

and throw some money
at the girl who can't pay her bills.

 Where are you going?
 Going home,

where I won't be interrogated
like a criminal.

I forgot my fortune cookie.

In case either of you
have larceny in your heart,

you should know that I've moved
my money out of the snake can.

But if you're ever short, there's always
a couple of 50s in Green Lantern's ass.

 Hey.
 Hey.

A little mood lighting, huh?

When I didn't pay my bill,

the Department of Water and Power
thought I would enjoy the ambience.

Yeah, they're very considerate
that way.

I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent.
Then I had like $14 left over.

$14, huh?

Put it back in your pocket,
or I'll find some other place to put it.

Back in the pocket it goes.

You do understand

Sheldon really doesn't care
when he gets the money back.

It's actually
one of the few idiosyncrasies

that doesn't make you
want to... kill him.

Yeah, well, that's not really
my big problem.

So you're a little behind on your bills.
Everybody gets behind on their bills.

I know, it's just...
This wasn't the plan.

It wasn't supposed to go this way.

What was the plan?

Waitress for six months
and then become a movie star.

 Was there a plan B?
 TV star.

It's probably not as bad as you think.
Let's take a look.

Maybe we can find
some corners to cut.

Here's something.

If you don't have electricity,
then you probably don't need cable.

Just a suggestion.

$170 dollars for acting classes?

No, I can't give up my acting classes.
I'm a professional actress.

You've had an acting job
where you got paid?

That is not the definition
of professional.

Actually, it kind of...
Let's keep looking.

What's $1,800 to the Los Angeles County
Superior Court?

That's nothing.

Nothing?

It sounds like you got caught speeding
going 4,000 miles an hour.

Remember Kurt?

Your ex-boyfriend?

He got arrested for taking
a whiz on a cop car.

 What?
 He was drunk.

I would hope so.

He had a bunch of outstanding tickets
and a bench warrant,

so I, you know, I paid his fines.

 Did he pay you back?
 No, but he will.

And that's based on the inherent
credit-worthiness of people

who get drunk and urinate
on police vehicles?

Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt
and ask him for money.

 What are you gonna do?
 I don't know,

but I may have to find
a cheaper place to live.

You don't want to do that.

Why not?

Moving is a big deal.

You have to go to the supermarket
and get boxes,

and if they're not clean,
your books smell like melons,

and it's like...

Why don't you just get a roommate
and stay here?

Do you know anybody?

I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon
wouldn't mind moving in with you.

Leonard, honey,
if we started living together,

I wouldn't be able
to keep my hands off you.

Really?

And you thought my acting lessons
were a waste of money.

This Moo Shu pork's burning
a hole through my duodenum.

Leviticus 11:3:

"Only that which parteth the hoof
and cheweth the cud

among the beasts shall ye eat."

Do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita

every time you scarf down a Whopper?

 What's going on?
 We're on a quest

through the Valley of Fire
to acquire the sacred crown.

You want the Valley of Fire?
It's right here.

You guys want to go
on a real live quest?

Outside? I just made cocoa.

 Come on. It'll be fun.
 What is it?

Do you guys remember
Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?

Yeah, that's him.

Turns out he owes Penny a lot of money,
and I'm gonna go get it from him.

Who's with me?

Double sixes.

Really? You're just gonna
let me go by myself?

Cool, I got a sword.

I could use some help.

Here.

You guys are unbelievable.

You play a game
to simulate adventure,

but when there's real adventure
out there in the real world,

you just wimp out.

Do you not recall
the last time we visited this gentleman,

we returned home without pants?

 I do.
 Are you sure?

Because your proposal
suggests that you don't.

 I'm not afraid of him.
 All right.

Leonard fairly calls the question:

Who is in favor
of abandoning our game

and confronting Penny's
steroid-infused ex-boyfriend

in a suicidal mission
to extract money from him?

Say hi to Kurt for us.

Excuse me.

When Frodo left the Shire
to take the one ring to Mordor,

didn't Samwise, Pippin
and Merry go with him?

 They did.
 Well?

They had a terrible time of it.

Plus, no one stole their pants.

Fine.

Enjoy your little game.
I'll make this quest on my own.

Wait.

Take a jacket.
It's shpritzing a little.

You guys suck.

Come on, please? He's so big.

Is everyone clear on the plan?

Koothrappali's going to wet himself,

I'm gonna throw up,
Sheldon's gonna run away,

and you're going to die.

Shall we synchronize our watches?

Guys, there are four of us
and one of him.

Which means his triumph
will be even larger.

Minstrels will write songs
about him.

How about this? I'll do the talking.

You just stand behind me
and try to look formidable.

I should've peed before we left.

 Hi, Kurt.
 Lenny, right?

I don't really go by Lenny,
but that's okay.

You remember
Sheldon, Howard and Raj.

 What do you want?
 You don't remember me?

 How could he not rember me?
 Not now.

I remember him.

Here it is.

Penny's in kind of a financial jam,
and the money that you owe her

would go a long way
to solving her problems.

She sent you to get it from me?

No, no, she's too proud
to ask for the money.

I, on the other hand, feel
you should honor your debt.

You do?

"Feel" is a kind of a...
it's a strong word.

I just think it would be
a nice gesture on your part.

She'll get it when she gets it.

Well, there you go.
Problem solved.

A successful quest. Now let's go find
a gas station with a clean bathroom.

No, the problem isn't solved.

 He just blew us off.
 I've got it.

He didn't remember me
because the last time we met,

I was in a Halloween costume.

Come on, Leonard, let's go.

You can leave if you want to.
I'm gonna see this through.

I guess, technically,
that was my fault.

I'm not leaving here
without Penny's money.

What happened to your backup?

I don't need backup.

I have right on my side.

And I'm wearing cargo shorts
under my pants.

Congratulations.

You may not have succeed
in getting cash,

but you did secure
a formal acknowledgment of the debt.

Maybe we should have
your head notarized.

If anybody cares,
I still have to pee.

 Is Sheldon here?
 Hang on.

Nice hat.

It's kind of a fashionable look
these days.

Maybe if you're working
on a tuna boat.

 Hello, Penny.
 Sheldon, here is your money.

Thank you very much.
It helped a lot.

Sarcasm?

Darn. I can't seem
to get the hang of that.

I know it's none of my business,
but where did the money come from?

Well, I cut back my expenses
like you said

and picked up a few more hours
at the restaurant,

but the biggest thing was,
out of the blue, Kurt shows up

and gives me the money he owes me.

Really?

Did he say why?

He said he was feeling guilty
and wanted to do what was right.

That's it?

Did he give any reason
as to why he came

to this moral epiphany?

I just think he's really changed.

We're having dinner tomorrow night,
and I get to wear my new beret.

Bye, guys.

Well done, Leonard.

The true hero
doesn't seek adulation.

He fights for right and justice
simply because it's his nature.

Penny's hooking up
with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend,

and I have indelible ink
on my forehead!

That's your badge of honor...
your warrior's wound, if you will.

I was wrong.

Minstrels will write
songs about you.

Great.

There once was a brave lad
named Leonard

With a fi-fi fiddle dee-dee

He faced a fearsome giant

While Raj just wanted to pee



Previously on
The Big Bang Theory:

Guess who I found at LAX.
My baby sister Priya.

It's really nice
to see you again, Leonard.

Yeah, it's good
to see you, too.

Here you go.

Thanks.

You slept with
my sister?!

Yeah.

This is a terrible
betrayal of my trust!

Would it help
if I told you

that I offered
her my heart,

and she kinda
stomped on it?!

How hard did she stomp?

Very hard.

Okay, I'm good.

What's so funny?

Nothing. Just thinking

about the noises people
make during sex.

I do sometimes get a bit
carried away, don't I?

It's cute.

You sound a little
like a drunken monkey.

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

You know it's meant
as a compliment.

That's how I take it.

This is perfect.

I hope this moment
never ends.

Me, too.

Well, gotta go.
Oh!

Already?
Why don't you stay over?

I'd love to, but you know

my mother needs me in
the morning.

I think the woman can manage
to put a wig on by herself.

It's not just the wig.

It's pinning her hair up,
drawing on her eyebrows.

It's a two-person job.

It's just, when you leave right
after we make love,

it makes me feel...

cheap.

Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

What can I do?

Stay.

Okay.

Like, what, another five,
ten minutes?

Go home.

Your call.

Howard...

have you ever considered us
living together?

Boy, I don't know.

You, me, Ma living
under the same roof?

No, I mean just you and me.

You can move in here,

or we can find a place.

I've got a better solution.
What?

We wait for my mom's heart
to explode

from all the salt she eats.

Then we just stick her in
the ground, flip her mattress

and move into the big bedroom.

Great.

Look at us planning
a future together!

Who's there?!

Are you a
sex criminal?!

Sex criminals
don't have keys, Ma!

Where were you
so late?!

I was out with Bernadette!

I know what
that means!

I watch Dr. Phil!

I hope to God
you used a condom!

I'm not having this conversation
with you, Ma!

God forbid you get one of
those new fancy sex diseases!

Nobody has a disease!

I hope not!

I share a toilet
with you!

Is that what
you want?!

To give your
mother herbies?!

That's it!
I don't have to take this!

Good luck with your eyebrows in
the morning!

Who's there?!

Are you a
sex criminal?!

I'm still leaving!

I just forgot my Claritin!




Hey, what's up?

I need a place to crash.

Uh, sure.

Why?

Big fight with my mother.

Still arguing over
which CSI is the best?

No, we agreed they all have
their merits.

This was about Bernadette.

What's going on?

Howard's gonna sleep here
tonight.

He had a fight with his mother.

Did you offer him
a hot beverage?

No.

Leonard, social protocol states
when a friend is upset,

you offer them a hot beverage,
such as tea.

Tea does sound nice.

You heard the man, Leonard.

And while you're at it,
I'm upset

that we have an unannounced
houseguest, so make me cocoa.

Point of inquiry,

given that Leonard is
your secondary friend

and Koothrappali is
your primary friend,

why didn't you seek refuge
under his roof?

There's no room.

His sister is staying with him.

Wait, wait. What?

Cocoa, Leonard.
Focus.

I'm down in
the dumps here.

Priya's in town?

Yeah, some work thing.

Anyway, my mother seems
to think that Bernadette...

Hold on.
When did Priya get here?

I don't know.
A couple of days ago.

The thing is, Bernadette doesn't
like that I have to take care

of my mother, and my mother
doesn't trust Bernadette...

Yeah, that's a real pickle.

Bye.

Don't worry.

As your tertiary friend,

I am prepared to step in
and comfort you.

That's not really necessary.

No, no. I'll finish
making the tea,

while you narcissistically
ramble on

about whatever's troubling you.

Thanks.

That's what
tertiary friends are for.

Who is it?

It's Leonard.

You can't come in.

I just want to talk to her.

I forbid it.

Open the door,
Rajesh.

You heard me.

I forbidded it.

"Forbidded" it?

"Forbaded" it?

Get out of the way.

What are you doing here?

What are you doing here?

I have business in Los Angeles.

Why didn't you call?

Clearly, she was
sending you a message

to take a hike, Mike.

I'm sorry.
I thought about calling,

but I just wasn't sure if
seeing you was such a good idea.

I know. Last time
I came on too strong.

Can we talk in private?

No!
Sure.

It's completely inappropriate
for a single woman

to entertain a man in private.

If you insist on talking,
you must do it on the couch!

All right, you may talk in
the bedroom,

but I want this door
to remain open!

All right, just this once
you may close the door.

But keep in mind
I'll be right out here

monitoring the situation!

Oh, damn it.

Leonard, when you get this
message, call me.

Priya, this is your brother.

When you get this, tell Leonard
to check his voicemail.

Would you be sleeping over
again this evening?

Because you're welcome to.

That's very nice of you,
but I made other plans.

Well, just keep in mind that
should you ever need

a slightly apathetic tertiary
friend, I stand at the ready.

Hi, Howard.
Hi, Sheldon.

Hello.
Hey.

Why are you
holding hands?

I forbid you to hold hands.

Rajesh, you know Leonard and I
spent the night together.

Yeah, but you were just
sleeping,

because I forboded you
to have sex.

The word is "forbade""

You sure?
That doesn't sound right.

Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I
have decided

to see each other again,

and you don't get
to tell me

who I can and can't have
a relationship with.

Actually, he can.

The Hindu Code of Manu is
very clear in these matters.

If a woman's father is
not around,

the duty of controlling her base
desires falls

to the closest male member of
her family, in this case, Raj.

The code also states

that if she disobeys,
she will be reborn

"in the womb of a jackal
and tormented by diseases."

If true,

that seems
like an awfully large gamble

given that the prize is Leonard.

There it is, Priya.
We're Indian.

We believe this stuff.

I think it also says that
if you eat beef,

you need to live with cows
for three months

and drink their urine.

Some of it makes sense,
some of it's crazy.

My point is, you can't go out
with Leonard.

Who can't go out with Leonard?

My sister.

Penny, this is
Raj's sister, Priya.

It's very nice to meet you.

Oh, yeah, you, too.

Priya, if you're experiencing
any tension or awkwardness,

it may stem from the fact that
Leonard and Penny used to--

if I may quote Howard--
"do the dance with no pants."

Sheldon!

Really?

Hey, Bernadette, can I
talk to you for a second?

Sure.

Penny, you became disenchanted
with Leonard

as a lover.

Would you please tell
my sister why?

Listen, my mom's
going to Palm Springs

to visit her sister.

That's two whole nights
in a row I can sleep over

with you
all the way to morning.

Unless the desert air
dries out her sinuses,

in which case I'll have
to schlep out there

with the big humidifier.

That's it?

That's your big solution
to all of our problems?

If your mom's nose holds up,
we get two nights together?

Isn't that great?

No, it's not great.

You need to make a choice.

Me or your mother.

Uh...

Wrong answer.

No, wait.

You didn't let me finish.

I'm listening.

Uh...

I came as quickly as I could.

Okay.

Why?

To comfort you, of course.

Sheldon told me about Leonard
dating Rajesh's sister.

So I high-tailed it over here

to pick up the pieces
of your broken heart.

Amy, I'm fine.

You don't have to
be strong for me.

Now let's talk about Priya,
that man-stealing bitch.

What?

In situations like this,

best girlfriends are often
catty about the other woman.

Really, I am not upset
about Leonard and Priya.

Oh. Then perhaps you don't
understand what's going on.

Your former boyfriend
has replaced you

with what appears to be
a very suitable mate.

Arguably much
more suitable than you.

Oh. Well, good for him.

Hey, what do you mean,
"more suitable"?

Well, granted, Penny, your
secondary sexual characteristics

are reasonably bodacious.

But Priya is highly educated,

she's an accomplished
professional,

and she comes from the culture
that literally wrote the book

on neat ways to have sex.

Whereas you, on the other hand,
are a community college dropout

who comes from the culture that
wrote the book on tipping cows.

Yeah. Okay, I got it.

I got it.

So... what is
all that stuff?

This is a portable
electroencephalogram.

I'm doing research
on emotions and brain activity.

So when you start crying,

I can see which region
of the brain is activated.

Then I'm going to stimulate
the analogous area

in the brain of a rhesus monkey
and see if he cries.

Cool, huh?

I choose you.

Really?

Yep. I moved out
of my mother's house.

Cord is cut.

I'm all yours.

What did she say
when you told her?

I don't know. She hasn't
responded to my email yet.

This is so great.

I love you, Howard.

I love you, too.

So what's for dinner?

Well, I don't really have much
of anything in the house.

That's fine.

Why don't we go fool
around in our bedroom?

And then you
can go shopping.

I thought maybe after we eat,
we could see an early movie.

I'd love that.

I love the way you say,

"I'd love that."

She says it the same way I do.

"I'd love that."

Everybody in India
says it that way.

It's not a big deal.

Rajesh, don't be a child.

I'm not being a child.

Leonard, I swear to God,

if your sister
ever comes to town,

I shall have my way with her.

My sister's 38 and married.

All the more shame
that will fall

upon the house of Hofstadter.

Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.

That's remarkable.

If pepperoni
were an explosive substance,

you could replace
German shepherds

at our nation's airports.

Hi. Penny, right?

Oh, yes. H-Hi. I'm sorry.

I didn't know you had company.
I don't want to impose.

No, no. It's not
an imposition.

At this point, in our ecosystem,
you are akin to the plover,

a small scavenging bird
that eats extra food

from between
the teeth of crocodiles.

Please, fly into our open maw,
and have at it.

If I had more than a box of
baking soda in my refrigerator,

I wouldn't have to take that.

Hi, bestie.

Hi.

So, um, Priya,

you're a lawyer, right?

I know. Pretty boring, huh?

Oh, come on.
It's not boring at all.

She's currently helping set up
a secondary derivative market

which would allow
overseas car firms

to hedge their investments

against potential advancements
in battery technology.

Hmm?

Thank you, Leonard.

That doesn't make it
sound boring at all.

So, how you holding up?

I'm fine.

Oh, who are you kidding?
She's breathtaking.

So, Penny,

Leonard tells me
you're an actress.

That must be
pretty exciting.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's real great.

Today I drove to Van Nuys
for an audition

I thought was going to be
for a cat food commercial.

Turned out to be porn.

Did you get the part?

I didn't do the audition.

Given the state of your career,

can you really afford
to be picky?

I took acting classes
when I was at Cambridge.

I loved it.

We did Taming
of the Shrew.

Oh, wow. I love
Taming of the Shrew.

I did a paper
on it in high school.

"Who knows not where
a wasp does wear his sting?

In his tail."

"In his tongue""
"Whose tongue?"

"Yours, if you
talk of tails,

and so farewell."

"What, with my tongue
in your tail?"

I'm regretting
my earlier cattiness.

She is an
absolute delight.

Wow.

Wow, indeed.

I can't believe we're
finally living together.

Yeah.

You know what would make
this moment perfect?

What?

A little snack.
You got any string cheese?

No.

I-I might have some cheddar.

Not as good.

You can't make strings with it.

Remind me to put it
on your shopping list.

Okay.

You have
hypo-allergenic detergent?

No.

Better put it on the list.

If you wash my underwear
with regular soap,

I get little red bumps
on my tuchus.

Wait a second.

I'm doing your laundry?

Well, honey,
it's not gonna do itself.

Oh, before I forget,

tomorrow morning, you're
driving me to the dentist.

I have to take you?

You don't have to take me.
You get to take me.

Wait a minute.
Are you telling me

your mother usually takes you
to the dentist?

It's not weird.

There's lots of kids there
with their moms.

I can't believe this.

What? It's fun.

If I have no cavities,

afterwards,
we go out for a treat.

All right, Howard, let's get
something straight right now.

I'm not going
to be your mother.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Where did that come from?

Who's that?!

Is it a
sex criminal?!

Nobody wants to do
that to you, Ma!

Where were you?!

Didn't you read my email?!

You know I can't turn on
that ferkakta computer!

I left you some brisket
on the kitchen counter!

Thank you!

Remember
to floss after.

We have the dentist
in the morning!

Oh, hey.
What's up?

I just wanted to
check in on you.

Why?

It seems like the
appropriate thing to do

when one's best friend
finds herself replaced

by a smart, beautiful woman

with the smoldering sexuality
of a crouched Bengal tiger.

I already told you,
I'm okay with it.

I mean, if anything,
I'm quite pleased

that Leonard
has found someone

that makes him so happy.

It's okay, it's okay.

Thank you.

Now, let's get these
electrodes attached

and see what's going on in that
pretty little noggin of yours.

Okay.

I smell Chinese food.

It's actually Thai.

You're slipping.

Are Leonard and Priya here?

They went to Catalina
for the weekend.

Oh. Where's Raj?

At home, forbidding it.

How about Howard?

I'm given to understand

his mother grounded him
for running away.

Oh, okay.

Well, I guess it's just
the two of us, huh?

Actually, it's
the three of us.

AMY
What up, bestie?

Good news.

Thanks to you, I was able
to make a rhesus monkey cry

like a disgraced televangelist.

Great.

So, you feeling better?

Not really.

Sheldon, you have
a guest who's upset.

Right. I'll make tea.

 Sweetie, it's okay. I don't want tea.
 I'm sorry. It's not optional.



Oh, my God, I love this chicken.

Oh, you know what they say,
"The best things in life are free."

You're right. I eat your food a lot.
How about this?

You can raid my fridge
any time you want.

Oh, that's very kind of you.

Next time I have a hankering
to wash down a D-cell battery...

with a jar of old pickle juice,
I'll come a-knocking.

Hey, Raj, you didn't send your RSVP in.

I'm supposed to ask you
if you're bringing someone.

I'll let you know.

Could you make it soon?
There's a battle over seating.

In one corner, Bernadette's mom.
In the other three, mine.

Yeah, I hate wedding receptions.
I wish the bride and groom...

would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins.

Slip on the ring, disappear,
and everyone goes home.

Oh, you liked Professor Geyser's wedding.

They had a make-your-own-sundae bar.

Oh, that was a night to remember.

Do you know, on one trip,
I just had a bowl of nuts.

Anyway, you gotta let me know
if you have a plus-one.

If not, my mom's trying
to sneak in the doctor...

who sucked the fat out of her neck.

All right, uh, fine.

I'm coming and I'm bringing somebody.

Koothrappali plus one.

 Who are you bringing?
 Who are you bringing?

He's bringing me. Who are you bringing?

Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O'Donnells.

Come on, who is it?

I'm not telling. I'm from Asia.
I'm mysterious. Deal with it.

Howard, are you having
a make-your-own-sundae bar?

Uh, I don't think so.

Well, you should.
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce.

But 100 percent of make-your-own-sundae
bars end in happiness.


 Hello, Mommy, Daddy. How are you?
 Pretty good, can't complain.

Oh, I'm sure you can.
Just give it a minute.

Listen, uh...

There's something I want
to talk to you about.

I wasn't ready until now
but I think it's time.

It's finally happening.

You're coming out of the closet,
aren't you?

We love you
and we accept your alternate lifestyle.

Just keep it to yourself.

No, I'm not gay.

If anything, I'm metrosexual.

What's that?

It means I like women
as well as their skin-care products.

Well, if you're not coming out...

why did you call us
during the cricket semi-finals?

I'm tired of trying to meet someone...

and I think I'd like you
to help me find a...

A wife.

And just to clarify, a female wife?

Yes!

Matchmaking. Very smart move, son.

Much better than marrying for love.

We married for love.

And it's been wonderful.

Quantum physics makes me so happy.

Yeah? I'm glad.

It's like looking at the universe naked.



 Hi. Guys got a minute?
 Sure, what's up?

I was thinking about Sheldon's little joke
the other night...

 ...about me eating all your food.
 Oh, that was no joke.

But I understand your confusion
as I am our group's resident cutup.

I'm sorry, you are our resident cutup?

Yes.

 Prove it.
 Knock-knock.

 Who's there?
 Interrupting physicist.

 Interrupting phys...
 Muon. Ha, ha.

Anyway, I got a little residual check
from my commercial.

And I thought, "How about I get the guys
a little thank-you to pay them back?"

So, Sheldon... Ta-da.


A vintage, mint-in-box 1975
Mego Star Trek Transporter...

with real transporter action. Hot darn!

 Where did you get that?
 From Stuart at the comic-book store.

You went to the comic-book store
by yourself?

Yeah. It was fun.

I walked in and two different guys
got asthma attacks.

Felt pretty good.

Well, this calls for an expression
of gratitude.

Ooh, am I about to get
a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?

No, not this time.
Then they wouldn't be special.

Click. Thanks, Penny.

You're welcome.

Don't worry, I didn't forget about you.

Leonard, I got you a label-maker.

Wow.

No, it's great.

 Also, uh, mint-in-box.
 Mm.

 And I got you a Transporter too!
 Awesome!

Look, it was actually designed
for my vintage Mr. Spock action figure.

Oh, that's great.
Open it and put him in there.

 Open it?
 No, good Lord, no.

Why? They're just toys.

 Collectibles.
 They're mint-in-box.

Can't we open one up and take a look?

 Aah!
 No, don't!

Once you open the box, it loses its value.

Yeah, yeah. My mom gave me
the same lecture about my virginity.

Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun
taking it out and playing with it.

You sure you want us here
when you meet this woman?

Oh, yes. In my culture, it's expected to
have a chaperone to oversee a first date.

I want to make a good impression.
No offense, but with you here...

I look like I'm 6'2".

The nuns always chaperoned
the dances at my high school.

They used to make us leave room
between us for the Holy Spirit.

Hmm.

Hindus do the same thing.
Except they leave room for a cow. Ha, ha.

Listen, I love your charming
racist humor.

But any chance you could not mock
my religion while she's here?

 You made fun of me for eating lox.
 Your people don't worship lox.

Clearly you've never been to brunch
with my cousins.

So arranged marriages,
the parents just decide...

and then you get married?

Oh, no, no. I get a say in it. I'm sure
whoever shows up will be better company...

than the threesome I've been having
with Aunt Jemima and Mrs. Butterworth.

Excuse me, are you Rajesh?

Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi.

 Uh, nice to meet you.
 Nice to meet you too.

Oh, uh, these are my friends.
Uh, this is Bernadette.

 Hello.
 Uh, and this is Howard.

 You too.

Please, have a seat.

I'm thinking double wedding.

Dr. Cooper.

Dr. Cooper?

Is someone there?

Down here. On your desk.

 Spock?
 I need to speak with you.

Fascinating.

The only logical explanation
is that this is a dream.

It is not the only logical explanation.

For example,
you could be hallucinating...

after being hit on the head by,
say, a coconut.

Was I hit on the head by a coconut?

I am not going to dignify that
with a response.

Now to the matter at hand.

You need to play with the Transporter toy.

 But it's mint-in-box.
 Yes.

And to open it would destroy its value.

But remember, like me...

you also have a human half.

Well, I'm not going to dignify that
with a response.

Consider this.

 What is the purpose of a toy?
 To be played with.

Therefore, to not play with it would be...?

Illogical. Oh, damn it, Spock,
you're right.

I'll do it.

Sheldon, wait.

You have to wake up first.

Oh, of course.

Set phasers to "Dumb," right? Ha, ha.

Goodie, goodie, goodie.

This is wrong, this is wrong.
I'm so excited, but this is wrong.

I'm gonna do it.

I'm doing it.

I did it.


Oh.

That's what I always thought
1975 smelled like.

One to beam down, Mr. Scott.

Aye, aye, Mr. Spock.

Energize.

Aah.

Energize.

Don't be broken.

Oh. Please, don't be broken.

What did you make me do?

Okay, okay. Think.

It's only logical.

My goodness, that was delicious.

Well, I hope you saved room
for chocolate lava cake.

Impressive.

What goes into making something
like that?

Well, you start out by trying
to make chocolate soufflé.

And when it falls, you panic...

quickly change the name,
and voilà, lava cake.

I bet our parents are dying to know
how things are going here.

Well, let's see.

Yep, three missed calls.

Four missed calls, two text messages,
and a failed video chat.

 I win.
 Ha, ha.

So, what are we going to tell them?

 I'd like to tell them things are going well.
 Me too.

But before we get their hopes up...

we should probably make sure
we're on the same page.

Okay.

What page are you on?

I'm on the one where I'm under
a lot of pressure from my parents...

to get married and settle down
and have a family.

And I'm going to do it
so they don't find out I'm gay.

Say again?

I'm gay.

Like...

Dude-on-dude, but with women?

I know a fake marriage
isn't an honest way to live...

but you, of all people, should know
how difficult it is to come out.

Why me "of all people"?

Well, there's a rumor
back in New Delhi that you're...

How shall we say?

comfortable in a sari.

 I'm not gay.
 Really?

The chocolate lava cake,
the little soaps in the bathroom.

And I'm sorry, but you're wearing
more perfume than I am.

That's Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar.

And for your information, it's unisex.


 I like to boogie.
 Got you.

With women. I like to boogie with women.

That's disappointing. You were exactly
the kind of phony-baloney husband...

I was looking for.

Thank you.

And once again, my baloney likes girls.

Wait, wait. You don't wanna put
a bite of that in your mouth...

without trying
my homemade Chantilly cream.

Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.


Oh, dear.

Two suns and no sunscreen.

Hello again, Sheldon.

What is it now, Tiny Spock?

I am very disappointed in you.

You broke your toy
and switched it with Leonard's.

You should be ashamed of yourself.

You're the one who told me
to play with it.

If I told you to jump off the bridge
of the Enterprise, would you do it?

No.

If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise,
I would never ever leave.

Trust me, it gets old after a while.

You must right your wrong, Sheldon.

Why? I got away with it.

Leonard has his toy,
and he's never going to open it.

So he won't know it's broken.
And I have a toy that isn't broken.

Everybody's happy.

Well, I am unhappy.

I thought where you come from
they don't have emotions.

I come from a factory in Taiwan.

Now, do the right thing.

You know what you are?

Well, you're a green-blooded buzzkill.

Perhaps it's time you beam on
out of here.

Fine. I will just use the Transporter.

Oh, right, you broke it.

Very well. Cooper to Enterprise,
one to beam up.

Energize.



Aah! Tiny Spock! Help!

 Ready for lunch?
 Yeah, one sec. Ahh.

Oh, good. Ma would've killed me
if she found out I broke my retainer.

Hey, uh, can I run something by you?
It's about Lakshmi.

Yeah, sure. How are things going?

We hit a couple of bumps.

She lives over in Manhattan Beach,
so it takes like an hour to get there.

And she's a lesbian.

What do you mean, a lesbian?

Well, you know whenever you and I
would try to hit on women in bars...

they'd blow us off,
then we'd tell each other they were gay?

It's like that.

Except this time, it's true.

 Why did she even go out with you?
 She was looking for a husband...

so she can appear to be straight.

And, you know,
it sounded crazy to me at first...

but I'm actually thinking about doing it.

Okay. Well, so the reason that might
sound crazy is because it's crazy!

Look, Howard, you're in a relationship.

You know you have to make
compromises.

Yes, but my compromises
are about which bedspread to buy...

or whose turn it is to do the laundry,
Bernadette's or my mom's.

It's a great deal.
We both get our parents off our backs.

I don't have to come home
to an empty apartment.

Plus, once I'm married, I can finally eat
carbs again and let myself go.

Why don't you tell your parents
you wanna try to find someone else?

You know, one who hasn't slept
with more women than you.

Because this one wants to marry me.

I might never find another one who does.

You're thinking about marrying someone
you're never gonna have sex with?

I can't believe your attitude.

I thought you were in favor
of gay people getting married.

Yes, to other gay people.

Do you hear how homophobic you sound?


Oh, I don't want a broken toy.

Nothing.

 What?
 Nothing. I said nothing.

 That was weird.
 Really? I don't even notice anymore.

Ahh, I cannot believe you guys
aren't gonna play with these.

We told you, you don't. It's mint-in-box.

I don't know. I just think it's a waste.


Just relax, I'm just looking at the box.

You should look with your eyes and not
your muscular Nebraska man-hands.

What is your problem?

My problem is that I don't want you
to break Leonard's toy...

which you probably did by shaking it.
She shook it, we all saw her.

Leonard, I bought you this
because I wanted you to have fun with it.

I didn't want it to sit in this box.

You know what? You're right.

I mean, it's from you.
I'm never gonna sell it.

 I'm opening it.
 Yes.


 It's broken.
 What?

Oh, nice job, man-hands.

I didn't break it.

I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.

Yes. Yes, he did.

That is a perfectly satisfying
and plausible explana...

You know, let's all be mad at Stuart.

I paid a lot for this.
Let's take it over there and show him.

Absolutely.

Wait.

It was me.

I opened your toy...

discovered it was broken,
and didn't tell you.

 Why would you open mine?
 I didn't. That was a lie.

I opened my own toy...

and it was already broken,
so I switched them.

 Well, you should talk to Stuart.
 I can't, because that was a lie.

Yours was broken in an earthquake
and that's a lie.

What is the truth?

My Mr. Spock doll came to me
in a dream and forced me to open it.

And when the toy broke,
I switched it for yours.

Later, he encouraged me to do
the right thing and I defied him.

And then I was attacked by a Gorn.

 Okay, that I believe.
 Mm.

Leonard, Penny,
I want you both to know...

that I regret my actions
towards the two of you. That's a lie.

So is that one mine?

 Yes.
 Well, hand it over so I can open it.

Okay.

And, Leonard,
even though I don't have one anymore...

 ...I hope you have fun playing with it.
 That's a lie?

 A big, fat whopper.
 Yeah.

I hope it breaks.

This is a treat. What brings you guys by?

Raj, Howie told me what's going on
with you and Lakshmi.

 You told her?
 I told everybody.

We believe there's someone out there
who'll love you for you.

We kind of agreed to disagree
on that one.

But we both think
you shouldn't marry this woman.

So while I'm waiting
for this mysterious perfect match...

who may or may not exist,
I'm supposed to just be alone?

Not necessarily.

I think we found someone for you
to cuddle with.


Oh, my goodness.

Aren't you the cutest little Yorkie ever?

 You got him for me?
 Her.

We thought you two would hit it off.

I think we already have.
Thank you guys so much.

Let's go see if you fit in my man-purse.

Metrosexual, my ass.



Ooh, more details
about the new Star Trek film.

There's going to be a scene
depicting Spock's birth.

I'd be more interested in a scene
depicting Spock's conception.

Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating,
or, if you will, Pon farr...

 ...it's an extremely private matter.
 I'd like to know the details.

His mother was human. His father
was Vulcan. They couldn't conceive.

Maybe they had to go to a clinic.
Can you imagine Spock's dad...

with a copy of
Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears?

How come on Star Trek
everybody's private parts are the same?

No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk,
"Hey, get your thing out of my nose."


Hi. Can you help me?

I was writing an e-mail
and the A key got stuck.

Now it's just going, "Aaaah."

 What'd you spill on it?
 Nothing.

Diet Coke.

And yogurt.

And a little nail polish.

I'll take a look at it.

Gentlemen, switching
to local nerd news...

Fishman, Chen, Chaudury and McNair
aren't fielding a team...

in the Physics Bowl this year.

 You're kidding. Why not?
 They formed a barbershop quartet...

and got a gig playing
Knott's Berry Farm.

Wow. So in your world,
you're like the cool guys.

Recognize.

This is our year. With those guys out...

the entire Physics Bowl
will kneel before Zod.

 Zod?
 Kryptonian villain. Long story.

Good story.

 Count me out.
 What? Why?

You want me to use my intelligence
in a tawdry competition?

Would you ask Picasso
to play Pictionary?

Would you ask Noah Webster
to play Boggle?

Would you ask Jacques Cousteau
to play Go Fish?

Come on, you need a four-person team.
We're four people.

By that reasoning we should also
play bridge, hold up a huppah...

and enter the Olympic bobsled
competition.

Tickets to that, please.

Sheldon, what? Do I need to quote
Spock's dying words to you?

No, don't.

"The needs of the many..."

"Outweigh the needs of the few..."

"Or the one."

Damn it, I'll do it.

Okay, first order
of Physics Bowl business.

We need a truly kick-ass team name.
Suggestions?

How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?

It's beyond the laws of physics,
plus a little heads up for the ladies.

 The ladies?
 Perpetual Motion Squad...

we can go all night.

 I like it.
 I don't.

Teams are traditionally named after
fierce creatures...

thus intimidating one's opponent.

We could be the Bengal Tigers.

Poor choice. Gram for gram...

no animal exceeds the relative
fighting strength of the army ant.

Maybe so, but you can't incinerate
a Bengal tiger with a magnifying glass.

Let's put it to a vote.

 All those in favor...
 Point of order.

I move that any vote on team names
be unanimous.

No man should be forced to emblazon
his chest with a Bengal tiger...

when common sense dictates
it should be an army ant.

Will the gentleman from the great
state of denial yield for a question?

 I will yield.
 After we go through the exercise...

of an annoying series of votes,
which the gentleman will lose...

does he intend to quit
if he does not get his way?

 He does.
 We are the Army Ants. All those in favor?

Good afternoon and welcome
to today's Physics Bowl practice round.

I'm Penny,
and I'll be your host because...

I didn't have anything else
to do on a Saturday afternoon...

and isn't that just a little sad?

 Gentlemen, are you ready?

 It's none of my business...

but is a guy who can't speak
in front of women gonna hold you back?

Oh, he'll be okay once the women
are mixed into the crowd.

He only has a problem
when they're one-on-one and smell nice.

Oh, thanks, Raj. It's vanilla oil.

I was actually the one who noticed.
Okay, let's just start.

Okay, the first question
is on the topic of optics.

"What is the shortest light pulse
ever produced?"


 Dr. Cooper.
 Of course, the answer is 130 attoseconds.

 That is correct.
 I knew that too.

Good for you, sweetie.
Okay, next question.

"What is the quantum-mechanical effect
used to encode data on hard-disk drives?"


 Howard?
 The answer is giant magnetoresistance.

 Right.
 Hey, I buzzed in.

And I answered. It's called teamwork.

Don't you think I should answer
engineering questions? I am an engineer.

By that logic, I should answer anthropology
questions because I'm a mammal.

Just ask another one.

Okay.

"What artificial satellite has seen glimpses
of Einstein's predicted 'frame dragging'?"


And, of course, it's Gravity Probe B.

Sheldon, you have to let
somebody else answer.

 Why?
 Because it's polite.

What do manners have to do with it?
This is war.

Were the Romans polite
when they salted Carthage...

to make sure
nothing would ever grow again?

Leonard, you said
I only had to ask questions.

The objective is to give correct answers.

If I know them,
why shouldn't I give them?

Some of us might have
the correct answers too.

 Please. You don't even have a Ph.D.
 All right, that's it.

 Howard, sit down.
 Okay.

 We should take a little break.
 Good idea. I need my wrist brace.

All this button pushing is aggravating
my old Nintendo injury.


I agree.

What did he say?

He compared Sheldon to a disposable
feminine cleansing product...

one might use on a summer's eve.

Yeah, and the bag it came in.

Leonard, excellent.
I wanna show you something.

Can it wait? I need to talk to you.

Just look. I've designed
the perfect uniforms for our team.

The colors are based
on Star Trek: The Original Series.

The three of you will wear support red
and I will wear command gold.

Why do they say "AA"?

Army Ants.

Isn't that confusing? AA might mean
something else to certain people.

Why would a Physics Bowl team
be called Anodized Aluminum?

No, I meant...

Never mind.

Hey, check it out.

I got you a Batman cookie jar.

Oh, neat. What's the occasion?

Well, you're a friend
and you like Batman and cookies...

and you're off the team.

What?

Howard, Raj and I
just had a team meeting.

 You didn't.
 We did. I just came from there.

I don't know where you just came from.
It couldn't have been a team meeting.

I'm on the team and I wasn't there.
Ergo, the team did not meet.

Okay, let me try it this way.

I was at a coffee klatch
with a couple of friends...

and one thing led to another
and, it turns out, you're off the team.

 Why?
 Because you're taking all the fun out of it.

I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics Bowl
the team that has the most fun?

Okay. Let me try it this way.

You're annoying and no one wants
to play with you anymore.

I see.

Well, at this point I should inform you
that I intend to form my own team...

and destroy the molecular bonds
that bind your very matter together...

and reduce the resulting
particulate chaos to tears.

Thanks for the heads up.

You're welcome.

 One more thing.
 Yes?

It's on, bitch.

 So who did he get to be on his team?
 He won't say.

He just smiles
and eats macaroons out of his Bat-Jar.

He's using psychological warfare.
We must reply in kind.

I say we wait until he looks at us,
then laugh like:

"Yes, you are a smart
and strong competitor.

But we are also smart and strong...

and we have a reasonable chance
of defeating you."

How exactly would that laugh go?

Hee-hee-hee!

That sounds more like:

"We are a tall, thin woman who wants
to make a coat out of your dalmatians."

Guys, let's remember that Sheldon
is still our friend and my roommate.

So?

So nothing. Let's destroy him.

Gentlemen.

Hee-hee-hee!

Okay, we're gonna need a strong fourth
for our team.

You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played TV's Blossom.

She got a Ph.D. in neuroscience
or something.

Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom
to join our Physics Bowl team.

How about the girl from
The Wonder Years?

Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution
to all our problems.

We can't ask Leslie Winkle.

Why? Because you slept together...

and when she was done with you,
she discarded you like last night's chutney?

Yes.

 You gotta take one for the team.
 Yeah. Sack up, dude.

Fine.

Here I go, taking one for the team...

in the sack.

 Hey, Leslie.
 Hi, guys.

Ahem. So, Leslie,
I have a question for you...

and it might be a little awkward,
you know, given that I...

Hit that thing.

There's no reason to feel uncomfortable
because we've seen each other's faces...

and naked bodies contorted
in the sweet agony of coitus.

There's not? Gee, because it sure sounds
like there should be.

Any aspects of our sexual relationship,
regarding your preferences...

your idiosyncrasies, your performance,
are protected by the inherent...

 ...confidentiality of the bedroom.
 That's all very comforting...

but I'd like to get on my question now.

 Proceed.
 We are entering the Physics Bowl...

 ...and we need a fourth.
 No, thanks.

I'm really busy with my like-sign dilepton
supersymmetry search.

Dilepton shmylepton, we need you.

Sorry.

Well, we tried.

We'll just have to face Sheldon
mano y mano y mano a mano.

Wait, you're going up against
Sheldon Cooper?

 Yes.
 That arrogant, misogynistic...

doorknob that told me I should abandon
my work with high-energy particles...

for laundry and childbearing?

She's in.

So how do you feel?

Nice and loose? Come to play?
Got your game face on?

 Are you ready?

Yeah. You don't have to stay
for the whole thing.

Oh, no, no, I want to.
Sounds really interesting.

Okay.

 Gentlemen.
 Sheldon.

 Sheldon.
 Hee-hee-hee.

Sheldon.

I'm just gonna sit down.

So is that your team?

Actually, I don't need a team.

I could easily defeat you single-handedly,
but the rules require four.

So may I introduce the third-floor janitor,
the lady from the lunch room and...

My Spanish is not good.
either her son or her butcher.

And what about your team?

What rat have you recruited
to the S.S. Sinking Ship?

Hello, Sheldon.

Leslie Winkle.

Yeah, Leslie Winkle.
The answer to the question:

"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry
like a little girl?"

Yes, well, I'm polymerized tree sap,
and you're an inorganic adhesive.

So whatever verbal projectile you launch
in my direction is reflected off of me...

returns on its original trajectory,
and adheres to you.

Oh, ouch.

Okay, if everyone could please
take your seats?

Here's your T-shirt.

PMS?

It's a couple days early.

No.

It stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.

Oh, right, of course.
What was I thinking?

Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl.

Today's preliminary match
features two great teams:

AA versus PMS.

All night long, y'all.

Okay, well, let's jump right in.
First question.

For 10 points. "What is the isospin
singlet partner of the pi-zero meson?"


 PMS?
 The eta meson.

Correct.

 Formal protest.
 On what grounds?

The Velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt.

Denied. All right, for 10 points.

"What is the lightest element on Earth
with no stable isotope?"


 AA?
 And, of course, the answer is technetium.

Terrific.

Next question. "What is the force
between two uncharged plates...

due to quantum vacuum fluctuation?"


 PMS?
 And Sheldon can suck on...

 ...the Casimir effect.

"How does a quantum computer
factor large numbers?"


 PMS?
 Shor's algorithm.

Correct.

Four-point-one-eight-five-five times 10
to the seventh ergs per calorie.

Prévost's theory of exchanges.

Lambda equals one over pi-R-squared N.

Seven hundred and sixty degrees Celsius.

The approximate temperature
of the young lady in the front row.

Mr. Wolowitz,
this is your second warning.

A sigma particle.

Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the Earth.

Correct.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I hold in my hand the final question.

The score now stands,
AA, 1150, PMS, 1175.

So for 100 points and the match...

please turn your attention
to the formula on the screens.

Solve the equation.

Holy crap.

What the hell is that?

It looks like something they found
on the ship at Roswell.

 Come on, think. Leslie?
 It's not gonna work if you rush me.

 You have to let me get there.
 You are never gonna let that go, are you?

Ten seconds.


PMS?

Sorry, I panicked.

Then guess.

Um...

Eight.

Point four.

I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

AA, if you can answer correctly,
the match is yours.

He doesn't have it. He's got squat.

AA, I need your answer.


The answer is minus eight pi alpha.

Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.

 What are you doing?
 Answering question.

Winning Physics Bowl.

How do you know anything
about physics?

Here, I am janitor.
In former Soviet Union, I am physicist.

Leningrad Politechnika.

Go, Polar Bears.

That's a delightful little story.

Our arrangement was
you sit and not say anything.

 I answer the questions.
 You didn't answer question.

Hey, look. Now, maybe you have democracy
now in your beloved Russia...

but on this Physics Bowl team,
I rule with an iron fist.

Ow!

AA, I need your official answer.

 It's not what he said.
 Then what is it?

 I want a different question.
 You can't.

 Formal protest.
 Denied.

Informal protest.

Denied.

 I need your official answer.
 No, I decline to provide one.

That's too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct.

That's your opinion.

 All right, the winner of the match is...
 Hang on.

Sheldon, is proving you are single-handedly
smarter than everyone else so important...

that you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team?

I didn't understand the question.

 Go ahead.
 The winner is PMS.

Sorry, somebody's sitting there.

 Who?
 My Physics Bowl trophy.

That trophy is meaningless.
I forfeited, therefore you did not win.

 I know someone who would disagree.
 Who?

My Physics Bowl trophy.

"Leonard is so smart.

 Sheldon who?"
 All right, that is just very immature.

You're right. I'm sorry.

"I'm not!"

 Okay, new contest.

I am settling, once and for all,
who is the smartest around here.

 Okay? Are you ready?
 Absolutely.

 Bring it on.

"Marsha, Jan and Cindy were
the three daughters in what TV family?"

The Brady Bunch.

Okay.

"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth
as the lead singer in what group?"

The Brady Bunch?

Van Halen.

All right. "Madonna was married
to this Ridgemont High alum."

Oh, my God. Sean Penn.

How do you know these things?

I go outside and I talk to people.

Okay, here.
"What actor holds the record...

for being named People magazine's
Sexiest Man Alive?"

 William Shatner.
 Wait.

I don't think it's Shatner.

Then it's gotta be Patrick Stewart.

 No.
 Formal protest.

All right. "Singer who sang
'Oops!... I Did It Again'?"

Okay.

"Tweety bird thought he saw a what?"

Romulan.

Yes. He thought he saw a Romulan.




Gentlemen, I think I've come up
with a fun way...

to get young people
interested in science.

Physics Mad Libs.

Now, give me a number.

 Five.
 Uh-huh.

And an irrational constant.

E.

And a funny Greek letter.

 Gamma.
 I said funny.

 Upsilon?
 Heh, good one.

And an electrical charge.

 Positive.
 Ha, ha! Perfect.

Okay, get this. Ahem.

"Professor Jones
told the symposium...

he had a new method
for calculating the mass of a muon.

Five times the limit of, heh...

e to the upsilon as it approaches..."

Ha, ha, oh, my gosh. Okay.

Okay, no, no. Ahem.

I'll start over.

"Professor Jo..."


I haven't seen him laugh that hard...

since the day Leonard
made that multiplication error.

Oh, Lord, that multiplication error.

He thought he carried the one,
but he didn't.


It's not funny.
That mistake got published.

Stop, I'm gonna wet myself.

Guys. Guys, President Seibert
is headed this way.

 He doesn't look happy.

I'm guessing he wants Sheldon.

 Dr. Cooper.
 Told you.

Ah, President Seibert.

I assume you'd like to respond...

to one of the suggestions
I put in the box by your office.

No, and stop installing
suggestion boxes everywhere.

You don't like written suggestions.

You don't like when I give them
to you while in the men's room.

If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you're one of those people...

who are not open to suggestions.

Dr. Cooper, the Physics Department
tells me you're refusing to take vacation.

 I don't need a vacation.
 You're obligated to take one.

And I'd like you to know
the most often received suggestion...

in my suggestion box you installed
without asking me is:

"Can Dr. Cooper take a vacation?"

Okay, it's settled, then. I'll see you all
on Monday. Except for you.

But if I don't come into work,
what am I supposed to do?

Read, rest, travel.

I hear Afghanistan is nice
this time of year.

Sarcasm?

No, you should go.


Tonight's gonna be a good night

And tonight's gonna be a good night

And tonight's gonna be a good, good night

Tonight's the night, uh, uh
Let's live it up, uh

I got my money
Let's spend it up...

Good Lord.

Would you stop that caterwauling?


What the hell are you doing?

Bleeding from my ears.

 What are you doing hiding back there?
 I'm sneaking into work.

Now, if the guard at the university
asks what's under the blanket...

you tell him it's some lobster traps.

 Lobster traps?
 Yes.

That's how Velma and Scooby smuggled
Shaggy into the old lighthouse.

What are you gonna do
when you get to the university?

People are gonna recognize you.


Will they, Leonard?

Fine. Just get back under your blanket
and I'll drive you there.

And no more singing.

Fine.

I know you turned around.

I'm so glad you talked Howard...

out of having your wedding invitations
in Klingon.

Turn it over.

I'm hoping my relatives
think it's Hebrew.


This is really happening.

I'm gonna be a maid of honor.

'I'm gonna wear a beautiful dress
and walk down that aisle...

and finally,
I will have my special day.

You mean my special day.

They're gonna need an extra-large veil
for somebody's head.

 If I actually ever get married.
 Why wouldn't you?

My dad. Because I make
a lot more money than Howie...

he's putting a lot of pressure on me
to get a prenup.

 Ouch!
 Yeah.

 Howie's gonna freak out.
 Parental pressure can be daunting.

I remember the battle with my mother
about shaving my legs.

Last year, I finally gave in
and let her do it.

I just don't know
how I'm gonna break it to him.

I'm a believer in breaking bad news
to a guy when you're in bed.

That's how I told my high school
boyfriend I slept with his brother.

That's how I told his brother
the same thing.

I don't know.
I don't wanna manipulate him with sex.

Oh, sweetie, that's what sex is for.

The connection between marriage
and money is nothing new.

The term "wed" referred
to the money and livestock...

the groom paid the bride's father.

For example, you're adorable,
intelligent and a good earner.

I could conservatively see you going
for at least two oxen and a goose.

You would fetch a unicorn.

Sheldon, there are a million
great vacations you could take.

What about Hawaii?

Hawaii is a former leper colony
on top of an active volcano...

where the disappointing ending
to Lost was filmed.

Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.

How about Florida?

They got Cape Canaveral,
they got Disney.

They got my Aunt Ida and the world's
largest collection of diabetic candy.

And plus, if you get sweaty enough...

her plastic-covered furniture
is like a flume ride.

My family took a trip to Florida
when I was a child.

A seagull stole a hot dog from me
on the beach.

I got the message.

If I had a week off...

I'd go back to the Two Bunch Palms
Resort and Spa in the desert.

I tell you, an hour on the massage table
with Trevor...

and you'll feel like you were born
without bones.

I don't think I could ever let a guy
give me a massage.

Really? What was I doing to your neck
last night while you were playing Xbox?

Guys, I am living in a dictatorship.

You must have fun. You must enjoy life."

I don't think you have a good handle
on dictatorships.

Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.

to make Richard Feynman take a vacation.

But he chose instead to expand his mind
and learn something new.

He went to work
in his friend's biology lab.

Richard Feynman
was a famous American physicist...

part of the Manhattan Project.

Everyone in the world of science
knows who Richard Feynman was.

Yeah, now you do too.

Oh. I have a brilliant idea.
Amy's a biologist. I'll go work in her lab.

Isn't that just Feynman's idea?

Ten seconds ago you never heard
of him, now you're an expert.

 Hey.
 Hey, you.

That your laundry?
You have six things in there.

I didn't have any quarters.

So I've been sneaking stuff
into other people's loads all day.

If I tell you something,
you promise not to tell anybody?

Doesn't matter what I say,
you're gonna tell me anyway.

Wha...? That is not true.

Bernadette wants a prenup.

Wow.

That's rough.

If I became a famous movie star
and we got married...

 ...you wouldn't sign a prenup?
 Heh, absolutely not.

If I'm gonna be at home
with the kids...

while you're on location
cheating on me with Ryan Gosling...

then Leonard gots to get paid.

So do you think about us
getting married?

I think about a lot of things.

I think about us getting married,
about us breaking up.

Once in a while, I think about how I didn't
leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged...

but then I have a glass of wine
and it passes.

Joke all you want,
but you think about it.

Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do
get married, no Klingon invitations.

Good luck catching a man
with that attitude.

Boy, oh, boy, this vacation
is off to a wonderful start.

The smell of formaldehyde.

The whir of the centrifuge.

The distant chatter of lab animals
being dispatched for dissection.

Mm, I can already feel my cares
just melting away.

I'm excited to work with my boyfriend.
It's romantic.

Way to kill the mood.

Come on, Sheldon. We can be like
Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre...

who spent their days
working side by side...

bathed in the glow of their love
and the radium that ultimately killed her.

Screw Beauty and the Beast,
that's the love story Disney should tell.

Okay. What do we start with?

Maybe, uh, splicing some genes.
Clone a sheep.

Perhaps, uh, grow a human ear
on a mouse's back?

"Ha, ha! I'm a freak."

Well, I'm gonna be doing
some brain stem histology...

while you put yourself
on the business end of a sponge...

and wash those beakers.

Wash those b... Oh, I get it.

Little hazing for the new fellow. Yeah.
Better keep an eye out for, what...

shoe polish on the microscope...

or mad cow disease
in my grilled cheese sandwich?

No, I just need those beakers washed.
Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.

Excuse me, you have
Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab.

You're gonna make him
do the dishes?

That's like asking the incredible Hulk
to open a pickle jar.

Sheldon, you've never worked in a lab
like this before.

You have no experience
in the field of biology.

I have plenty of experience in biology.

I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998...

and it's still alive. Let's do this.

Where's Howard?

No, "Hi, Raj," no, "How are you, Raj?"

Just straight to,
"Where's the other white guy?"

I'm sorry.

So, listen, I heard something about him.
Can you keep it between us?

Ooh, gossip. When I first got here...

I thought Americans really gossiped
around the water cooler.

I hung out there for a month,
but the only gossip I heard...

was about some creepy guy
hanging out by the water cooler.

Bernadette wants to get a prenup.

Oh, that's a shame.
He's gonna be devastated.

I never know what to do
in these situations.

 Should I give him a heads up?
 Hmm.

I'm gonna give you the advice
I yell at the TV...

when the Bachelor
is handing out roses.

Follow your heart.

Check it out.

Look at the size of that
Rice Krispie Treat. Same price, ha, ha.

Ahem, hey, Howard,
I need to tell you something.

I know, it's not on my wedding diet.
I don't care.

No. Listen, I heard that Bernadette's thinking
about asking you for a prenup.

A prenup?

Heh, wow.

What are you gonna do?

I don't know.

Follow your heart.

You know what?
It's not a big deal.

I mean,
she makes more money than me.

She wants to protect
her financial interests.

 It's completely reasonable.
 Good, that's a healthy attitude.

Actually, it's good for both of us.
I have assets to protect too.

Like what?

Well, I've got some rare comic books.

You know,
the Vespa's almost paid off.

Ma and I have a primo
double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai...

right near the guy who played
Mr. Roper on Three's Company.

Mr. Roper's dead?

You can't just spring that on a guy.

Here you go.

This is now the only lab with glassware
washed by a man with two doctorates...

and a restraining order
signed by Carl Sagan.

Soap spots. Wash them again.

You're being ridiculous.
Those are perfectly clean.

This beaker used to contain
cerebrospinal fluid...

from an elephant
that died of syphilis.

If it's, in fact, perfectly clean,
drink from it.

Biologists are mean.

Perhaps this task
will be a little bit more up your alley.

I need you to count the bacteria spores
on these petri dishes.

There was something wrong
with that detergent.

 That was way too bubbly.
 I'm sure it was.

I intend to write that soap company
a strongly-worded letter.

Yeah, good for you.
Now start counting.

You know what this place needs?

A suggestion box.

Three hundred sixty-six.
Three hundred sixty-seven.

How's it going?

How's counting going?

When I was in kindergarten...

I recited pi to a thousand places
for the school talent show.

 I think I got this.
 Great.

Aw, nuts.

One.

This is preposterous.

You're giving me these tasks
because you're afraid...

if you give me anything meaningful
to do, I'll show you up.

Really? Is that what you think?

Yes, that's what I think.

And I'm super smart,
so it's probably true.

Hey, I've been training in the field
of neurobiology for 12 years.

You've been here three hours and
you spent one of them in the bathroom.

Well, I'm sorry, it takes me a while to get
things going on an unfamiliar toilet.

I've given you the simplest things to do
and you haven't done one of them right.

That's because
I'm not being challenged.

It's the same reason
Einstein failed math.

Maybe the math
was too bubbly for him.

You think you're doing science
by cutting up that brain?

They could do the same at Quiznos.

And they'd offer to toast it for me too.

Okay, smart guy.

I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus,
which is incredibly delicate work.

Have at it.

All right.

I'm no stranger to a little gray matter.


Locus coeruleus.

You're getting warmer.
It is indeed in the brain.

Hope your hands are steady.
It's the width of a single hair.

But this is just biology,
so it's no problem for a genius like you.

It's not. I will have you know
in the field of physics we work...

with particles so small they make
fat jokes about the locus coeruleus...

i.e., when your locus coeruleus
sits around the house...

it sits around the house.

Oh.

 Are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?
 No.

What you see
is a man trembling with confidence.

Does the locus coeruleus
normally bleed that much?

No, but your thumb does.

Oh, dear.

Yeah, you're a biologist.

What are you doing here?

I'm on vacation.

Social convention dictates that I let
my hair down at a local watering hole.

Social convention is stupid.

What happened to your thumb?

Yeah, I have ten fingers
and ten toes.

If I tell you a story about each of them,
we'll be here all day. Let's move on.

 What can I get you?
 Ah.

Seeing as I'm on vacation,
a piña colada seems appropriate.

Extra pineapple slices,
extra whipped cream...

extra cherries, extra umbrellas,
and, uh, hold the rum.

Don't let me have too many of those.

Hey. What are you guys doing here?

We're grown men.
We drink at bars, heh.

No and no.

Everything okay
with you and Bernadette?

Oh, yeah, sure.

 You and Amy? Good?
 Oh, better than good.

Those girls text me every detail
of their lives as it happens.

I'm not signing a prenup.

All right, Wolowitz, listen up. You
sign anything she puts in front of you.

You are the luckiest man alive.

If you let her go, there is no way
you can find anyone else.

Speaking on behalf of all women, it
is not gonna happen, we had a meeting.

And you.

A grown man fainting at the sight
of a little blood.

Excuse me,
this is a fairly substantial wound. You...


Amy. Amy.

Amy.

What do you want?

I was kind of hoping I could continue
vacationing in your laboratory.

After all, I did book the whole week.

Do you honestly think
you can just waltz back in here...

after the way you behaved
yesterday?

I was not myself.
I had lost a lot of thumb blood.

 That's not an apology.
 That is your opinion.

I want a real apology.

 I'm sorry that you weren't able to...
 No.

 That my genius got...
 No.

 That the soap was so...
 Sheldon.

Fine.

Sorry.

You're forgiven.

Now, if you wanna stay...

get started on those beakers.
They're still dirty from yesterday.

Next year, I'm going to Epcot.

Are you mad at me?

No. I'm not mad at you.

I just wish you would've come to me...

so I didn't have to hear it
through the nerd-vine.

So, what are we gonna do?

 You really want me to sign a prenup?
 I don't know.

My dad's pretty insistent on it,
though.

Why don't I talk to your dad?

 Man to man.
 Really?

 Oh, that'd be so great. Heh.
 Done.

I should probably give you a heads up
about a couple things.

Even though he's retired from
the police force, he still carries his gun.

But don't worry, he won't shoot it.
It's more of a fashion statement.

Okay, heh.

And just to be safe,
when you talk to him...

don't bring up Jimmy Carter,
gardeners...

foreign people, homosexuals,
Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control...

organic food,
the designated hitter rule...

recycling
or the fact that you're Jewish.

Got it, got it.
Will you e-mail me that list, heh?

So the thing to watch for,
if he's shouting at you, you're okay.

But if he starts to get real quiet...

leave as quickly as you can
without making eye contact.

Not in a straight line,
throw some zigs and zags in there.


You know, this isn't that pressing.

Why don't I talk to him about it
in May, heh?

In May you're gonna be on
the International Space Station.

They got a phone.



My new book The Hidden Reality
takes on a grand question:

Is our universe
the only universe?

You see, there's a growing
belief among scientists like me

that ours may only be one
among many universes

populating a gigantic cosmos.

In The Hidden Reality,
I explore this possibility

without presuming any knowledge
of mathematics or physics

on the part of the reader.

Hysterical.

I'm glad you
talked me into this.

We work so hard, sometimes,
it's nice to goof off

and do something silly.
Agreed.

Wait till you hear how he dumbs down
Werner Heisenberg for the crowd.

You may actually believe
you're in a comedy club.

You can think about Heisenberg's
"uncertainty principle"

much like the special order menu

that you find in certain Chinese
restaurants, where you have

dishes in column A
and other dishes in column B,

and if you order the first dish
in column A,

you can't order the
corresponding dish in column B.

That's sort of like the
"uncertainly principle."

 Ba-dum-bump. 

Say, I heard an
interesting tidbit

about Howard and
Bernadette.

Really, Amy? Gossip?

I'm disappointed in you.

Now, now.

Evolutionary biologist Robin
Dunbar has identified gossip

as an aid to social
bonding in large groups.

Forgive my language,
but "poppycock."

What if he's right?

And by not
participating in gossip,

society breaks
down into

small feral bands of tattooed
motorcycle riders

fighting to the death over the
last few cans of tuna fish?

Fine.

In the parlance
of the urban music scene,

"what's the 4-1-1"?

Bernadette is thinking about
breaking up with Howard.

I believe our nation's
tuna cans are safe.

Excuse me.
Dr. Greene, question?

Yes?

You've dedicated
your life's work

to educating
the general populace

about complex scientific ideas.

Yes, in part.

Have you ever considered

trying to do something useful?

Perhaps, reading to the elderly?

Excuse me?

Yeah, but not your books;
something they might enjoy.

I kid, of course. Big fan.




Nice shot.
Thank you.

My father taught me archery
as a child.

It's odd how the activity

brings back the smell
of Kmart bourbon.

Perfect.
I know.

What an elf
I would have made.

Whoo.

What do you think you're doing?

Shooting at a target?

With what?

An arrow.
Really?

I didn't see you draw one
from your quiver.

I'm not going to do that,
Sheldon.

Leonard, the people at Nintendo
can only go so far

in helping us recreate
an actual athletic experience.

We have to do our part, too.

That was uncalled for,
but...

I'll play along. Ow.

I had an unusual experience
with Amy last night.

Really? How could you tell?

She was attempting
to engage me in gossip.

Mm. You don't say.
Yes.

I think prolonged exposure
to Penny

has turned her into a bit
of a Gabby Gertie.

So, what's the gossip?

Oh, please, I was just
pointing it out.

I have no desire to engage
in the activity.

Fine, don't tell me.

All right, get this.

Bernadette is thinking
about breaking up with Howard.

Oh...

That's too bad.
I wonder what happened.

Mm, it's hard to say.
I can only speculate

based on the data I collected

watching my parents' marriage
implode.

In that case,
the woman dives into religion,

while the man dives
into a bottle-blonde bartender

who tries to buy my love
with action figures.

Oop! Out of arrows.

Boy, you sure get your money's
worth out of these games.

Priya, can I come in?
Sure.

Oh, God.

What?
It's okay.

You didn't know.
I'll take care of it.

What-what did I do?

Sheldon doesn't allow flossing

that close to the mirror.

You're kidding.

It's a splatter thing.

There's a little piece of tape
on the floor

you're supposed to stand behind.

That's madness.
I know.

Just do it. There's a big
inspection coming up,

and I don't want to lose
my TV privileges.

You really need
to let me take a look

at that roommate agreement,
one of these days.

Mm, I don't know.

I get a lawyer,
he gets a lawyer...

It's just easier
to stand behind the tape.

Oh, by the way,
a fellow at work

said I could use his
Dodger tickets this weekend.

Does that sound like fun?
Yeah!

Dodgers are baseball,
right?

You'll need to explain
the game to me.

Mm, it's complicated.

But as I remember it,
the essentials are

"get chosen last, get hit
by the ball, cry, go home."

Well, regardless,
I've got four tickets.

And I was thinking we can bring
Bernadette and Howard.

She's really interesting,
and I bet I can get used to him.

Well, it might not
be a great idea

to invite those two.
Why not?

Don't tell anybody
I told you,

but I heard she might
be breaking up with him.

Oh... too bad...

Although I do know one person
for whom that's good news.

Really? Who?

My brother.

He's got a big crush
on Bernadette.

What?

You're kidding.

No. I found poems
he wrote about her.

Very disturbing.

"Oh, Bernadette,
please play my clarinet."

Wow, that's hard to believe.
Yes.

And for years,
everyone in my family

was convinced that he was
the clarinet enthusiast.

Hmm. What's that
piece of tape?

Oh, that one doesn't
apply to you. You sit.

Hey.
Hey. How's it going?

Not too bad. Did you hear
about Howard and Bernadette?

'Course I heard about it.
How did you hear about it?

I heard about it
from Sheldon.

He got it from Amy.
Oh, damn it.

I told Amy that in the
strictest confidence.

Boy, some people are
such blabbermouths.

Well, whatever.

I'm sure Bernadette
can do better.

Do you think a sexually ambivalent
Indian astrophysicist

with selective mutism
and alcohol issues is better than

a hundred-pound Jewish guy
who lives with his mom?

You are kidding.
Raj likes Bernadette?

I didn't say Raj.
Who said Raj?

Okay, give.

How do you know?
Did he tell you?

No.
Well, then who?

I can't say...

Priya told you.
What a little gossip.

You know, not an attractive
quality in a woman, Leonard.

Not judging,
just my opinion.

Well, The point is,
if this got out,

it would destroy Howard
and Raj's friendship.

You don't have to worry.

Unlike Amy and Priya,
I know how to keep a secret.

You're the one who told Amy
in the first place.

In confidence!

Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.
How are you?

We're very rich
in a very poor country.

So, all in all,
can't complain.

So, Priya,

how are enjoying
staying with your brother?

It's fine. But if
I'm going to stay

in Los Angeles much longer,

I think I should
get my own place.

Why?

Is Rajesh not making you
feel comfortable?

Rajesh, why aren't you making
your sister comfortable?

I am making her comfortable.

Besides, she's not
sleeping here

half the time anyw...

What?

Where are you
sleeping, Priya?

It's a figure of
speech, Daddy.

It means I-I work late.

Please tell me
you're not dating an American.

I knew this would happen.

Rajesh, are you
letting your sister

date that little Howard boy?

Now, hold on. If she
is dating an American,

that's not a bad way to go.

He's Jewish.

Those chaps are
very successful,

and they don't drink a lot.

It-It doesn't matter.
Howard has a girlfriend.

For now.
What does that mean?

I'll tell you later.

Is something going on
with him and Bernadette?

Who's Bernadette?
Doesn't sound Jewish.

You can't tell by that.

Winona Ryder is Jewish.

Okay, we're getting
off the subject.

Rajesh, I want
you to try harder

to make your sister
feel welcome.

Thank you, Daddy.

Don't worry. Everything I have,
I share with her.

Including my friend Leon...

Good night, Mummy.
Good night, Daddy.

Oh, my God,
I think you broke my toe!

You should have kept
your mouth shut.

Fair enough.

Now, what's up with Clarinet...?
Bernadette!

I've been thinking about
Dr. Greene's efforts

to make science palatable
for the masses.

Oh, yeah? What about it?

That's all. I've just
been thinking about it.

Now, I'm thinking
about fractal equations.

Now I'm thinking about

the origin of the phrase
"train of thought."

Now I'm thinking about trains.

Are you listening
to this guy?

Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.

I was somewhere else.

Lucky bastard.

Now I'm thinking about Jell-O.

So what's up?

It's a Bernadette thing.

Oh, no. I hope
everything's okay.

Whatever it is,
we're here for you.

You can tell us anything.

Yeah. Good or
devastating.

I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

Marry you?
What?
Yeah.

I just need to figure out the
right time to pop the question.

Oh, I'd wait.
No rush, no rush.

Oh, great. It's my cousin David
about the ring.

Hey, David, what'd you find?

Sure, a half a caret's fine.

Her freakishly small hands
make anything look big.

It's one of the reasons
I love her.

Man, he's going
to be blindsided.

I know. It'll be awful.

Why are you smiling?

Yeah, Raj, why?

Uh, a smile means something
different in my country.

You know, tears of joy,
smile of sadness.

India's a goofy place.

Oh, I'm back to trains.

Woo-woo.

Did I tell you our lab got
a grant to study addiction?

No.
Fascinating work.

I recently trained a capuchin
monkey to smoke cigarettes.

Have you learned anything?

Yes. He looks much cooler
than the non-smoking monkeys.

Although it's not
much of a contest.

The other monkeys just
sit around and masturbate.

If you don't mind, I'd like to stop
listening to you and start talking.

By all means.

Howard has announced
his intention

to propose marriage
to Bernadette.

I don't understand.

The original piece of gossip
indicated an impending breakup.

I know.

The group consensus
is that his proposal

will be met with an humiliating,
soul-crushing rejection.

Everyone was set a-twitter.

Although oddly,
no one tweeted.

It's not surprising that
the story has captured

the attention of our
little circle of friends.

Are you familiar
with meme theory?

I'm familiar with
everything, but go on.

Meme theory suggests

that items of gossip
are like living things

that seek to reproduce
using humans as their host.

I'm no stranger to
memetic epidemiology.

At Johnson Elementary School,

the phrase "Shelly Cooper's
a smelly pooper" spread like wildfire.

I should think so.

That's gold.

Your meme hypothesis
does intrigue me.

How might we examine
this more closely?

Do you have any ethical qualms
regarding human experimentation?

It's one of the few forms of interaction
with people that I don't find repellent.

We need to fabricate a
tantalizing piece of gossip.

And a second non-tantalizing
piece to use as a control.

Then we'll track its progress
through our social group

and interpret the results through
the competing academic prisms

of memetic theory,
algebraic gossip and epidemiology.

Look at you, getting me to
engage in the social sciences.

You're a vixen,
Amy Farrah Fowler.

Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?

Sheldon and I engaged
in sexual intercourse.

In other news, I'm thinking of starting
an herb garden. Mum's the word. Gotta go.

Oh, hey, Raj, what
are you doing here?

I just felt like drinking alone,

because I'm deep and dark.

Uh-huh.

So, uh, Howard's not here?

No. It's just one of those
times when it's just you and me.

Like when the three of us
went to the movies,

and you and I waited outside
the bathroom

while Howard threw up
Red Vines and Cherry Coke.

Do you remember that?

Yeah.

Me, too.

Good times.

16 wants to order appetizers.

Oh, thanks.
This was nice.

What the hell are you doing?

Howard is your best friend,
and that is his girlfriend.

You should be
ashamed of yourself.

I was when I came in,

but it's amazing what
liquor does to guilt.

Besides what you
might not know

is Bernadette is planning on
breaking up with Howard.

Well, I know that. How do you know that?
My sister told me.

Oh, that gossipy bitch.

No offense.

None taken.

You should hear how
she talks about you.

Okay, listen, just because Howard
and Bernadette are having problems,

does not mean you should
be here sniffing around.

What can I do?

I can't stop
thinking about her.

All right, try
thinking about this--

Sheldon and Amy had sex.

Shut your ass!

Yeah, it's true.
Amy told me.

How did that even happen?

Did they know that's
what they were doing

when they were doing it?

I-I guess they just figured
it out at some point.

Wow.

I can't believe old
Smelly Pooper finally got laid.

Hey.
Hey.

Hope you're hungry.

Interesting.

A friendly sentiment
in this country,

cruel taunt in the Sudan.

It's a lesson in context.

Will Amy be
joining us for dinner?

Yes, I believe so.

Good, good.

Everything...
okay between you two?

Yes.

Why do you ask?

No reason.

I was just talking to Raj,

and he mentioned what a lovely
glow she has these days.

Did he mean
as if she'd been out in the sun,

tending an herb garden without
wearing a hat or sunblock?

No.

That's not what he meant.

Well, we may never know.

As my mother would say,

the Asians are
an inscrutable folk.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

Yeah, you do.
You dog, you.

Did you get that?

Every word.

Our false gossip meme appears
to have reached node lambda.

This is moving faster
than we thought.

Agreed.

It appears the rate

of gossip transmission

is proportional
to the number of nodes squared.

I must say, Amy,

pretending
to have intercourse with you

is giving me
a great deal of satisfaction.

Slow down, Sheldon.
I'm not quite there yet.

Pass the soy sauce.

Bernadette just asked about
my sexual encounter with you.

The meme has reached
full penetration.

Pun intended?

No. Happy accident.

This is remarkable.

Took less than 24 hours.

I should let you know

that she asked for details
about our dalliance.

Interesting.

So it went beyond the
mere fact of coitus

to a "blow by blow,"
as it were.

Pun intended?

I'm sorry. What pun?

Not important.

I described your lovemaking
as "aloof, but effective."

I wish you hadn't done that.

That's going to make
me a chick magnet,

and I'm so busy as it is.

Hey, everybody,

I got something I want
to ask Bernadette,

and I can't think
of a better time

than when I'm
with all my friends.

Oh, hold on, Howard.

There's lots of better times.

Leonard, please.
The man is talking.

Let him get it out, and let
the chips fall where they may.

Thank you.

Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski...

Oh, God.
What's happening?

I know things haven't
been perfect with us,

and we've had our problems,

but I just have to tell you,
from the moment I...

Howard, let me just
stop you right here.

This is it.

Yes.

Yes, what?

Yes, I will marry you.

You will?
You will?

I will.

I will!

Oh, I love you so much.

Oh, I love you, too.

Congratulations!

Oh, it's so exciting.

I wonder what
changed her mind.

Perhaps your talk
of my sexual prowess

renewed her faith in love.

As good an explanation as any.

That's great...

Oh, hey, Amy.

Bernadette just texted me.

Howard proposed?

Yes, not important.
Just stopped by

to let you know I'm
getting orthotics.

Also, I'm carrying
Sheldon's baby.

Mum's the word.

You're pregnant?!

Wow. Is there anything
on there about orthotics?



Aw, I always tear up when
the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.

Tears seem appropriate.

Enlargement of the heart muscle,
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy...

is a serious disease, which could lead
to congestive heart failure.

Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

 You really didn't like it, Sheldon?
 No, on the contrary.

I found the Grinch to be a relatable,
engaging character.

I was really with him up to the point that
he succumbed to social convention...

and returned the presents
and saved Christmas.

What a buzzkill that was.

When we watch Frosty the Snowman,
he roots for the sun.

Excuse me, but the sun is essential
for all life on Earth.

Frosty is merely a bit of frozen
supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat.

A crime, by the way, for which
he is never brought to account.

Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

I just love decorating the Christmas tree,
it makes me feel like a little girl again.

We didn't have a tree
when I was growing up.

 Really? Why not?
 Mm, in my family...

holidays weren't so much celebrated,
as studied for their anthropological...

and psychological implications
on human society.

Oh, sounds festive.
Did you at least give presents?

Hm, in a way. We presented papers.

And then broke off into focus groups
and critiqued each other.

Sheldon, what about you?
Did you have a tree?

Oh, yes.

We had a tree, we had a manger...

we had an inflatable Santa Claus
with plastic reindeer on the front lawn.

To make things more jolly, there were
so many blinking lights on the house...

they induced
neighborhood-wide seizures.

I take it you don't wanna
help us trim the tree?

I do not. But if you insist on decorating
a spider-infested fire hazard in my home...

I would request
that you that add this.

What is it?

You're kidding, right?
It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.

Oh, sure, sure.
Yeah, very Christmassy.

Excuse me, it's much more Christmassy
than anything you've put on the tree.

Here we go.

December 25th, 1642, Julian calendar,
Sir Isaac Newton is born.

Jesus, on the other hand,
was actually born in the summer.

His birthday was moved to coincide
with the traditional pagan holiday...

that celebrated the winter solstice
with lit fires and slaughtered goats.

Which, frankly, sounds like more fun...

than 12 hours of church
with my mother followed by a fruitcake.

Merry Newtonmas, everyone.

I sense that's not sincere,
although I have no idea why.

No, it's fine. Sir Isaac can go
next to this candy cane.

No, Isaac goes at the top of the tree.

 No, he doesn't.
 I understand.

You dispute Newton's claim
that he invented calculus...

and you want
to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.

Yeah, you got me. I'm a Leibniz man.

Perhaps when your mother gets here,
she'll talk some sense into you.

 What? Your mother's coming? When?
 Tomorrow.

When were you gonna tell me?

Oh. Tomorrow?

Why were you keeping this a secret?

 Well, I just... I thought...
 If I could interject here.

Obviously, Leonard is concerned that his
mother won't approve of you as his mate.

Wh...? Why wouldn't she approve of me?
I'm adorable.

 Yeah, you are. It's just my moth...
 If I could interject again.

Leonard comes from a remarkably
high-achieving family...

who have all chosen
high-achieving partners.

He probably feels that it's doubtful that
his mother will be overly impressed...

with his dating a woman
whose most significant achievement...

is memorizing
the Cheesecake Factory menu.

Hey, it's a big menu.

There's two pages just for desserts.

I know. And those specials,
they change every day.

Okay, it's lame when I say it,
it's ridiculous when you pile on.

Okay. Sorry.

What did she say
when you told her we were going out?

Um...

You didn't tell her we were going out,
did you?

Um...

 Why not?
 Um...

Leonard,
I'm no expert on meditation...

but if you're trying to calm yourself
down, I believe the word is "om."

It was so nice of you
to come to the airport to pick me up.

No trouble at all.

I drove, Mother.

I'm driving now.

Yes, dear. Mommy's proud.

Thank you for your notes on my paper
disproving quantum-brain-dynamic theory.

My pleasure.

You know, for a non-physicist,
you have a remarkable grasp...

of how electric dipoles
in the brain's water molecules...

could not possibly form
a Bose condensate.

Wait, wait, wait. When did you
send my mom notes on a paper?

August 16th.
Right after her carpal-tunnel surgery.

 Did I thank you for the flowers?
 You did.

 I don't really like flowers.
 Neither do I.

 But it's the social convention.
 It is, isn't it?

Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?

 Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.
 No, I heard that.

Then what was all that
"wait, wait, wait" about?

I just don't understand why
he knows more about your life than I do.

Because Sheldon and I stay in touch
due to mutual interest and respect...

while you avoid me
due to unresolved childhood issues.

It's what we think caused
your narcissistic-personality disorder.

We discussed it at length
during our last video chat.

Although how we got
onto the subject of you is baffling.

Yes, but we are on the subject,
so I'm obliged to ask.

Leonard, how are you?

 Fine, Mom. How are you?
 Menopausal.

Now I'm less fine.

 Have you heard your brother's engaged?
 No.

Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?

My bad.
I did send a gift from both of us.

She's a remarkable girl. The youngest
appeals-court judge in New Jersey...

and a two-time
Olympic bronze medalist.

You must be very happy.

Why? I'm not marrying her.

So how about you?
Are you seeing anyone interesting?

Well, I'm not sure
about interesting, but...

 Not the time, Sheldon.
 Very well.

Shall we switch topics
to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?

It's all right, Sheldon.

I will just pretend that Leonard's
not withholding information.

Although, I will point out, Leonard,
that I am a trained psychiatrist...

and you are exhibiting
the same secretive behavioral tics...

that accompanied
your learning to masturbate.

Isn't she brilliant, Leonard?

How I envy you.

So, Howard, have you and Rajesh
finally summoned the courage...

to express your latent
homosexual feelings towards one another?

What? No.

Why not?

Because we don't have latent
homosexual feelings toward one another.

I see.

 No, really. I have a girlfriend now.
 And where is she this evening?

She had to go out of town,
her grandmother died.

I see.

"Her grandmother died."

Honest to God. Ahem.
Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

What do you mean, you don't know
what I'm talking about?

 Tell her I have a girlfriend.
 All right.

He "has" a "girlfriend."

Her name is Bernadette.

She's a waitress, but going to school
to be a microbiologist.

The more passionately
you stick to this construct...

the more you're hurting
your partner.

Do you really think your lips in my ear
is helping?

 Hi. Sorry I'm late.
 Oh, glad you're here.

Sit down, I'll get you a plate.
Mom, you remember Penny?

Oh, yes, the waitress/actress
with the unresolved father issues.

Has he finally come to terms
with his little slugger growing breasts?

Well, he sent me a football
and a catcher's mitt for Christmas...

so I'm gonna say no.

If it helps,
we're all good with your breasts.

Classic overcompensation.

Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard,
that reminds me. I'm divorcing yours.

 What?
 Yes. He was cheating on me.

 No.
 Yes.

With some waitress
from the university cafeteria.

Can you believe it? A waitress.

Oh, no offense, dear.

No, it sounded like a compliment.

 When did this happen?
 Well, let's see.

Sheldon, when did I
leave Leonard's father?

September 22nd.

Right,
the weekend after Leonard's dog died.

Mitzy's dead?

She was old and blind, Leonard.
What choice did we have?

I don't believe this.
Why am I the last to know?

Excuse me,
I am the one getting a divorce...

Mitzy is the one who is dead,
why are you the one making a fuss?

You're right. I'm sorry.

I'm way out of line.

Penny, what's new in your life?

Nothing. Not a damn thing.

Thank you for driving me
back to my hotel.

Oh, it's not a problem.

I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but
he seemed a bit emotionally unstable...

and you don't want someone like that
operating heavy machinery.

No, you do not.

Your "check engine" light is on.

Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that.

So you must be devastated
about your divorce.

Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed
to be in a vehicle...

that's not subjected
to regular maintenance.

Come on, I mean, you're not upset
that your marriage is over?

Well, initially I felt something akin
to grief and perhaps anger...

but that's the natural reaction
of the limbic system...

to being betrayed
by a loathsome son of a bitch.

 Sure. Sure.
 Thankfully, my shock was mitigated...

by the fact that I haven't had
intercourse with him in eight years.

 Eight years?
 Oh, that's nothing.

I've been responsible
for my own orgasms since 1982.

Yikes.

Wha...? What's so funny?

That's exactly what I say
during orgasms: Yikes.

I could use a drink.
You wanna stop for a drink?

 Oh, I don't drink.
 I do. I'll teach you.

Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?

What is it?

I made tea.

I don't want tea.

I didn't make tea for you.

This is my tea.

Then why are you telling me?

It's a conversation starter.

That's a lousy conversation starter.

Oh, is it? We're conversing.
Checkmate.

What do you want, Sheldon?

What I want is to be departing
the starship Enterprise...

in a one-man shuttlecraft
headed to the planetoid I rule...

known as Sheldon Alpha Five.

Mm, I want that too.

Why are you here?

To comfort you, of course.

No, that's not going to work at all.
I'll comfort you from over here.

Leonard, what you're experiencing
is a classic Jungian crisis...

in which the aging individual
mourns the loss...

of the never-to-be-realized
ideal family unit.

 Thank you, that's very comforting.
 That's not the comforting part.

 It's not?
 No. No, the comforting part...

is that the Germans have a term
for what you're feeling, "Weltschmerz."

It means the depression that arises
from comparing the world as it is...

to a hypothetical idealized world.

You're right, I do feel better.

Yeah, the Germans have always been
a comforting people.

Just remember, Leonard, where
your biological family has failed you...

you always have me,
your surrogate family.

You're my surrogate family?

If it's any consolation,
I'm not happy about it either. Good night.

Okay, now this time,
try drinking it all at once.

Ah.

Yikes.

I've been responsible
for my own buzz since 2003.

Another round for me
and my homegirl.

I feel a spreading warmth
through my extremities.

As long as you don't feel it
running down your pants, you're fine.

That is fascinating.

I'm noticing an immediate
lowering of my inhibitions.

For example, I'm seriously considering
asking that busboy...

to ravish me in the alleyway
while I eat cheesecake.

What do you think?

Well, we are known
for our cheesecake.

 Hit us again.
 Yes.

 If a little is good, more must be better.
 Ha, ha.

 Hey, Bev, guess what?
 What?

I'm sleeping with your son.

Really?

Which one?

The one from whom
I live across the hall from.

Oh, well, that's convenient.
How did his penis turn out?

Oh, Beverly, I can't talk to
my boyfriend's mother about his penis.

Oh, fair enough.

What can you tell me, if anything,
about that busboy's penis?

Actually, I've only had the cheesecake.

One more time.

You know, Leonard did not wanna
tell you we were dating.

Really? That means he's either
embarrassed by the relationship...

or he doesn't care enough
about his mother to tell her he's in one.

Either way,
one of us should be insulted.

 Well, let's go find out who.
 You go get a taxi.

I'm gonna slip my business card
into that busboy's back pocket...

cupping his firm right buttock
as I do so.

 Leonard?
 Sonny boy.

Get out here!
Your mommy wants to talk to you!

What the hell is going on?

You're In trouble.

Why didn't you tell me
you were tapping my homegirl?

 Did I say that right?
 Yeah. Not bad, not bad.

Are you guys drunk?

Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would
we have stopped at Del Taco?

Now, how could you not tell me
you were in a relationship...

with this lovely,
charming young woman?

 Heh, heh. Thank you.
 You're welcome.

Is it because she's uneducated,
trapped in a menial service position?

What the hell happened
to lovely and charming?

How come you didn't tell me that you
and Father were getting a divorce?

How come you didn't tell me
you had surgery?

How come you didn't tell me
my dog died?

What I hear you saying...

is that you want a more intimate
mother-son relationship.

I do.

There. It's late. Now, go to bed.

I'm getting a warm feeling
spreading through my heart.

That's the Del Taco.

Why is Leonard softly banging his head
against his bedroom door?

Speaking of warm feelings...

Come here.

No, I'd rather have the busboy.

Thank you for taking me to the airport.

You're very welcome.

Once again, I'm driving.
I'm right here.

Please, I am very hung-over...

and in no mood
to satisfy your need for approval.

Sheldon, I do hope you forgive me
for my inappropriate behavior last night.

I don't blame you.

 You were intoxicated.
 Thank you.

I blame Penny.

I blame Penny too. Bad Penny.

Wait a minute, what are you talking
about? What inappropriate behavior?

 I think it's best that you not know.
 Agreed.

Agreed.

What the hell, agreed.

And I want you to take very good care
of this young woman.

 Aw. Thank you, Beverly.
 You're welcome.

She doesn't have much
in the way of career prospects.

Don't make her responsible
for her own orgasms as well.

Remember when I was complaining that
you don't communicate with me enough?

 Yes, dear.
 I'm over it.

Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.



Your argument is lacking
on all scientific merit.

And it is well established,
Superman cleans his uniform

by flying into Earth yellow Sun,
which incinerate any contaminate matter

and leaves the unvulnerable Kryptonian
fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

What if he gets something
Kryptonian on it?

 Like what?
 I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

I think we can safely assume
that all Kryptonian condiments

were destroyed
when the planet Krypton exploded.

Or it turned
into mustard Kryptonite,

the only way to destroy a rogue
Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.

Raj, please,
let's stay serious here.

Superman's body is Kryptonian,
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

What about Kryptonian pit stains?

Superman doesn't sweat
on Earth.

He's invited for dinner
in the Bottle City of Kandor.

He miniaturizes himself, enters the city
where he loses his superpowers.

Before dinner, his host says,

"Who's up for a little
Kryptonian tetherball?"

Superman says "Sure," works up a sweat,
comes back to Earth,

his uniform now stained with
indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.

Boo ya.

Superman would have
taken his uniform

to a Kandorian dry cleaner
before he left the Bottle.

"Kandorian dry cl..." I give up.

You can't have a rational
argument with this man.

Isn't that the guy who won
the MacArthur genius grant last year?

No, not all at once.

Then how?

Leonard.

Now, Raj.

Now, Sheldon.

I didn't get a good look.
Can I go again?

 It's David Underhill. So what?
 So what?

His observation of high-energy positrons
has provided

the first conclusive evidence for
the existence of galactic dark matter.

I have two words for you.
The first is "big," the other's "whoop."

It is a big whoop.

It made almost all the work
you've done completely useless.

 Did not.
 Did, too.

Okay, maybe some of it, but...

The guy was just in the right place,
at the right time

with the right paradigm-shifting
reinterpretation of the universe.

He got lucky.

In more ways than one.

He's a very handsome man.

Doesn't do anything for me.
If I was gonna go that way,

I'm more of a Zac Efron kinda guy.

Yeah, like you have
a shot with Zac Efron.

Excuse me...
Are you Leonard Hofstadter?

I'm David Underhill.

Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted
to set something up

in the photomultiplier lab,
that you'd be able to give me a hand?

 You want to work with me?
 If you have a little time.

Sure.

Yeah, no problem.

Here's my home number.
Here's my cell.

Here's my office.

Here's my parents' number
up in New Jersey.

They always know how to reach me.

Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant,
by the way. Big fan.

Thanks. I'll call you.

Bye-bye!

What are you looking at?
You've never seen a hypocrite before?

Subtitles: sub-way.fr

Trailing badly,
Wolowitz needs a strike

if he has any hopes of catching up
with Sheldon Cooper,

who is dominating in the ninth frame
with a career-best 68.

Hey, guys!

That doesn't count.
Do over! Do over!

There are no do-overs
in Wii bowling.

There are always do-overs
when my people play sports.

Where were you that's more important
than Wii bowling night?

 Actually...
 It's rhetorical.

There is nothing more important
than Wii bowling night.

Come on, it's just a video game.
And we suck at it.

Nice motivational speech
from the team captain.

 Where were you?
 I was working with Dave Underhill.

"Dave." Sounds like
Leonard's got a new BFF.

Actually, he's pretty cool.
Not only is he a brilliant scientist,

but it turns out
he's a Black Diamond skier.

He collects vintage motorcycles.
He plays in a rock band.

So? We're in a rock band.

No...

We play Rock Band
on our X-Box.

Nice motivational speech
from our lead guitarist.

He's funny, too.

He does this hysterical impersonation
of Stephen Hawking having phone sex.

What are you wearing?

That's not... He does it better.

He said he was gonna
take me to the gym tomorrow,

so I'm gonna go practice my situps.

Humongous man crush,
dude.

Yeah.
It's officially a bro-mance.

Are you and Leonard
putting up a Christmas tree?

No, because we don't celebrate

the ancient pagan festival
of Saturnalia.

 Saturnalia?
 Gather round, kids,

it's time for Sheldon's
beloved Christmas special.

In the pre-Christian era,

as the winter solstice
approached and the plants died,

pagans brought evergreen boughs
into their homes

as an act of sympathetic magic,

intended to guard the life essences
of the plants until spring.

This custom was later appropriated
by Northern Europeans

and eventually it becomes
the so-called Christmas tree.

And that, Charlie Brown,
is what boredom is all about.

Thank you for that,
but I got you and Leonard

a few silly neighbor gifts,
so I'll just put them under my tree.

Wait!
You bought me a present?

Why would you do such a thing?

'Cause it's Christmas?

I know you think
you're being generous,

but the foundation
of gift-giving is reciprocity.

You haven't given me a gift.
You've given me an obligation.

Don't feel bad, Penny,
it's a classic rookie mistake.

My first Hanukah with Sheldon,
he yelled at me for eight nights.

You don't have
to get me anything in return.

Of course I do.
The essence of the custom

is that I now have to go out and
purchase a gift of commensurate value

and representing the same
perceived level of friendship

as that represented
by the gift you've given me.

It's no wonder suicide rates
skyrocket this time of year.

Forget it.
I'm not giving you a present.

It's too late. I see it.
That elf sticker says, "To Sheldon."

The die has been cast.
The moving finger has writ,

Hannibal has crossed the Alps.

I know. It's funny
when it's not happening to us.

Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.

No, I brought this on myself

by being such an endearing
and important part of your life.

I'm going to need
a ride to the mall.

It's happening to us.

 Are you gonna make it?
 Yeah, I guess.

Thanks for letting me try out
your motorcycle.

No problem.

I had no idea it was so heavy.

The thing just fell right
over on me, didn't it?

Yeah.
Lucky for you it wasn't moving.

Hey, Leonard. Are you okay?

It's just a little
motorcycle accident.

My God, how fast were you going?

I don't know. It's all such a blur.

Good one.
He couldn't even get it started.

 Hi. Dave.
 Hi.

Penny.
So it's your motorcycle?

 Is it okay?
 It's fine.

Lucky for the bike
it landed on my leg.

You mind giving me a hand
with Speed Racer here?

 How do you know Leonard?
 I'm a physicist.

No, you're not.

Why is that so surprising?

Well, it's just that
the physicists I know

are indoorsy and pale.

I'm not indoorsy.
I just wear the appropriate sun block

because I don't take
melanoma lightly.

So, are you and Leonard
working on an experiment together?

 Actually we are.
 We're examining the radiation levels

of photomultiplier tubes
for a new dark matter detector.

Sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking.

You know, I love science.

 Since when?
 Since always.

Call me a geek, but I am just nuts

for the whole subatomic
particle thing.

The last thing I would
ever call you is a geek.

Well, that's what I am...
queen of the nerds.

If you like, I could show you
the lab we're working in.

We've got some cool toys,
you know, lasers and stuff.

You know, I have always wanted
to see a big science lab.

 Since when?
 Since always.

Leonard, are you okay here?

 I guess.
 How about we go see it now?

Maybe afterwards we take the bike,
we grab a little bite to eat...

Yeah, that sounds great.
Let me just get my jacket.

Boy, she'll do, huh?

Yeah, if you like that type.

So, you and her...?

 No, just neighbors.
 Really?

I don't know how you live
next door to that

without doing something about it.

Actually...

science is my lady.

 Okay. Let's go.
 All right.

 See you tomorrow, Leonard.
 See ya.

Have fun.

Did you forget your key?

I don't see anything in here
a woman would want.

You're kidding.

You've got lotions
and bath oils and soaps.

That's the estrogen hat trick.

What it is is a cacophonous assault

of eucalyptus, bayberry,
cinnamon and vanilla.

It's as if my head were trapped
in the pajamas of a sultan.

If you don't like this stuff,
let's go next door and build her a bear.

I told you before,
bears are terrifying.

Come on,

bath stuff. It's perfect!

You got a scented candle,
a cleansing buff,

spearmint and green tea scented
bath oil, promotes relaxation.

That presupposes Penny is tense.

She knows you. She's tense.
We all are. Buy a basket!

 Excuse me, we're ready.
 No, we're not.

Let's say for a moment that I accept
the bath item gift hypothesis,

I now lay the following
conundrum at your feet:

Which size?

This one. Let's go.

 You put no thought into that.
 I'm sorry.

This one. Let's go!

I have insufficient data to proceed.

Excuse me, miss?

If I were to give you
this gift basket,

based on that action alone
and no other data,

infer and describe
the hypothetical relationship

that exists between us.

Excuse me?

Here.

Now, are we friends?

Colleagues? Lovers?

Are you my grandmother?

I don't understand
what you're talking about

and you're making me
a little uncomfortable.

See? Sounds just like you and Penny.
We'll take it.

 Leonard. Come, join us.
 Hey, Dave.

And Penny, what a surprise.

Dave was just showing me
around the university.

This place is unbelievable!

I know, I've been offering to show
you around for a year and a half.

You always said you had yoga.

 I never said that.
 Maybe I heard you wrong.

A lot of words sound like "yoga."

This is an amazing woman.
She has a curious and agile mind,

not to mention being curious and agile
in other respects.

Shut up!

Yes, please shut up.

So... Dave,

don't you think you and I
should get back to the lab?

You know, that dark matter
isn't going to detect itself.

Actually, I was thinking about
taking the afternoon off

so I could work on another
experiment with Penny.

Really? We're going
to do an experiment?

We're going to explore
the effects of tequila shots

on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

It's not an experiment!
You saw what happened last night.

 You ready to go?
 Yeah.

 Can I drive the motorcycle?
 Yeah, why not?

You can't do any worse than Leonard.

That's funny.

By the way, my leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

Great news, Leonard.

I've solved my Penny gift dilemma.

Yippee.

You see, the danger was
that I might under or over-reciprocate,

but I have devised a foolproof plan.

See, I will open
her gift to me first

and then excuse myself,
feigning digestive distress.

Then...

I'll look up the price
of her gift online,

choose the basket
closest to that value,

give it to her

and then I'll return the others
for a full refund.

Brilliant.

It is, isn't it?

Is it okay if I hide them
in your room?

The smell makes me nauseated.

 Do whatever you want.
 Thank you, that's very gracious.

Gentlemen.

Why couldn't you have just done
what Leonard did

and get Penny a new boyfriend?

My leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

I have just one question for you.

While I am perfectly happy with the way
things are between us,

you said you didn't want
to go out with me

because I was too smart for you!

News flash, lady:

David Underhill is
ten times smarter than me!

You'd have to drive
a railroad spike into his brain

for me to beat him at checkers!

Next to him, I'm like one
of those sign-language gorillas

who knows how to ask for grapes!

So, my question is...

What's up with that?!

Why are you yelling at me?

Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Never mind, we're cool.

Dave is not smarter than you.
He's an idiot.

Really? Why would you say that?

Because a smart guy takes
the nude photos of his wife

off his cell phone
before he tries to take nude photos

of his girlfriend.

He tried to take nude photos of you?

That's what you took from that?!

The guy is married!

I'm so... Oh, that's terrible.

And you, if you are so okay
with the way things are between us,

why are you so jealous?

The important thing is
he's married and that's terrible!

Nice save, genius.

Eggnog?

Lactose.

It's just rum. It stopped being eggnog
like half an hour ago.

Smooth.

Smoother than you.

Come on, it's Christmas,
just give me this one.

Merry Christmas.

By the way, my leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

Merry Christmas.
How's your leg?

Very good, thanks for asking.
Come on in.

Good, Penny,
you're here to exchange gifts.

You'll be pleased to know I'm prepared
for whatever you have to offer.

Okay, here.

I should note I'm having
some digestive distress,

so, if I excuse myself abruptly,
don't be alarmed.

A napkin.

Turn it over.

"To Sheldon,

"live long and prosper.

"Leonard Nimoy."

He came into the restaurant.

Sorry the napkin's dirty.
He wiped his mouth with it.

I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!

Yeah, I guess.
But look, he signed it.

Do you realize what this means?!

All I need is a healthy ovum

and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!

All I'm giving you
is the napkin, Sheldon.

Be right back.

Here. Open it.

A gift cerficate
for motorcycle lessons.

 Very thoughtful.
 Yeah, and I checked.

Not letting the bike fall on you
while standing still

is lesson one.

Then, I think you'll appreciate
what I got you.

"101 Totally Cool Science
Experiments for Kids."

You know,
'cause you're so into science.

Sheldon! What did you do?!

I know!

It's not enough, is it?

Here.

Leonard, look!
Sheldon's hugging me.

It's a Saturnalia miracle.



Hey. So you guys ready
to order?

Since we come in
every Tuesday night at 6:00

and order the same exact thing,
and it's now 6:08,

I believe your question
not only answers itself

but also stands alongside
such other nonsensical queries

as "Who let the dogs out?"
and, uh, "How are they hanging""

Okay.

So, the usual, with extra spit
on Sheldon's hamburger.

Penny, a moment?

Do you have plans
this weekend?

Oh, gee, Amy, I'm sorry,

I'm actually pretty busy
this weekend.

Probably serving food
that was ordered today.

That's too bad. I was hoping
you could be my plus-one

at the Institute
of Interdisciplinary Studies'

symposium on the impact
of current scientific research

on societal interactions.

The what?

It's an annual
science conference.

We've all been invited to speak.

Oh! Oh, okay, well, you know,
like I said, I have plans, so...

Shame. Since you're
my best friend,

I thought it would be
a good bonding opportunity.

I'm your best friend?

Don't you read my blog?

Oh, don't feel bad.

I never read Leonard's, and
I used to sleep with him.

Do you know anybody else
who would appreciate

an all-expense-paid spa weekend

at a four-star resort
in Big Sur?

No, I really-- I'm sorry,
free what? Sorry, what, what?

I think her weekend
just opened up.

Wait, wait, just to be clear,
when you guys say "spa,"

does that mean the same thing
as when regular people say it?

Pretty much.

Except we keep
our shirts on in the sauna.

You know, it is going
to be difficult,

but I'm going to cancel my plans
so I can do this for my bestie.

Please don't touch my breasts.

I... I wasn't going to.

All right. I just want
to establish boundaries.

Boy, this is great. I haven't
had a vacation in ages.

In order to take a vacation,
one first has to work.

You know, for a smart guy,

you really seem to have a
hard time grasping the concept

"don't piss off the people
who handle the things you eat."

That does seem to be
a valid principle.

I trust Penny will adhere to

the "Official California
Restaurant Workers'

Solemn Oath of Ethics
and Cleanliness."

I don't believe
there's any such thing.

You lied to me?

 Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state 

 Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! 

 The Earth began to cool 

 The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools 

 We built the Wall 
 We built the pyramids 

 Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery 

 That all started
with a big bang 

 Bang! 



Good morning.

If I could have everyone's
attention, please?

I know we're all eager
to get on the road to Big Sur,

so if we focus, I'm sure we can
get through this orientation

in under a half an hour.

Then it's just Q&A,
quiz, safety drills,

pose for commemorative
group photo and we're off.

Don't worry. Just sit
next to me during the quiz,

and you can copy my answers.

Raj?

What are you doing?

I don't think so.

You've had your allotted
six ounces.

The first bathroom break
isn't until the Denny's

located near Bakersfield,

which is approximately
two and half hours away.

Remember, people, we're only as
strong as our weakest bladder.

Nobody cares about
your Kegel exercises.

All right. We have
seven people, and two cars.

In the lead car,
driven by Leonard,

will be... myself,

Amy Farrah Fowler,

and Penny.

Yes!

He had you in the other car,
but I got you upgraded.

Yay!

She made the case
that if we break down

in the middle of nowhere,
your Nebraska backwoods skills

and brawny hands
will give us the best chance

to survive in the wild.

Brawny?

They're bigger
than mine.

Red Leader to Red Five,
come in.

Red Leader to Red Five,
come in.

Howard, you promised.

WOLOWITZ
Fine. Red Five to Red Leader.

What do you want now?

It's 11:15. I'm requesting your
quarter-hourly location update.

Still right behind you.

Copy that, Red Five.

Radio contact is sufficient.

No need to extend
your middle finger.

So, Amy, I've
been wondering,

are you and Sheldon going
to be sharing a room?

No, we discussed it.

We decided we didn't want
to jeopardize our relationship

by getting to know
each other too well.

Indeed. Nothing sours
a friendship more

than over-familiarity
with someone's toilet routine.

I can vouch for that.

Hey.
Not you, him.

Oh. Thanks.

Although yours
was an eye-opener.

Don't worry, Penny.

You're my plus-one.
You'll bunk with me.

And FYI, travel
makes me constipated,

so I'm the ideal
hotel roommate.

Terrif.

Are we there yet?

I hope we get there in time
to see the keynote address.

Really? You want to see
the keynote?

Yeah, it sounds fun.

"Super bacteria:

global apocalypse or
exciting research opportunity?"

Actually, I was thinking we
could go straight to the room

and... take a nap.

Really?

And miss the keynote?

We can watch it later on C-SPAN.

Besides, I was really
looking forward to you and me...

napping together in the hotel.

Honey, if you're
that tired,

why don't you just take
a nap here in the car?

No, see, it's not...

Hang on.
It's Leonard.

Hi, Leonard.

LEONARD
Yeah, hi. Listen, I just
got a text from Raj.

He wanted me to tell you

that when Howard says "nap,"
he means "sex."

Thank you, Raj.

Are you... an element
in the actinoid series?

No.

Amy?

Are you usually radioactive
when found in nature?

No.

Are you in the
lanthanoid series?

Amy, it's Penny's turn.

Penny?

Uh, I don't know...

Are you food?

That's not apropos.

We've already established
I'm found in the periodic table.

Well, it's a table, right?

I mean, why can't there
be food on it?

I knew she wasn't
lead car materiel.

Who elected you
Road Trip God?

Leonard.

It was a late-night vote.

We were all exhausted,

and he was threatening
to filibuster.

It's not technically
"Road Trip God""

it's Travel Supervisor.

Although Road Trip God
does have a certain ring to it.

I don't understand
why you people

just let him bully
you like this.

Someone should
stand up to him.

What's he going to do?

I can't believe you let him
kick me out of the car.

What could we do?
He's the Travel Supervisor.

Don't worry, Penny.
This is a better car anyway.

Yeah. It's the Love Car.

Should I ask?

 They say we're young
and we don't know 

 We won't find out
until we grow 

 Well, I don't know
if all that's true 

 'Cause you got me,
and, baby, I got you 

 Babe 
 Mm da-da,
da-da, da-da 

 I got you, babe 

Red Leader, I'm really sorry.

 I got you, babe. 

WOLOWITZ AND BERNADETTE:
 I got you, babe... 

I missed you.

You know what?
I missed you, too.

Bernadette?

Oh, my God, Glenn!

Great to see you!

Are you here
for the conference?

Yeah, I'm doing
a global warming panel.

Oh, good for you.

Uh, Glenn,
this is my boyfriend Howard.

Nice to meet you.
Hi.

Ow. Hi.

You're a lucky man.

Bernie's
a great gal.

Yes. "Bernie" sure is.

Well, I got to run.
The panel's tomorrow morning.

It's called, "Remembering Snow:
A Look Back."

I'll try to catch it.

Oh, great.

Bye.
Bye.

Hey... Bernie?

Yeah?

Please tell me he's
your gay cousin.

No.

He was one of my professors
in college.

Oh! That's a relief.

Then we went out
for a year.

Come on, let's check in,
so we can take that nap.

No, it's not necessarily
proportional...

Shut up!

That green bag
is Dr. Cooper's.

Here's an extra five.
Make him wait.

Oh.

Right to the nap, huh? Okay?

Uh, so, this Glenn guy.

You say you went out with
him for, like, a year.

Do we really need to talk
about my old boyfriend now?

No. I guess not.

What is he, like,
six-four, six-five?

Six-seven.

Probably has a hard time
finding a suit that fits.

Is something
bothering you?

No. It's just...
What?

I'm just thinking.

If you had sex with that guy,

I mean, there's nothing
I can do here

that will make
any kind of... impact.

Howard, it's not a contest.

I love you.
I want to be with you.

Yeah, great, love you, too,
but...

If it were a contest,

I wouldn't have a chance, right?

You can't think
that way.

Yep.

Loser.

Howard, stop it.

Sorry. I just
never figured that

a guy like me going out
with a girl like you

would ever have to compete
with a guy like that.

Wait a minute, "a girl like me"?
What's that mean?

I'm... I...

Are you saying you
don't think I'm hot enough

to go out with a guy like Glenn?

No! No, I'm saying
exactly the opposite.

I'm too hot to go out
with a guy like Glenn?

Yeah, let's go with that.

Still nothing.

Remind me to try again
in an hour.

Will do.

So...

girl talk?

Um, sure.

What do you got in mind?

Do you subscribe to the Freudian
theory of penis envy?

Um, I never really
thought about it.

Why?

Sometimes I think it might be
nice to have one.

Really?

Not for sex, for convenience.

You can't deny that,
by comparison,

our internal plumbing
is extremely high maintenance.

Again, I've never given
it much thought.

We have time now.

Think about it.

Oh, good.

Hey.

Can I stay here tonight?

Yeah. Why, what happened?

Howard's a complete
and total ass.

Oh, yeah, that.
Come on in.

Thanks. I'll sleep
on the floor.

Not necessary.

Penny and I are perfectly
comfortable sharing a bed.

We are?

Of course, we're best friends.

Oh, right, right, the blog.

Word of warning, though.

I'm prone to night terrors,

so when I wake up kicking
and screaming, don't panic.

Just pin me down and stroke
my hair, and I'll be fine.

Hey, can I stay here tonight?
Shh-shh-shh.

Sheldon's asleep.

What's going on?

Well, Howard's a complete
and total ass,

Bernadette's in my bed,

and no matter how much you
stroke Amy's hair, she bites.

What?
Never mind.

Can I stay here or not?

Uh, sure.
All right.

So, how do you want
to do this?

Well, I'm not getting
in bed with him.

Yeah, it is
a little like

getting into
Dracula's coffin.

We're just gonna have
to make the best of this.

Okay, when you say
"make the best of it..."

Sleep.
Right.

So we'll just call
the middle here

the Neutral Zone.

The what?

Star Trek.

You know, the
Neutral Zone

between the Federation
and the Romulan Empire.

Oh, okay.

Just like old times.

Of course,

sometimes the Federation
and the Romulans

would enter
the Neutral Zone

to negotiate a
temporary truce.

Sweetie, let me put this
in a way you'll understand:

from the waist down,
my shields are up.

Got it, got it.

We can do all
kinds of stuff

from the waist up,
you know?

Go to sleep.
Good night.

Please tell me
you're not having coitus.

We are not having coitus.

Can you guarantee
that it won't happen

at any time during the night?

Yes.
No.

ANNOUNCER
Next on Turner Classic Movies,
Bridget Jones's Diary.

Oh, my God, I'm crying already.

Raj? Raj?

Raj?

I need to sleep
here tonight.

Why?

Howard is a complete
and total ass,

Bernadette is in Penny's
bed, Amy bites,

and Penny may or may not
have coitus with Leonard.

Okay. Come on in.

Leonard, are you asleep?

No.

I really appreciate you letting
me stay here tonight.

Sure, no problem.

I know it's kinda weird.

True dat.

"True dat"?

I've gotten a lot more street
since we broke up.

Right.

Still mad at me about that?

No. No, I understand.

I got too intense,
you had to back off.

Thank you.

I've gotten a lot better
at that, you know.

I've dated four different women
since we broke up

and I didn't tell any of them
that I loved them

and wanted
to have their babies.

Good for you.

Okay, good night.

Good night.

You know, maybe it wouldn't be
the worst idea in the world

to violate the Neutral Zone
for just one night.

Oh!

Hey, Leonard,
Sheldon kicked me

out of the room,
gave me your key.

Penny's here.

No, we don't want to watch
Bridget Jones's Diary!

Good morning and welcome
to Science and Society.

I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS,
MA, PhD, and ScD.

OMG, right?

Perhaps that joke was a little
too hippie-dippy for this crowd.

All right then, we'll begin
with opening remarks.

Miss Rostenkowski,
would you like to start us off

by discussing
your assessment

of science's responsibility
to society?

Sure.

I think all branches
of science

have to move cautiously
these days.

It's not just giant
nuclear weapons

that can destroy
the world.

As a microbiologist,
I can tell you

even the tiniest organisms
can still tear you a new one.

Interesting.

I think what you might need
to know about my colleague

is that though she claims
her field of interest  is tiny organisms,

she certainly has spent
her fair share of time

around what we can assume was
pretty massive weaponry.

I think Mr. Wolowitz
needs to keep in mind

that the past
is the past.

But he should know
that I am the kind of girl

who could get all
the giant missiles she wants.

Are we talking about women
wanting penises?

Because I'd like to weigh in.

Dr. Koothrappali, would you care
to join the conversation?

Certainly.
I'd like to raise two points.

Number one, I think they are
talking about penises.

And number two, these mimosas
are kicking my little brown ass.

I'd like to kick
your little brown ass.

What did I do?

Oh, I don't know.

Maybe when you walk
into a hotel room

and you see a guy getting back
together with his girlfriend,

you should consider doing
something other

than crawling into
the adjoining bed.

I did. You said no
Bridget Jones.

We weren't getting
back together!

It was a one-time thing!

Excuse me.

We're not taking comments
or questions

from the audience just yet.

Oh, shut up, Sheldon!

Hi, bestie.

All right,

why don't we see if we can bring
this back to topic.

Let me ask you
something, Bernie.

I guess not.

How would you feel if
you met my ex-girlfriend

and she was like
Angelina Jolie?

Oh, come on, Howard,
be realistic.

What, I'm not hot enough
for Angelina Jolie?

I'd like to weigh in here.

No.

All right,
why don't we open it up

to Q&A from the audience?

Yeah, I have a question.

Is there anybody who can get me
the hell out of here

and back to Los Angeles
tonight?

I'm driving back to L.A. tonight.

Penny, that's Glenn.
Glenn, that's Penny.

No!

SHELDON
Red Leader to Red Five.

Red Leader
to Red Five.

Anybody up for a little game?

I spy with my little eye...

a nonferrous metal.

Must be out of range.

Leonard, can I ask you
a question?

Sure.

Are you bothered by the fact
that your former girlfriend

left the symposium
with what is probably

the most beautiful man
I've ever seen in my life?

No. Why do you ask?

Because we're going
120 miles per hour.

All right, if no one's going
to guess...

I was spying the aluminum rims
on the police car

we passed a few miles back.



Yeah, I miss you too, sweetie. Ha, ha.

Okay, listen, I gotta go,
but I'll see you tonight.

Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye.

No, you hang up first.

Hello?

Dude, I'm glad
you finally got a girlfriend...

but do you have to do lovey-dovey
in front of us who don't?

Actually, he might have to.

There's an economic concept
known as a "positional good"...

in which an object is only valued
because it's not possessed by others.

The term was coined in 1976
by economist Fred Hirsch...

to replace the more colloquial
but less precise "neener-neener."

That's not true. My happiness
is not dependent on my best friend...

 ...being miserable and alone.
 Thank you.

I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a perk.

 Who's miserable and alone?
 Me.

Oh. I used to be like that.
Then I got a girlfriend.

In pre-1976 terms, "neener-neener."

What are you and Bernadette doing
for Valentine's Day?

Yeah, I'm pulling out all the stops.
There's a 39.95 Lover's Special...

at P.F. Chang's.

Yeah, egg rolls, dumplings,
bottomless wok.

Yeah, and you get your picture taken
on the big marble horse out front.

Given that Saint Valentine...

was a third century Roman priest
who was stoned and beheaded...

wouldn't a more appropriate
celebration...

be taking one's steady gal
to witness a brutal murder?

I understand your point,
but given the choice...

Jews always go with Chinese food.

If anyone's interested,
I'll be spending this Valentine's Day...

the same way
I spend every Valentine's.

Buying rotisserie chicken,
taking it home, standing over the sink...

and eating it out of the package
with my bare hands like an animal.

Okay, so to sum up,
one giant marble horse...

one asinine comment,
one lonely man and his chicken...

and let's see. Who's left?

Oh, that's right, my plans.

Isn't anyone gonna ask?

 You're gonna have sex with Penny.
 That's not what I was gonna tell you.

It's okay. I don't mind hearing
about your sex life.

It's his that bugs me.

Guess who the university
is sending to Switzerland...

to attend a conference and see the
CERN Super Collider on February 14th?

Professor Norton. God knows why.

He hasn't published anything of note
since he won that Nobel Prize.

Professor Norton can't make it.
He threw his back out climbing.

I heard he threw his back out
climbing on his girlfriend.

 Weathergirl on Channel Two?
 That's the one.

In any case,
they're asking me to fill in for him.

In Switzerland
or with the big-boobed weather girl?

Switzerland.
And I get to bring a guest.

 Oh, no way, dude!
 Oh, my God, this is incredible.

I'm so happy I'm not gonna question
their judgment in picking you.

I'm just gonna run home
and start packing.

Wait, why wouldn't you take Penny?

I am taking Penny.

Oh.

Then I anticipate an awkward situation
when you get home.

 Sheldon, you got a minute?
 Of course, my good friend. Come in.

Yeah, help me out.

Which ski hat says,
"Apr�s Super Collider"?

Sheldon,
I'm not taking you to Switzerland.

Well, of course you are.
Who else would you take?

 Penny.
 What? That's absurd.

Penny has no interest
in subatomic particle research.

Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day.

We can go sightseeing and skiing
and make love in front of a roaring fire...

in the shadow
of the snow-capped Alps.

But Penny has no interest
in subatomic particle research.

I'm sorry, Sheldon.

Sorry? I've been dreaming about
going to the Large Hadron Collider...

since I was 9 years old.

I've been dreaming about spending
Valentine's with a girl since I was 6.

Shame on you.

That's no dream for a scientist.

 Okay, what's the big surprise?
 Just a minute.

This tray contains clues...

as to what you and I are going
to be doing on Valentine's Day.

Oh, wow, okay. Let's see.

We've got milk chocolate,
Swiss cheese, fondue.

My lactose-intolerant boyfriend
is gonna eat all this...

then I'm gonna climb on his back
and rocket to the moon?

No.

But it does involve air travel.

Okay. Um...

Let me slice this Swiss cheese
with my Swiss Army knife...

and then you can wash it down...

with a cup
of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.

Okay, I'm starting to think
"Swiss" is key here.

Uh-huh.

We're going to Disneyland
and ride the Matterhorn.

How does that involve air travel?

We're going to Disney World
and ride the Matterhorn.

 No.
 Okay, sweetie, this started out fun...

but I'm over it.

We're going to Switzerland
to see the CERN Super Collider.

And ski. We'll also go skiing.

 We're going skiing in Switzerland?
 You'll ski, I'll fall.

But, yeah, we will be in Switzerland
for Valentine's Day.

 Oh, my God, Leonard, that's incredible.
 Ha-ha-ha.

Not so fast.

You might wanna hold off
on lighting your R��beliechtli, Penny.

My ribee-what-ly?

R��beliechtli, it means turnip light...

and refers to a lantern
hand-carved from a root vegetable...

to celebrate Swiss festivals
which you'll not be celebrating...

because, A,
these festivals occur in the fall...

and B,
you will not be going to Switzerland.

Sheldon, we've been through this.
I'm taking Penny.

Afraid not. Do you recognize this?

 Oh, not the roommate agreement.
 Indeed, the roommate agreement.

I call your attention
to the Friendship Rider...

in Appendix C: Future Commitments.
Number 37:

"In the event one friend is ever invited
to visit the Large Hadron Collider...

now under construction, he shall invite
the other friend to accompany him."

Oh, for God's sakes.

You actually put that
in an agreement?

We put in what happens
if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant...

or if one of us gets superpowers,
or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.

He can't kill me. Even if I turn.

Is there anything about
if one of you gets a girlfriend?

No, that seemed a little far-fetched.

Sheldon, do you really expect
to enforce this?

I've lived up to my commitments
under the agreement.

At least once a day I ask how you are,
even though I simply don't care.

I no longer stage spontaneous
biohazard drills after 10 p.m.

And I abandoned my goal
to master Tuvan throat singing.

 I shouldn't ask, but what is...?
 No.

I'd be much further along
if I'd been allowed to practice.

Look, Sheldon,
I know it's in the agreement.

If you turn into a zombie,
I promise I will not kill you.

In fact, I'll even let you eat my brains.
But I'm taking Penny to Switzerland.

 Is that your final decision?
 It is.

Very well.

It's not over, is it?

What do you think?

Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh?

Think it's gonna rain?

Instead of underpants, I covered
my crotch with potato salad. Thoughts?

I know what'll cheer you up.
Let's play one of your driving games.

All right. This game is called Traitors.

I will name three historical figures...

put them in order
of the heinousness of their betrayal:

Benedict Arnold, Judas,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

You really think I belong
with Benedict Arnold and Judas?

You're right. Judas had the decency
to hang himself after what he did.

Can't you at least try to understand
how much this means to me?

Round two: Leonard Hofstadter,
Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.

Rupert Murdoch?

He owns Fox
and they cancelled Firefly.

Hint: He and Darth Vader
are tied for number two.

Sorry, I couldn't hang with you.
I had a date with Bernadette.

I know. I saw the tweet.

 So, what did you end up doing?
 Not much. Nuked a burrito...

prayed to Hindu god Urvashi
your bowels'd loosen...

and your penis would droop
like a willow tree.

 You seen Sheldon?
 No.

 Is he still mad about the Super Collider?
 Yeah, he thinks I betrayed him.

What would you guys do
if you were me?

I'd take Sheldon to Switzerland.

 Seriously?
 Absolutely. And I'd leave him there.

What the hell is that?

Uh, let's see.

Yep, 30 pieces of silverware.

Morning, old chum.

 What's going on?
 I've made you breakfast.

Juice, coffee...

and pancakes in the shape of some
of your favorite fictional characters.

See, here's Frodo.

 You made Frodo pancakes?
 Yeah, I used coconut shavings...

to do the hair on his feet.

If you need to void your bladder
before eating...

I can keep them warm with this beret
that I thoroughly laundered...

and pressed into service
as a pancake cozy.

Why are you doing this?

It's by way of an apology
for my recent behavior.

I've had some time to reflect
and I've come to realize...

that friendship is not an aggregation
of written agreements.

It's the result of two people
respecting and caring for each other.

 Butterscotch scone?
 Thanks.

 It's good.
 What you're tasting is respect...

and affection.

And about a pound of Crisco.

After breakfast,
I thought we could spend the day...

watching the final season of Babylon 5
with director commentary.

You hate Babylon 5.

I do. It fails as drama, science fiction
and it's hopelessly derivative.

But you like it, and you're my friend.

Okay, great.

 Still not taking you to Switzerland.
 Drat.

No Frodo for you.

 Hello.
 Hello.

Let's dispense
with the friendly banter.

I believe you know why I'm here.

Well, I always figured
it was to study us...

discover our weaknesses,
and report back to your alien overlords.

Yes, amusing.

Extraordinary intelligence might well
appear extraterrestrial to you...

but let me be more specific.

I believe you know why I'm here
in the laundry room.

Better acoustics
for your throat singing?

It's actually not bad.

But my true purpose in being here
will be revealed...

in this brief PowerPoint presentation.
Ahem. Lights.

"Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD...

should go to Switzerland
to see the CERN Super Collider:

A PowerPoint presentation
by Sheldon Cooper, PhD."

Oh, for God's sakes.

Here, we have a highly gifted researcher
in the field of particle physics...

whose work has brought him
to the precipice...

of forever changing mankind's
understanding of the universe, a.k.a. me.

And here, we have a waitress
brushing her teeth with her finger.

A.k.a. you.

Sorry.
Is this supposed to be buttering me up?

Please hold all questions
until the end of the presentation.

This is the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN in Switzerland.

The product of decades
of planning and construction.

It is a mecca
for physicists the world over.

This is Bath and Body Works
on Colorado Boulevard.

They sell scented soaps and lotions.
Some of which contain glitter.

Now, let's see
if we can match the individual...

to the appropriate destination.

Okay. Show's over.

No, it's not. I've got five more slides.

Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision.

He invited me to Switzerland
and I intend to go.

Very well.

Enjoy yourself.

You're gonna be in the presence of
something I've dreamed of for decades.

I hope you'll appreciate...

the magnitude of where you are,
and what it represents.

I'll talk to Leonard.

 You will?
 Yes.

If it means that much to you,
you should go.

Oh, Penny, thank you.

 You're welcome.
 Since I rarely hug...

I'm relying on your expertise
regarding duration.

 I think we're there.
 Oh, good.

Bye-bye.

Even though I don't have a girlfriend, I
can still have a good time on Valentine's.

Trust me, you can't. I've tried.

No, no, no.
I'm gonna have a "me" day.

I'm gonna go
to one of those spas in Koreatown...

take a steam, get a massage.

Then I'm gonna stop at a pet store
and get licked by puppies.

 Sheldon, I need to talk to you.
 All right, my friend.

Would you like some cholermus?

 Some what?
 Cholermus.

It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish.

I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system
for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.

 You're not going to Switzerland.
 Oh, but I am.

Didn't Penny tell you the good news?

You went behind my back to guilt her
into letting you go instead of her.

Yes, that good news.

Forget it. I was the one invited,
I get to decide who goes with me.

And it's Penny, not you.

Howard, could you lower the lights?
I have a short PowerPoint presentation.

I don't need to see your presentation.
This discussion is over.

Well, that's a somewhat
ambiguous response. Am I going or not?

Sheldon, at this point...

I would go by myself
before I would take you.

 Really?
 Yeah, really.

Well, then.
You leave me no alternative.

From this moment forward,
we can be roommates...

but we will no longer be friends.

I'm sorry you feel that way.

I don't think you're fully aware
of the ramifications here, Leonard.

Why don't you enlighten me?

With the friendship clause
of our agreement nullified...

you're no longer entitled
to accompany me to go swimming...

at Bill Gates' house
should I be invited.

Ooh, that's gotta sting.

Think, this time tomorrow,
we'll be in Geneva, Switzerland...

 ...for our first Valentine's Day.
 I know.

I went shopping today and bought
special undies for the occasion.

Thermal? Because it's gonna be cold.

Think it through, Leonard.

 Oh.
 Oh.

Gesundheit.

Or as they say in Switzerland,
gesundheit.

 Getting a cold?
 No, no, it's probably just allergies.

You want an allergy pill?
I have them all.

Prescription, nonprescription, foreign,
domestic, experimental.

Do any of them work?

Not really, I'm just an enthusiast.

Penny?

You okay?

Did that sound okay to you?

Do not come in here.

What's going on?

I'm having a tea party.
What do you think is going on?

I think I might have the flu.

Or the plague.

Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m.
Do you think you'll feel better by then?

Yep. Because I'm gonna be dead.

Hey, Sheldon?

Listen, Penny's sick and she's not
gonna be able to go to Switzerland...

so if you're still interested,
you're welcome to come.

Great. I'll start packing.

In a minute.

Oh, look, it's the cholermus.

Ugh. Here's your soup.

 Chicken?
 Yes.

 With the little stars?
 Yes.

Heated to 180 degrees?

Why don't I pour it in your lap
and you can tell me?

You don't have to be mean. I'm sick.

 Yeah, well, I'm sick too.
 Not my problem.

I don't understand
how this happened to me.

I'm scrupulous about my hygiene,
I regularly disinfect my hands...

and I avoid contact with other people
on general principle.

I don't know what to tell you,
Sheldon.

Oh, Penny, thank you.

You're welcome.

It's you. I touched you.

Happy Valentine's Day.

Oh, my goodness, look at this room.

Champagne, roses,
oh, and little chocolates.

This is going to be
the best Valentine's Day ever.

Yeah, I forgot about all this.

But I never will.
