and cheese if he doesn't get to the point.

167
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,414
Okay, uh, here it is.

168
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,750
Is it cheating
if a guy has a girlfriend...?

169
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,585
Yeah, probably.

170
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,422
- Come on.
- I'm sorry, go ahead.

171
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,842
I met this girl and she's great.
We have a lot in common.

172
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,221
- Did you guys do it?
- No. We just made out a little.

173
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,099
Oh, look at you, you bad boy.

174
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,352
- Did you tell her about Priya?
- Uh, I was gonna...

175
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,522
...but there were too many tongues
in my mouth.

176
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,525
That's gross.

177
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,863
Here's the thing. Uh, I... I'm not one
of those guys who sneaks around...

178
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,865
...and sleeps with
more than one woman.

179
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,117
Well, good for you.

180
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,994
The problem is
I wanna be one of those guys.

181
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,748
So sleep with the new girl
and lie to Priya.

182
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,375
Oh, that's not who I am.

183
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,627
All right.
Then break it off with the new girl.

184
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,214
Now, let's not do anything rash.
She's really hot.

185
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,634
If you like this girl so much,
just end things with Priya.

186
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,012
Priya and I are in love.
I think we could get married someday.

187
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,099
You're looking for a way
to sleep with both women...

188
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,311
- ...and have everybody be happy about it.
- Now we're getting somewhere.

189

What does your gut tell you?

190
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,818
"Go ask Penny.
She'll know what to do."

I thought you were leaving
the apartment.

201
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,706
Yeah, me too.
I can't make up my mind.

202

Are you concerned because the world
is filled with big dogs and bullies?

203
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,715
No, I'm having a moral crisis.

204
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:26,638
Well, if it's of any help, I've read all
the great moral philosophers...

205
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,848
...including Dr. Seuss.

206
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,144
Oh, what the hell?

207
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,481
I'm supposed to go see that
girl from the comic book store, Alice.

208
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,735
But I don't know if I should, because I'm
going out with Priya, but she's in India.

209
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:45,573
All right.
So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity.

210
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,618
Probably won't be relying
on Seuss here.

211
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,830
Although One Fish Two Fish
Red Fish Blue Fish...

212
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,249
...might be surprisingly applicable.

213
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,503
- Go on.
- Well, uh, they say at the end of your life...

214
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,090
...you regret the stuff you didn't do
more than the stuff that you did.

215
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:06,386
And I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff
I wanna do.

216
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,266
You know, the German philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche...

217
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,769
...believed that morality
is just a fiction...

218
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,605
...used by the herd of inferior
human beings...

219
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,775
...to hold back the few superior men.

220
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,194
That actually does help.

00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,781

your fondness for orange juice?
