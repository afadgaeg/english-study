1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:07,329
Oh, damn. They cancelled my Visa.

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,165
Oh, yay, a new MasterCard.

3
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,671
Uh-oh.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,747
- What?
- I was going to get my mail.

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,349
Okay.

6
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,679
Are you hoping to get it telepathically?

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,321
I think you mean telekinetically.

8
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,322
And no.

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:32,028
Wasn't sure of the protocol now you
and Leonard are no longer having coitus.

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,223
Ugh.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,925
God, can we please just say
"no longer seeing each other"

12
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:37,730
Well, we could if it were true.

13
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,897
You live in the same building.
You see each other all the time.

14
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:44,066
The variable which has changed
is the coitus.

15
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,004
Okay, here's the protocol.

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,377
You and I are still friends,
and you stop saying coitus.

17
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,716
Good. I'm glad we're still friends.

18
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,354
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

19
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,956
It was a lot of work
to accommodate you in my life.

20
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,889
I'd hate for that effort
to have been in vain.

21
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,620
Right.

22
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:07,129
Just to be clear, do I have to stop
saying "coitus" with everyone or just you?

23
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,229
Everyone.

24
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,801
Harsh terms, but all right.

25
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:15,373
- I'll just substitute "intercourse."
- Great.

26
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,476
Or "fornication." Yeah...

27
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,909
But that has judgmental overtones,
so I'll hold that in reserve.

28
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,315
So how you been?

29
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,111
Well, my existence is a continuum...

30
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:31,053
...so I've been what I am at each point
in the implied time period.

31
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,923
You're just coitusing with me,
aren't you?

32
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,588
- Buzzinga.
- Mm.

33
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,330
- How's Leonard doing?
- He seems all right...

34
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,098
...although he does spend
a disturbing amount of time...

35
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,904
...looking at photographs of you
and smelling the pillow you slept on.

36
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,938
Although now that I think of it,
he asked me not to tell you that.

37
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,147
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

38
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,981
I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it.

39
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:07,587
I see you bought Mama Italia
marinara spaghetti sauce.

40
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,422
- Yep.
- That's the sauce my mother uses.

41
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,928
She likes cooking Italian...

42
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,626
...because, according to her,
that's what the Romans made Jesus eat.

43
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,202
Interesting. I'll have to have you over
for spaghetti some night.

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,771
I'm hungry now.

45
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,637
Oh, um, okay. Why don't you give me
an hour and come over?

46
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:31,113
Will you cut up hot dogs into little
chunks and mix them in with the sauce?

47
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,946
- I don't have hot dogs.
- It's all right. I do.

48
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:38,524
Oh. You're in for what my mother calls
a real Italian treat.

49
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,796
- Hey, where you been?
- I was talking with Penny.

50
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,229
What's wrong with you? You can't
hang out with your roommate's ex.

51
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,493
That's totally uncool.

52
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,163
No, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it.

53
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,309
Yeah. That's why he's been whining...

54
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:00,139
<i>...about trying to invent that
memory-wiper gizmo from Men In Black.</i>

55
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,314
Is he making any progress?

56
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,645
Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck
as Daredevil.

57
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,847
So would Ben Affleck.

58
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,151
The point is, in a situation like this,
you gotta pick sides.

59
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,523
You're either on team Leonard
or team Penny.

60
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,532
- Which one picks last?
- What?

61
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,829
Usually, I'm on the team
that picks last.

62
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,571
Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair.

63
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,568
Sheldon, I got you
your tangerine chicken.

64
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,543
I hope you're hungry.

65
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,540
Well, of course I'm hungry.

66
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,380
And as I have no plans
to eat with any other team...

67
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,921
...I will consume my tangerine chicken
with the appropriate gusto.

68
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,558
Mm, mm, mm.

69
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,086
Okay.

70
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,856
Just out of curiosity,
do we still have hot dogs?

71
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,794
I don't know. Why?

72
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,434
Just making dinner conversation.

73
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,537
Go team Leonard.

74
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,766
- Oh, God, this is good.
- Let me ask you a question.

75
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,836
Do you believe you're going to go to hell
for eating sweet-and-sour pork?

76
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,971
Jews don't have hell.
We have acid reflux.

77
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,838
Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?

78
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:44,342
Certainly. It's not like I have
to moderate my food intake...

79
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,850
...because I'm planning on eating again
very shortly.

80
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,954
Mm, mm, mm.

81
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,188
So you wanna do something tonight?

82
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,854
No, I can't. I gotta pick up my mom
from her water-aerobics class.

83
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,497
Eighteen overweight women
flapping their arm fat...

84
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,763
...in a swimming pool.

85
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,502
It's like the manatee tank
at SeaWorld.

86
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,304
- What about you, Raj?
- Oh, there it is.

87
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,542
Now you don't have a girlfriend
you wanna hang out with me again.

88
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,980
I never stopped hanging out with you.

89
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,714
I'm the friend you call
when you have no other options.

90
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,348
If we were the Justice League,
I'd be Aquaman.

91
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,556
I wish you were Aquaman.

92
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,822
Then I could send you to scoop my mom
out of the old-lady tank.

93
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,860
Excuse me, I'm thirsty...

94
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:41,872
...so I'm going to go to the refrigerator
and get myself a refreshing beverage.

95
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,376
You know what?
I'll just spend the evening alone.

96
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,344
What? Suddenly, I'm not good enough
for you?

97
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,554
I do so love beverages.

98
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,423
Now I think
I'll take my after-dinner walk.

99
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,234
Since when do you take
after-dinner walks?

100
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,371
Since when do you take walks?

101
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:17,406
I read a study online that walking
after a meal not only aids in digestion...

102
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,942
...but increases serotonin.

103
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:23,412
If there's one thing I like more than a
refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye.

104
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:28,888
- Hold on. I'll walk down with you.
- Oh, that's not necessary.

105
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,920
You can go first.

106
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,388
Or we could go together.

107
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,255
I can't think of a reason why not.

108
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,888
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

109
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,257
Nope. No reason.

110
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,742
I've missed you.

111
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,145
All right,
say hello to your mother for me.

112
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,749
Okay.

113
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,917
What?

114
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,786
You said you were going for a walk.

115
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,589
I didn't say outside.

116
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,633
So what, you're gonna walk
up and down the stairs?

117
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,600
No, of course not.

118
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,899
That would be odd
and suspicious behavior.

119
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,941
- Here, Rumples. Here, boy.
- Which way are you going?

120
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,603
- Which way are you going?
- I parked my scooter down the block.

121
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,977
I'm going the other way. Bye.

122
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,779
Bye.

123
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,149
Oh, actually, I'm this way.

124
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,291
Do I smell hot dogs?

125
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,519
No. I mean,
I have no idea what you smell.

126
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,688
Well, I definitely smell raw hot dog.

127
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,298
Perhaps you're getting a brain tumor.

128
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,793
All right, have a nice walk.

129
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,963
I shall. Have a nice scoot.

130
00:07:55,809 --> 00:08:00,303
You might wanna stand back.
I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.

131
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,654
Oh, hello, doggie. Nice doggie.

132
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,323
I bet you think you smell hot dogs.

133
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:21,991
Look, a cat.

134
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,004
Penny.

135
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,970
Penny.

136
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,341
Penny.

137
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,482
Here.

138
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,357
I had to trade the others for my life.

139
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,359
- Hey, Leonard?
- Yeah?

140
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,202
I haven't had sex in a year.

141
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,863
Where are you going with this, Raj?

142
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,866
Don't flatter yourself, dude.

143
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,939
- I wanna go out and meet a woman.
- So go.

144
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:13,051
I need a wingman. I don't wanna
come off like a lonely loser.

145
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,887
And you think my presence
will help with that?

146
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,720
Well, I do.
Next to you, I look like a catch.

147
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:25,121
- I'm not going out tonight, Raj.
- All right.

148
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,261
Would you mind if I went to your room
and downloaded Asian pornography?

149
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,234
Very much.

150
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,072
Doesn't have to be Asian.

151
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,071
- Don't worry. You'll meet a girl.
- No, I won't.

152
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,236
Yes, you will.
And she'll be beautiful...

153
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,077
...and kind and sexy and funny and
everything you ever wanted in a woman.

154
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,946
- You really think so?
- I do.

155
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,918
You'll fall hopelessly in love
and give her your heart.

156
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,582
She'll take it and grind it
into pathetic little pieces.

157
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,061
We will have sex first, right?

158
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,798
Mm, mm, mm.

159
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,105
That's Italian.

160
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,939
So was Leonard okay
with you coming over?

161
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,113
Oh. Yes.

162
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,651
In fact, he said, "I'm fine. I don't care."

163
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,483
In no manner
which would lead one to believe...

164
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,956
...that he was covering up feelings
of anguish and betrayal.

165
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,989
- Well, good.
- I'm also pleased to report...

166
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,997
...that he's all cried out over you.

167
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,627
He's been crying?

168
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,135
Oh, I believe that was something else
I wasn't supposed to mention.

169
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,502
Oh, God. I feel terrible.

170
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,700
Do you have a stomachache too?

171
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,345
No. Why, do you?

172
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,837
No.

173
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,809
Why did you ask if I had one too?

174
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,818
Just making polite
dinner conversation.

175
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,115
Your turn.

176
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,648
All right.

177
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,657
So, what's new in your life?

178
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:07,861
Well, my new shoes
are not made for running.

179
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,830
Have you been running?

180
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,398
No.

181
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,506
It's just a suspicion I have.

182
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,836
Mm, mm, mm.

183
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,342
- I'm so glad you like it.
- I do.

184
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,178
Leonard never cooks for me.

185
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,582
Well, maybe that's because
Leonard can't cook.

186
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,882
You can't cook and you made me this.

187
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,861
Whatever. Oh, let me get the cheesecake
out of the fridge.

188
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,189
Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.

189
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:51,542
Look at this. Do you think she's
really doing that or is it Photoshop?

190
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,178
I'm sure
Martha Stewart never got naked...

191
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,342
...with a room full
of big fat Japanese guys.

192
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,121
You don't know that.

193
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,517
Prison changes people.

194
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,853
Hey, where you been?

195
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,964
I told you. Walking.

196
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,963
For an hour and a half?

197
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,364
I got lost.

198
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,065
How could you get lost?
Your phone has GPS.

199
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,804
Satellites are down. Solar flares.

200
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,411
- There are no solar flares now.
- Yes, there are.

201
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,879
Dude, I'm an astrophysicist. If there
were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.

202
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,310
I'm sorry, I misspoke.

203
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,888
What I meant to say
was my battery died.

204
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,723
- What the hell was that about?
- I don't know.

205
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:46,092
Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton
doing it with Oprah?

206
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,594
Aw, we really need to get you a girl.

207
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,632
Leonard.

208
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,608
Leonard.

209
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,642
- Leonard.
- Oh, just come in!

210
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,812
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

211
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,513
What do you want, Sheldon?

212
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,250
Maybe this isn't a good time.

213
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:17,123
Tell me why you woke me up
or I swear to God I will kill you.

214
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,957
Do you really think death threats are an
appropriate way to begin conversation?

215
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,798
Sometimes your lack of social skills
astonishes me.

216
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,031
What do you want?

217
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,007
You may wanna sit down.

218
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,038
I'm in bed.

219
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,507
Point taken. You may wanna sit up.

220
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,209
Sheldon!

221
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,719
I've been seeing Penny
behind your back.

222
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,989
Okay.

223
00:13:55,635 --> 00:14:00,231
When you say "seeing Penny,"
what exactly does that mean?

224
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,468
We had dinner last night.

225
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,372
She made me spaghetti
with little hot dogs cut up in it.

226
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,172
Well, little hot dog.

227
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,510
I gave up the other five hot dogs
to a real dog.

228
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,583
A real big dog.

229
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,185
A hell hound.

230
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:18,484
It's tangential to the primary story.
How about I circle back to it?

231
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,561
Fine. Why did you
have dinner with Penny?

232
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,663
She made spaghetti
with little hot dogs.

233
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,026
I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.

234
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,161
Well, then why did you
have Chinese food with us?

235
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,065
I didn't wanna upset you.

236
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,867
Howard made it very clear that my
allegiance should be to male comrades...

237
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,738
...before women who sell their bodies
for money.

238
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,839
Is it possible he said,
"Bros before ho's"?

239
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,513
Yes, but I rephrased it
to avoid offending the ho's.

240
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:55,053
Sheldon, I don't care
if you wanna be friends with Penny.

241
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,792
Oh.

242
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,589
So the turmoil
that has been keeping me...

243
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,633
...from achieving REM sleep
was entirely unjustified?

244
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,728
Yes.

245
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,101
Well, then as my meemaw would say...

246
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:12,233
...looks like we butchered a pig,
but nobody wanted bacon.

247
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,541
I guess not.

248
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,208
And now, as promised, the tangent.

249
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,584
<i>Sheldon and the Hell Hound.</i>

250
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,588
<i>Or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.</i>

251
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,789
Oh, um, ahem.

252
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,830
- I can come back.
- Don't be silly.

253
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,832
We're neighbors. We're gonna run into
each other. May as well get used to it.

254
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,833
Yeah. I guess you're right.

255
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,470
- Used to it yet?
- Nope.

256
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,080
Me neither.

257
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,275
Oh. Sheldon seemed to think
I'd be upset about you hanging out.

258
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,183
But I want you to know it's fine.

259
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,256
Oh, good.
Because his mother called me.

260
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,821
- His mother?
- Yeah, she wants me...

261
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,259
...to take him shopping
for sheets and towels.

262
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,959
I was gonna do that.

263
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,466
Oh, well, then you do it.

264
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,502
I don't wanna do it. You can do it.

265
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,698
Okay, then you can take him
for shoes.

266
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,809
I just took him for shoes.

267
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,435
Well, all I know is he says
they hurt his feet.

268
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,641
Fine. I'll take him for shoes
next Saturday.

269
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,220
No. A bunch of us from work
are going to Disneyland next Saturday...

270
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,323
...and Sheldon wants to come.

271
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,283
You're taking him to Disneyland?

272
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,658
Well, he heard me making plans
on the phone. Was I gonna say no?

273
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,367
All right, but let me know if you're
gonna stuff him with junk food.

274
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:47,131
I don't wanna bring home a nice dinner
for him and see it go to waste.

275
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,910
We're going to Disneyland.
He's gonna eat junk food.

276
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,136
All I'm saying is give me a heads-up.

277
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,706
Okay, whatever.

278
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,085
And don't let him go on Space Mountain
after he eats.

279
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:05,714
He'll say he can handle it, but you'll
end up with churro puke on your shoes.

280
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,723
All right. Got it. Anything else?

281
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,088
Don't let Goofy near him.

282
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,924
He'll have nightmares,
and I'll have to deal with it.

283
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:16,567
- What's the problem with Goofy?
- Wish I knew. He's fine with Pluto.

284
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,532
<i>Do you think the elastic woman
in The Incredibles...</i>

285
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,407
...needs to use birth control
or can she just be a diaphragm?

286
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,346
Well, that's it. We're officially
out of things to talk about.

287
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,587
We're home.

288
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,589
It's 10:00. Where have you been?

289
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,594
We stayed
for the California Adventure water show.

290
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,699
It was pure Disney magic.

291
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,964
- I was gonna see that with him.
- How was I to know that?

292
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,467
It's all right. I'll see it again with you.

293
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,469
I have food here. You were gonna call.

294
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,938
- I know, I know.
- I can still eat.

295
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,568
No. You already threw up once.
Go put on your p.j.'s and brush your teeth.

296
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,411
Okay, but just don't fight.

297
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,314
- We're not fighting.
- Just go.

298
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,751
Aren't you gonna thank Penny
for taking you?

299
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,450
Thank you, Penny.

300
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,393
You're welcome, sweetie.

301
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,899
Want a cup of coffee?

302
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,558
Oh, I should probably get going.

303
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:27,729
- Come on, it's just a cup of coffee.
- Yeah. Okay.

304
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:38,448
Yeah, the whole thing
seems a little twisted to me too.

305
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,448
What am I smelling?

306
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,850
Sheldon's churro on my shoes.

307
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,769
Such an angel when he's asleep.

308
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,368
Yeah, shame he has to wake up.

309
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,110
I think we can do it.

310
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,716
Smother Sheldon in his sleep?
Wouldn't that be wrong?

311
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:18,120
No, be friends. You and me.

312
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,020
Oh, sure.

313
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,888
Absolutely.

314
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,724
Good. I'm glad.

315
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:30,864
Here's an idea. I'm just throwing it
out there. Friends who have sex.

316
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,073
Good night, Leonard.

317
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:39,644
Kidding. Just a couple of friends
goofing around.

318
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,809
No, Goofy, no.
