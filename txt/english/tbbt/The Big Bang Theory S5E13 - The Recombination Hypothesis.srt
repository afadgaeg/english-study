1
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,754
Feel like trying something new
for dinner?

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,090
Maybe Indian? Tex-Mex?

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,093
Ever wonder how humans would
be different if they evolved...

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,096
...from lizards instead of mammals?

5
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,350
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>:
Okay, let's talk about that.

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,854
As you know,
lizards, cold-blooded animals...

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,023
...lack the ability to sense temperature.

8
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,775
But they do move more sluggishly
when it's cold.

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,778
So lizard weathermen
would say things like:

10
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,157
"Bring a sweater, it's slow outside."

11
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,244
I love my mind.

12
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,664
We all do. Now, how about dinner?

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:45,127
Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects
or smaller lizards.

14
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:49,631
We could also pull each other's tails off
and grill them. They'll just grow back.

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,010
Oh!

16
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,805
My life-size cardboard
Mr. Spock is here.

17
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,392
I know he wouldn't care
for an outburst of human emotion...

18
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,020
...but, oh, goodie, oh, goodie,
oh, goodie.

19
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,693
Commander Spock requesting
permission to be unfolded.

20
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:14,281
- Excuse me.
- Permission granted, commander.

21
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:19,828
...which is why the more intelligent
the monkey, the more feces they fling.

<font color="#E86CE4">(KNOCKING ON DOOR)</font>

23
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,501
Excuse me, Amy.
Uh, Penny, do you have plans for dinner?

24
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,003
- You guys going somewhere?
- No, just you and me.

25
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,215
You mean, like a date?

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,217
Not like a date, a date.

27
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,346
<font color="#808080">AMY & BERNADETTE</font>:
Ooh.

28
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,015
Um...

29
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,392
Okay. Sure.

30
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,979
<font color="#808080">AMY & BERNADETTE</font>:
Ooh.

31
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,109
Oh, no. They sent the wrong Spock.

32
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,863
Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,892
This is so exciting. If Leonard
and Penny get back together...

34
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,395
...Howard and I can go
on double dates with them.

35
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,275
How come you never invite
Sheldon and me on a double date?

36
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,652
Uh...

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,612
How's it going in there, Penny?

38
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,489
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
Just a sec.

39
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,617
Too much?

40
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,453
- Yes.
- No.

41
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,250
Okay. Just hang on.

42
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,962
You just can't handle her raw sexuality,
can you?

43
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,048
When did you and Leonard break up?

44
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,884
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
Uh, about two years ago.

45
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,178
Why do you think
he asked you out again?

46
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,346
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: I don't know.
- Maybe he's dying.

47
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,432
That would be so romantic.

48
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,601
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
He's not dying.

49
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,728
Too bad.

50
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:13,025
If he were, she could throw him in bed
and ride him right up until he flatlines.

51
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,739
How about this?

52
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,700
- Maybe.
- Come on.

53
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,620
Yeah, okay, no.

54
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,997
Do you think you'll sleep with him
tonight?

55
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:31,168
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Absolutely not. We're just gonna have
dinner and, you know, see how it goes.

56
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,420
If he were dying,
would you sleep with him?

57
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,131
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: What?
- Assuming he were dying...

58
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,468
...of something that couldn't
be sexually transmitted.

59
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,679
You know,
like a spear wound to the head.

60
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,348
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
Okay, he is not dying.

61
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,142
How do you know? Are you a doctor?

62
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,311
You can make-believe though.

63
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,648
Sometimes Howard and I pretend
that his arrhythmia is acting up...

64
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,858
...and I'm a sexy cardiologist...

65
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:59,321
...and the naughty part is
I'm not in his HMO network.

66
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,619
Screw it. I'm not gonna make
a big deal out of this. It's just dinner.

67
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,914
With a dead man. Rawr.

68
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,166
Amy, stop it.

69
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,960
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

70
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,964
Relax. You know Leonard's always been
crazy about you. It's gonna be great.

71
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,676
We've finally gotten to a place where
we can hang out without it being weird.

72
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,096
- If something goes wrong, then what?
- It'll just be Sheldon and me...

73
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,765
...going on a double date
with Howard and Bernadette.

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,477
Sure. We'd love that.

75
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,023
Change your clothes,
we got a lot riding on this.

76
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,529
Hmm.

77
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:46,660
I want to build a road,
but I need wood.

78
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,247
Do either of you fellows have wood?

The object of Settlers of Catan
is to build roads and settlements...

82
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,139
...to do so requires wood.
Now, I have sheep, I need wood.

83
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,310
Who has wood for my sheep?

00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,693
More to the point,
why are you doing this?

87
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,904
- What are you talking about?
- You forget what Penny did to you?

88
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,867
It took you two years and defiling my
sister to turn that frown upside down.

89
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,203
I didn't defile your sister,
we had a relationship.

90
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,415
I heard you call her Brown Sugar.

91
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,543
In my book that's defilement.

92
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,464
- You wanna know my opinion?
- Oh, boy, do I.

93
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,508

94
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,968
No.

95
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,555
All right, then.

96
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,017
The reason you're fixated on
a good-natured simpleton like Penny...

97
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,937
...is that she's the exact opposite
of your first romantic attachment...

98
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,190
...your brilliant, yet intimidating,
mother.

99
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,484
Where on earth did you get that from?

100
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,612
It's in her book
Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.

101
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,991
That doesn't make it true.

102
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,619
It's called non-fiction for a reason,
Leonard.

103
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,704
See you later.

104
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,541
If they make a movie version
of that book...

105
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,628
...you know who should play
Leonard's mother? Sandra Bullock.

106
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,342
- Why?
- Because she's great in everything.

121
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,110
...I dreamed of moving to L.A.
and becoming a movie star.

122
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,655
Anyway, after four years
of acting lessons and waiting tables...

123
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,699
...I've done a hemorrhoid
commercial...

124
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,535
...and a production of Anne Frank
above a bowling alley.

125
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,497
So you know, dreams do come true.

126
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,418
- Your turn.
- Uh, let's see. Ahem. Uh...

I am an experimental physicist

Most of my research
is with high-powered lasers, and...

Oh, I've just gotten
a big government grant...

- Oh, God.
- What?

You'll always have feelings for me.

00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,869
- So?
- That sounds like something you'd say...

...if you didn't want a relationship
with someone.

153
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,750
"This isn't working out,
but I'll always have feelings for you."

"I'm sorry I slept with your best friend,
but I'll always have feelings for you."

- I have feelings for you.

Well, I don't know how you have

00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,995
To this day, I don't even know
what T.J. stands for.

165
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,417
Wait, if you guys didn't talk...?
Never mind, stupid question.

166
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,631
And now that I have some wood...

167
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,970
...I'm going to begin the erection
of my settlement.

168
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,849
He's got to be doing this on purpose.

169
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:07,981
Ooh, eight-thirty. You and Penny decide
to go out and paint the town beige?

170
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,235
You're 30 years old
and you live with your mother.

171
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,864
I guess it didn't go well.

172
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,450
We don't know that. Not to a certainty.

173

Can't complain, thanks for asking.

What were you doing out
at 3:00 in the morning?

227
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,258
Well... What are you doing up?

228
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,844
I was using the bathroom.

229
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,681
Yeah, well, so was I.

230
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,769
Really? I didn't see you in there.

231
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,065
Obviously.

232
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,695
When I saw that you were in ours,
I went and used another one.

233
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,615
Where?

234
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,326
Uh, the gas station across the street.

235
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,999
- In your pajamas?
- Yes.

236
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,084
Without shoes?

237
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,504
Yes.

238
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,174
On a cold winter's night?

239
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,554
Yes.

240
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,644
That seems unlikely.
Did you bring your asthma inhaler?

241
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,981
Uh, uh, yes, I did.

242
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,361
Well, then I guess it's plausible.

243
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,949
- Hang on a second, mister.
- What?

244
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,997
After you used the facilities at the gas
station, did you make a purchase?

245
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,749
What?

246
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,753
It's customary when using the restroom
at a retail establishment...

247
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,839
...to make a small purchase. Did you?

248
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,634
No.

249
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,219
Here's $2.

250
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,725

251
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,859
I don't want beef jerky.

252
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,238
It's not about you.

253
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,824
It's about a poor immigrant
from Pakistan...

254
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,328
...trying to make his way in America
by working the graveyard shift...

255
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,997
...at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.

256
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,752

He's looking for
a different parking space.

260
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,890
- Why?
- We were next to a car with an...

261
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,893
..."ask me about my grandchildren"
bumper sticker...

262
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:23,106
...and I was afraid if we ran into them
on the way out, I'd be obligated to do so.

263
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,986
I'm so disappointed
it didn't work with him and Penny.

264
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:34,325
Me too. Out of deference to them,
let's not flaunt our happy relationship.

Well, I doubt they'd wanna
talk about that, so we're fine.

268
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,677
I'm surprised to see you here

269
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,847
Well, hey, we're grown-ups.
We can still be friends.

270
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,434
Boy, I don't know if I could be friends
with Howie if we broke up.

271
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:03,104
- Why not?
- I'm a very vengeful person.

272
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,526
- Really?
- With access to weaponized smallpox.

273
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,365
Let me get you some water. You need
menus, or you know what you want?

274
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,327
Leonard knows what he wants, but it
looks like he's not gonna get it from you.

275
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,622
- Howard.
- No, that's okay, Bernadette.

276
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,833
Sometimes these things
just don't work out.

277
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,129
Yeah. It's all good. We'll always
have feelings for each other.

aren't you?

281

- I'm just making a point.
- Is the point you don't know...

282
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,188
- ...when to let something go?
- People, people, please.

283
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,398
Before you say something

You know why we can't be together?

286

- Because you always have to be right.
- That is not true.

He is wrong more than anyone I know.
