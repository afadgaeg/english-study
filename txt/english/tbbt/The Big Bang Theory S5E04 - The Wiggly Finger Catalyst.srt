00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:06,588
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: The entrance to the dungeon
is a moss-covered door.

2
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:09,967
You manage to open it
only to find yourself face-to-face...

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:13,762
...with a hideous,
foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,681
What do you do?

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,308
I say, "Hey, Ma, what's for dinner?"

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,313
Seventeen.

7
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,775
The ogre is amused by your joke
and allows you to pass.

8
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,612
By the by, I liked it too.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,116
How go the wedding plans, Howard?

10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:38,162
Great. Spent five hours last night
at Macy's registering for gifts.

11
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,207
I'm finally gonna have that earthenware
asparagus dish I've always wanted, heh.

12
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,503
See, this is the good thing about
having a girlfriend 9000 miles away.

13
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,048
I can spend my nights
doing whatever I want.

14
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,924
Like playing nerd games with us...

15
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:54,219
...and then taking
a suspiciously long shower?

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,515
Maybe.

17
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,561
We enter the dungeon.

18
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,730
You see a dragon.

19
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,524
Really?
So we're playing Dungeons and Dragons.

20
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,818
And we walk into a dungeon
and see a dragon?

21
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:15,324
- Isn't that a little on the nose?
- When you play Chutes and Ladders...

22
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,160
...do you complain about all the chutes
and the ladders?

23
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,581
Are you gonna eat that whole pie?

24
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,167
Maybe. Why not?

25
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,753
Who do I have in my life
to watch my figure for?

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,173
Oh, God,
did you watch Bridget Jones again?

27
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,968
No, it's just that
everybody's got someone.

28
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,471
Sheldon's with Amy,
Howard's getting married...

29
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,307
- ...you're dating my sister.
- Now that Howard's getting married...

30
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,268
...maybe he'll inflate
one of his old girlfriends for you, heh.

31
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,271
You know who I blame
for my loneliness?

32
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,856
The United States of America.

33
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,817
Your movies and your TV shows...

34
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:54,071
...promised streets paved with beautiful
blonde women with big bazongas.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,699
Eat another pie,
you'll have your own bazongas.

36
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,537
That's cruel.
You know it goes straight to my hips.

37
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,081
Gentlemen, please focus.

38
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,460
- You're facing a fire-breathing dragon.
- Unh, I don't know if I wanna play anymore.

39
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,172
Because you don't have a girlfriend?
If that becomes a reason...

40
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,717
...not to play Dungeons and Dragons,
this game's in serious trouble.

41
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,038
Now, I assume we use this same wax
later on...

42
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,916
...to neaten up
each other's bikini regions.

43
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,044
Yeah, my bikini region is fine.

44
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,255
Who's shocked? I'm not.

<font color="#E86CE4">(GIGGLES)</font>

46
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,760
So, Bernadette,
how's the wedding planning going?

47
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,263
And I'm not asking
as a prospective bridesmaid.

48
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,307
<font color="#E86CE4">(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)</font>
Pick me. Pick me.

49
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,978
We went cake tasting yesterday.

50
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,563
Raj came along.

51
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,900
He cried and ate half the samples.

52
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,945
Oh, poor guy. He's so lonely.
We should set him up with someone.

53
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,199
You know,
I met a really cute girl at work.

54
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,202
She's married to a guy
in one of our drug trials.

55
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,497
Well, hello? She's married, heh.

56
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,793
Yeah, but her husband
is in serious congestive heart failure...

57
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,298
...and a little birdie told me
he's in the placebo group.

58
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,970
Okay, so future grief-stricken widow
is the one to beat.

59
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,267
- You ready to order?
- One moment.

60
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,186
I'm conducting an experiment.

61
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,981
With Dungeons and Dragons dice?

62
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,776
Yes. From here on in...

63
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,488
...I've decided to make all trivial
decisions with a throw of the dice.

64
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,032
Thus freeing up my mind
to do what it does best...

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,576
...enlighten and amaze.

66
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,082
Page 14, item seven.

67
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,167
So, what's for dinner?

68
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,878
A side of corn succotash.

69
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,298
Hmm, interesting.

70
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,509
Um, Howard,
can I see you for a minute, please?

71
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:25,764
Ugh, I don't wanna show any more of your
friends how I can fit in the booster seats.

72
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,017
Uh, no, that's not it.
Just come with me, please?

73
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,815
Let's see what I'll be washing
that succotash down with.

74
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,444
A pitcher of margaritas.

75
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,698
Do you really want that?

76
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,075
That's the great thing.
It doesn't matter.

77
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,162
My mind is freed up
to think about more important things.

78
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,956
What's it thinking about now?

79
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,250
Hamburgers and lemonade.

80
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,046
Um, Raj, there's someone
I want you to meet.

81
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,466
This is my friend, Emily.
I know her from spin class.

82
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,305
No. Raj, relax.
She can't hear you. She's deaf.

83
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,393
Emily, this is our friend Raj.

84
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,854
- Heh.
- Aw.

85
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,318
Look at you guys, just hitting it off.
I am so good.

86
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,408
Hi.

87
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,370
She says, "it's nice to meet you."

88
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,874
Did she really mean that
or was she signing it sarcastically?

89
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,003
Raj says, "It's nice to meet you too." Heh.

90
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,506
Uh, she says she has to go back
to her family.

91
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,469
But Penny has her number
if you wanna text her and get together.

92
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,804
Okay, I'm gonna play it cool.

93
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,433
Tell her, "Maybe. Whatever, babe."

94
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,521
He'll text you, heh.

95
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,360
Huh. Look at that. I have a date.

96
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,736
I love America again.

97
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,075
And now for dessert.

98
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,703
Come on, hot fudge sundae.
Come on, hot fudge sundae.

99
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,414
Bam! That's what I'm talking about.

100
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,337
Okay. As soon as she gets here,
so she knows I'm cool with it...

101
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,464
...I'm going to make a joke
about her being deaf.

103

00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,931
Oh, no, I bet you didn't."

105
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,354
Maybe we should revisit
your lonely, fat guy plan, heh.

106
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,231
Oh, she's here.

107
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,235
No joke.

108
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,950
- She's sorry she's late.
- Oh, tell her it doesn't matter.

109
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,994
Tell her her eyes shimmer
like opalescent lilies...

110
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:57,040
...in the lake of the palace
of the celestial maidens.

111
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,920
Really?
That's the first thing you wanna say?

112
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,715
- I worked on it all night. Use it.
- I don't know the sign for "opalescent."

113
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,218
- Then spell it.
- I don't know how to spell it.

114
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,803
You're blowing this for me.

115
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,682
He likes your eyes, heh.

116
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,976
You're making me sound
like a caveman.

117
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,438
"Thank you, you have nice eyes too."

118
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,232
Really?
Ask her how many children she wants...

119
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,193
...and whatever number she says,
say, "Me too."

120
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,781
No.

121
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:34,703
Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice
like James Earl Jones.

122
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,540
She doesn't know
what James Earl Jones sounds like.

123
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,626
Great. Then she won't know I'm lying.

124
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,675
Let's see, what else can I tell you
about me that would make you like me?

125
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,302
Uh...

126
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,596
Oh, I love music.

127
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,724
Do you love music?

128
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,061
You really wanna ask her that?

129
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,647
Oh. You're right.
Heh, everyone loves music.

130
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,402
She says,
"Do you play an instrument?"

131
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,113
No, but when I was 6 years old...

132
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:14,993
...I tried to start a boy band
called Frankie Goes to Bollywood.

133
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,540
But I couldn't get any other boys
to join...

134
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,419
...so my parents asked the servants
to be my backup dancers.

135
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,589
Wait, when you sign servants,
don't sign it like I'm bragging.

136
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,634
Sign it in a way that I sound humble,
with just a hint of:

137
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,303
"That's right, I had servants."

138
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,225
- Do you hear yourself?
- Yes, but she doesn't.

139
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,769
So get signing, hand monkey.

140
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,985
I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus
every day.

141
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,695
And then on Christmas morning...

on a doll head. Sad face, sad face.

It's a little hard to see
with the city lights...

...but that W-shaped constellation
is Cassiopeia.

152

And she was the mother of Andromeda,
who's over there.

Look, pretty stars.

sometime.

Does she want me to kiss her or not?

- Yeah, but I'm the make-out king.

00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,413
Mustache is looking good there,
Sheldon.

168
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,169
Don't thank me. Thank the dice.

169
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,297
They told me
what percentage of my face to shave.

170
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,299
Why are you still doing this?

171
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,634
Because it's working.

172
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,054
In the past few weeks,
unburdened by trivial decisions...

173
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,515
...I've co-authored two papers
in notable peer-reviewed journals...

174
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,935
...and I'm close to figuring out
why the Large Hadron Collider...

175
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,647
...has yet to isolate
the Higgs boson particle.

176
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:53,401

because you no longer wear underpants.

178
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,080
- Is Raj out with Emily again?
- Yeah. Every night for the last month.

179
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,998
Wow. I can't believe he has a girlfriend.

180
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,418
Me neither.

181
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,756
Here's some other fun news
on the Raj-Emily front.

182
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,218
He gave her a pair of diamond earrings
and leased her a car.

183
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,844
You're kidding.

184
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,514
- Think she's taking advantage of him?
- Oh, of course not.

185
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,101
She wouldn't do something like that.
She's deaf.

186
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,231
Deaf women can't be gold diggers?

187
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,443
Handicapped people are nice, Leonard.
Everyone knows that.

188
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:41,574
I actually have information about Raj that
would be helpful with this discussion.

189
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,456
Could you tell us?

190
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,959
Let's see.

191
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,546
Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.

192
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,466
Wait. Hang on. Doubles. Roll again.

193
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,305
Okay, get this.

194
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,475
It doesn't matter
if he's showering her with gifts...

195
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,520
...because the Koothrappalis
are vastly wealthy.

196
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,400
- What do you mean "vastly wealthy"?
- Well, "wealthy" means a lot of money.

197
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,611
"Vastly" means even more.
I'm not sure what's tripping you up.

198
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,948
I know they have money.
I don't think it's that much.

199
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,826
No, you're wrong.
As you know, a few years ago...

200
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,580
...I achieved one of my lesser dreams
and became a notary public.

201
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:33,460
Well, from time to time,
I notarize banking documents for Raj.

202
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:38,047
The Koothrappalis aren't just rich,
they're Richie Rich rich.

203
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,384
Well, so how much is that?

204
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,013
About halfway between Bruce Wayne
and Scrooge McDuck.

205
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,224
The last time we went to the zoo...

206
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,269
...that son of a bitch
made me buy him a churro.

207
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,482
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude
but I need to go call Raj's sister...

208
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,650
...who I love so much.

209
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,446
Ahem, so vastly much.

210
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,994
Okay, so he's got money,
and it's a few gifts, and a car.

211
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,747
And she got him
to pay off all her credit cards.

212
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,500
What? He paid off her credit cards?

213
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,377
Damn it, I could have dated Raj
for a couple months.

214
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:22,258
But I wouldn't have because I'm not that
kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.

215
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,053
He's not gonna listen, he's in love.

216
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,640
Can't figure out what to do?
I remember those days.

217
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,268

He hasn't dated
a whole lot of women.
