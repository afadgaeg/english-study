1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,560
Smell that?

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,143
That's the smell of new comic books.

3
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:18,016
They're on me today, boys.

4
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:19,388
You're paying?

5
00:00:19,513 --> 00:00:21,732
Have you been selling
your sperm again?

6
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:24,553
No, I'm celebrating.

7
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,607
As we speak,
the space shuttle is docking

8
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,377
at the International Space Station

9
00:00:28,502 --> 00:00:32,003
where it will deploy the Wolowitz
Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.

10
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:36,160
Get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.

11
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:40,944
Just think. Thanks to your hard work,
an international crew of astronauts

12
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:43,919
will "boldly go
where no man has gone before."

13
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:47,640
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.

14
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,572
The combination of
the <i>Star Trek</i> reference

15
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:52,531
and the play on words involving
the double-meaning of the verb "to go"

16
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:55,429
suggests that Leonard is mocking
your efforts in space plumbing.

17
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,724
Okay, make your little jokes,

18
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,920
but of the four of us,
I'm the only one making

19
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:04,228
any real-world contribution
to science and technology.

20
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:07,063
He's right. This is an important
achievement, for two reasons.

21
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:08,364
Number one...

22
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:10,070
and, of course, number two!

23
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,257
Clever!

24
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:16,213
Playing on the use
of cardinal numbers

25
00:01:16,338 --> 00:01:18,590
as euphemisms for bodily functions.

26
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:25,417
Here, Sheldon,
I pulled the new Hellboy for you.

27
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:26,987
It's mind-blowing.

28
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,561
Excuse me.

29
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:30,296
Spoiler alert.

30
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:32,633
I didn't spoil anything.

31
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,275
You told me it's mind-blowing.

32
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,428
So, my mind is going into it
pre-blown.

33
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:40,098
And once a mind is pre-blown,
it cannot be re-blown.

34
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:41,600
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,811
Said the Grinch to Christmas.

36
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,079
- Can I talk to you about something?
- What's up?

37
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:52,818
Remember I went out with Penny,
a couple weeks ago?

38
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:55,094
- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure you remember.

39
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,277
You went to the bar
and made a fool of yourself

40
00:01:57,402 --> 00:01:59,120
trying to pick up strange women.

41
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:03,779
What about it?

42
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:07,960
The thing is,
the date didn't go that well.

43
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:10,151
Too bad.

44
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,971
I guess the thing to do now
is just pick yourself up,

45
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:16,093
dust yourself off,
forget it and move on.

46
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:18,609
- I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?

47
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,903
'Cause we're going out
again tomorrow.

48
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:23,310
Excuse me, Stuart.

49
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,051
Have you read the new Flash?

50
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:27,747
Well, I have
and it will knock your socks off!

51
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,233
Good luck getting them back on.

52
00:02:35,107 --> 00:02:38,991
This is probably my last shot with Penny
and I don't want to screw it up.

53
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,559
Nobody wants that.

54
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,212
So, here's my question:
It's the second date,

55
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,496
you think she'll be expecting things

56
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,631
to get physical?

57
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:52,126
Gee...

58
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:55,552
My initial reaction is "no,"

59
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,136
but let me think about it
and get back to you.

60
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,928
So, you'll give me a call?

61
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,180
- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.

62
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:05,956
Or nobody calls anyone.

63
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,083
Interesting.

64
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,476
Penny's current suitor asking advice
from her former suitor.

65
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:15,152
You know, thanks
for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.

66
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,649
Hey, wanna make sure
he gets nowhere with Penny

67
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:20,449
without jeopardizing your friendship
with either of them?

68
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:22,116
I'm listening.

69
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,472
Just tell him to do everything
you've done with her

70
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,287
for the last two years.

71
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:52,814
Subtitles: The FW Team

72
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,007
- How's it going?
- Good, good. You?

73
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:02,225
Fine.

74
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,534
Can I ask you something?

75
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,451
Sure.

76
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:07,932
You know your friend Stuart?

77
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:12,083
He asked me out again
and I said yes,

78
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,753
and then I started thinking
maybe I should talk to you first.

79
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:16,004
About what?

80
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,552
Does it bother you,
me going out with one of your friends?

81
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,051
'Cause you know, you and me...

82
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:23,872
No, that's the past.

83
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:26,566
I'm really more
of a "right now" kind of guy.

84
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:28,542
You know, living in the moment.

85
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:32,896
Although I do have to live a little
in the future, 'cause that's my job.

86
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:35,495
Of course, my fondness
for classic science fiction

87
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,338
does draw my attention backwards,

88
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:40,428
but those stories often
take place in the future.

89
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,908
In conclusion, no,
it doesn't bother me.

90
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,116
Okay, well,
that's really cool of you.

91
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:53,668
I wouldn't say cool.
I'd just say... "That's Leonard!"

92
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:57,729
In that case,
do you mind giving me some advice?

93
00:04:57,854 --> 00:04:59,004
About Stuart?

94
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:00,304
Love to.

95
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:02,298
He's very shy.

96
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:04,577
How do I make him feel
more comfortable around me?

97
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:07,761
First of all, don't underestimate
the value of discomfort.

98
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,276
Really?

99
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:12,115
Stuart thrives under pressure.

100
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,465
That's why he works in
a comic book store.

101
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:23,947
It's Stuart.

102
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,452
You're not going to answer it?

103
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,582
He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't want to talk about Penny.

104
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:35,750
You're making an assumption.

105
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,462
Perhaps the comic book store
is on fire.

106
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:42,132
And he needs your assistance.

107
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,350
Why would he call me?

108
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:46,660
We don't know.

109
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:50,307
And if you don't answer the phone,
we can't know.

110
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:54,102
I'm not answering the phone.

111
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,275
Answer the phone, Leonard.

112
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,696
There, it went to voice mail.

113
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:13,330
Aren't you going to check
your messages?

114
00:06:16,782 --> 00:06:18,418
You have to check your messages!

115
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:21,315
The living of a message
is one half of a social contract

116
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,215
which is completed by the
checking of the message.

117
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,010
If that contract breaks down,

118
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:30,368
then all social contracts break down
and we descend into anarchy.

119
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,833
It must be hell inside your head.

120
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:38,632
At times.

121
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,275
Guys, we have a code red.

122
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:45,286
"Code Red" the hospital emergency alert,
the computer worm,

123
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:48,615
or the cherry-flavored soft drink
from the makers of Mountain Dew?

124
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:51,951
Look, I was going over the schematics
on my zero-G toilet,

125
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:53,473
and I made a teeny tiny mistake

126
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:55,414
on the specifications
for the diverter valve.

127
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,373
How teeny tiny?

128
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,416
It's gonna fail
after about ten flushes.

129
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,380
- But the mission is for six months.
- See, that's the code red.

130
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:06,133
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.

131
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:08,103
No one knows exactly when,
but at some point

132
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,971
something way worse than a puppet
is gonna pop out of that box.

133
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:14,808
Have you notified NASA?

134
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,622
Are you crazy?
What am I gonna say?

135
00:07:16,747 --> 00:07:19,180
"I screwed up your toilet
and there's gonna be crap floating

136
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,356
"all over your nice
shiny space station"?

137
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:23,175
What are you gonna do?

138
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,944
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it,
then I'll tell them.

139
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,673
So, what do you need us for?

140
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:29,876
He can't figure out how to fix it.

141
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:32,450
You said you were
gonna be supportive.

142
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,203
I'm trying, but you have to admit
this is pretty damn funny.

143
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:38,582
I agree.

144
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:41,456
It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech
nature of space exploration

145
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:43,518
against the banality
of a malfunctioning toilet

146
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:45,577
that provides the comic fodder here.

147
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:51,927
Check your messages.

148
00:07:54,947 --> 00:07:57,190
All right,
this is an exact duplicate

149
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:00,410
of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Disposal System

150
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:02,439
as deployed on the
International Space Station.

151
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,902
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Distribution System?

152
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:09,815
Good one.

153
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,705
It's hilarious. Now...

154
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,382
Here's an approximation

155
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:20,241
of the spare parts
available on the Space Station.

156
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,322
We gotta find a way,
using nothing but this,

157
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:25,378
to reinforce this so the waste material
avoids the spinning turbine.

158
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:27,806
You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?

159
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:33,564
I have to say,

160
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:37,112
I thought the toilet humor would
get less funny with repetition.

161
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:38,741
Apparently, there is no law

162
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,393
of diminishing comedic returns
with space poop.

163
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,160
You busy?

164
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:51,404
Classified, Leonard.

165
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,366
Yeah, it's a regular
Manhattan Project.

166
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,576
What's up?

167
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,469
Tonight's my date with Penny

168
00:08:58,594 --> 00:09:00,664
and since we haven't been able
to connect by phone...

169
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,249
I'm sorry, it's been broken.

170
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,306
- Or e-mail.
- Yeah, that too. Everything's broken.

171
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,837
Anyway, I was just wondering
if you had any last-minute advice.

172
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,684
All right, well,
off the top of my head,

173
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:16,929
I think the most important thing
with Penny is to go really slow.

174
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,112
I mean, glacial.

175
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,664
Guys come onto her all the time,
so, you need to set yourself apart.

176
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,519
Be a little shy,

177
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:31,628
don't make too much eye contact.

178
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:35,215
And, you know, treat her
with, like, cool detachment

179
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,605
and-and, you know, fear.

180
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:40,996
- Fear?
- Yeah, like,

181
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:44,753
you're afraid
that if you touch her, she'll break.

182
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:48,426
Well, that plays
right into my wheelhouse.

183
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:52,382
Good, good.
You kids have fun tonight.

184
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:54,120
Thanks, Leonard.

185
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,801
What is that thing anyway?

186
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,388
You don't know what this is?

187
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,515
Good. Get out.

188
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:05,976
Be afraid of Penny.

189
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:07,731
Nice. Very crafty.

190
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:11,877
It wasn't bad advice.
It's just wasn't particularly helpful.

191
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,947
For what it's worth, my mother says

192
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,009
that when we deceive
for personal gain,

193
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,900
we make Jesus cry.

194
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:31,505
All right, what if we use
this two-inch PVC

195
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,424
- to reinforce the center cross-support?
- No good.

196
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:36,864
It might work for the Japanese
and the Americans,

197
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:40,138
but have you seen the size
of the Russians they got up there?

198
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:46,493
This thing has to hold up
against a hearty potato-based diet.

199
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:49,767
I feel terrible.

200
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,402
Maybe if you were helping,
you'd feel better about yourself.

201
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:57,345
I deliberately tried
to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.

202
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,967
Of course you feel terrible.
You completely screwed up your karma.

203
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:03,579
You don't really believe
in that superstition, do you?

204
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:06,581
It's not superstition.
It's practically Newtonian.

205
00:11:07,142 --> 00:11:09,584
For every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

206
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:12,588
Leonard pretends to be a friend
and acts like a two-faced bitch.

207
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:18,634
Therefore, he is reborn
as a banana slug.

208
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:24,433
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.

209
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:27,597
Speaking of what goes around
comes around...

210
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:29,770
Okay, look.

211
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:32,725
Instead of trying to reinforce
this structure here,

212
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,360
what if we just ran another line,
bypass it entirely?

213
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,112
It won't work. The diameter
of the tubing is insufficient.

214
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:40,282
What if we reposition
the collection tank?

215
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,075
It won't work. No way to mount it.

216
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:44,675
Okay, here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live

217
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,372
with my cousin and her husband, Avi,
in Israel?

218
00:11:49,512 --> 00:11:50,795
That could work.

219
00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:58,745
- Morning.
- Morning. What's up?

220
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,996
Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter
trying to fix a zero-gravity...

221
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,248
pasta maker.

222
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:07,642
I'm gonna make a coffee run.
Do you want any?

223
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,144
No, thanks. I have coffee.

224
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:11,688
Great. So how'd it go
with Stuart last night?

225
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:15,400
I really don't want
to talk about it.

226
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:17,309
Yeah. Right. Sure.

227
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,524
The thing is,
before you guys went out,

228
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:20,836
I spoke to him and...

229
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:22,824
I said I don't want
to talk about it.

230
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:24,387
I just... I kind of...

231
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:26,774
What goes on between me and Stuart
is none of your business.

232
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:28,538
So just leave it alone, okay?

233
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,287
If you want to clean up your karma,
go get my freakin' latte.

234
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,076
Hang on, I think I've got this.
Help me see if we can wedge

235
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,353
this little piece of PVC
behind the support rod.

236
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:53,522
You're overestimating
the tensile strength

237
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,190
of the substructure you're building.

238
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,067
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.

239
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,890
If you knew what you were doing,
there wouldn't be a space toilet

240
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:01,822
where my coffee table should be.

241
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:04,199
Howard, wait.

242
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:06,622
Why don't you use this
instead of the PVC

243
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:08,954
to keep the transverse
filter assembly in place?

244
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:11,837
Because this is not a spare part
from the space station.

245
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:13,629
This is the thing from the pizza box

246
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:16,420
that keeps the lid
from touching the cheese.

247
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,756
That what that's for?
In India, the lid touches the cheese.

248
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:23,582
Of course, we also have rampant poverty
and periodic outbreaks of cholera,

249
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:26,346
so a little cardboard in our cheese
is no biggie.

250
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:30,350
- Where are you going?
- Comic book store.

251
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,773
An excellent idea!
I could certainly use a break.

252
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:35,397
- Me, too.
- You can go to the comic book store

253
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,858
when man can once again
safely poop in space.

254
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,152
Why does Leonard get to go?

255
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,440
'Cause he's upset
over his situation with Penny

256
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:45,574
and if I have to hear about it again,
I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.

257
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:50,077
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
- I got your back, sister.

258
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,272
All right, I think we've got
a prototype ready to test.

259
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:55,625
Hand me that Tupperware.

260
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,949
That's heavy.

261
00:13:58,074 --> 00:14:00,255
Damn right it's heavy.
It's my mother's meat loaf.

262
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:03,977
It's been testing toilets
for generations.

263
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:06,370
I must say,

264
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:10,010
I think a detailed letter to MIT
describing your current circumstances

265
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:12,476
might entitle you
to a refund on your master's degree.

266
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,702
Okay, simulated zero-gravity
human waste disposal test

267
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:19,608
with meat loaf analog in...

268
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,820
three, two, one.

269
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:31,333
Fascinating.

270
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:35,338
What do you think the problem is?

271
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:37,274
Not enough bread crumbs.

272
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:46,927
Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.

273
00:14:47,097 --> 00:14:49,652
- Sure, what's up?
- I gave you bad advice about Penny,

274
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:52,724
- and I want to apologize.
- No, your advice was great.

275
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,310
- It was?
- Yeah, going slow really worked.

276
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:57,048
You're kidding.

277
00:14:57,872 --> 00:14:59,329
Never worked for me.

278
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,272
Last night at dinner,
I did what you told me.

279
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:05,000
I went really slow,
I kept my distance,

280
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,614
and two bottles of wine later,
we were making out in my car.

281
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:11,192
Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

282
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,121
It doesn't matter,
that's where it all went to hell.

283
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,672
During the kissing?

284
00:15:16,797 --> 00:15:20,149
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.

285
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:24,798
No, everything was good
and really hot.

286
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,675
And I said,

287
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:27,917
"Oh, Penny,"

288
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:31,210
and right where she was supposed to say,
"Oh, Stuart," she said...

289
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:33,515
your name.

290
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,772
That is your name, right?

291
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:47,279
I'm sorry. That must've been
the last thing you wanted to hear.

292
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:51,723
It beats,
"You know I'm a dude, right?"

293
00:15:54,678 --> 00:15:56,537
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

294
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:58,597
No doubt, no doubt.

295
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:05,077
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

296
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,339
Not your fault.

297
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:08,193
Yeah, how about that?

298
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:12,935
- See you soon.
- Sure.

299
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:29,988
Yes, sir, I understand "classified."

300
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,991
We'll keep it all classified;
no one has to know but you and me.

301
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:34,909
What's classified?

302
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:38,161
Howard's space toilet.
I'll tell you later.

303
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:41,584
Well, they've deployed our solution.

304
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,579
Let's just all hope it works.

305
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,140
I don't see why I have to worry.

306
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:48,935
My career's not hanging
in the balance.

307
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:56,556
That was a joke.

308
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:58,530
It's funny,

309
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:00,620
because it's true.

310
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:07,258
Leonard, could you pass
the soy sauce, please?

311
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:08,985
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

312
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,092
Yeah, I said "Leonard."

313
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,132
Yes, you did, didn't you?

314
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:21,914
What the hell is that?

315
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:23,673
Meatloaf.

316
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,045
What was it doing on the ceiling?

317
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,303
That's classified.

318
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:38,169
<i>Houston,
International Space Station.</i>

319
00:17:38,294 --> 00:17:40,499
<i>We have a little situation up here.</i>

320
00:17:41,323 --> 00:17:43,834
<i>We'd like to make
an unscheduled space walk.</i>

321
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:46,738
<i>I.S.S., Houston.</i>

322
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:49,416
<i>Which crew members would be
involved in this E.V.A.?</i>

323
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,696
<i>Houston, we'd all like
to step outside for a few minutes.</i>

324
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:57,937
<i>I.S.S., I'm afraid
we can't authorize that.</i>

325
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,865
<i>Houston,
this is more of an FYI call.</i>

326
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,984
<i>We are basically out the door.</i>
