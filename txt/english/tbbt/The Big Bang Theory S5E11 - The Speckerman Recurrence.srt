00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,715
Hi. Did Sheldon
change the Wi-Fi password again?

3
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:12,886
Uh, yeah, it's "Penny already eats
our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi."

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,015
No spaces.

5
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:20,519
Okay. What makes you think you
can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,313
I believe that you're capable
of great change.

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,109
Like, when I finally got you
to stop saying "Valentime's Day."

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,195
- Wanna hear something weird?
- Sure.

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,114
In the year 2000...

10
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:37,244
...Pope John Paul II was named
an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.

11
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,540
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,710
You asked Penny if she wanted
to hear something weird.

13
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,254
Well, yeah, because I have
something weird to tell her.

14
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,758
Oh. I thought it was a game.

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,554
- What's yours?
- There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman.

16
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,931
He used to torment me
in high school.

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,892
He sent me a message
through Facebook.

18
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,811
- He's in town and wants to have drinks.
- Okay, Penny.

19
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,938
If it were a game,
here are your choices.

20
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,940
An e-mail from an old acquaintance...

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,736
...or the head of one of the largest
religious institutions in the world...

22
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,531
...slam-dunking
to "Sweet Georgia Brown." Pick.

23
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,745
Just do it,
because he's not gonna let it go.

24
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,956
- Basketball Pope.
- And that's how it's done.

25
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,418
What are you gonna do?

26
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,462
- Are you gonna see him?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,840
Is this the fellow who peed
in your Hawaiian Punch?

28
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,301
No, that was a different guy.

29
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,971
Was he the one who wedgied you
so hard your testicle reascended...

30
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:42,059
...and you spent your whole Christmas
break waiting for it to come back down?

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,564
No, that was a different different guy.

32
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,568
Was he the one who used your head
to open a nut?

33
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,239
- No.
- Oh, oh, oh.

34
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,325
Was he the one
who made you eat your arm hair?

35
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,621
No, but actually,
that was this guy's sister.

36
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,874
- Well, what do you think he wants?
- I don't know.

37
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,918
The holidays
are just around the corner.

38
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,964
Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge
the other testicle up there.

39
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,049
I told you. That was a different guy.

40
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,720
Mm, that's too bad. Could've spent New
Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.

00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,892
<font color="#E86CE4">(LAUGHS)</font>

42
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,839
It's 2 a.m. What are you doing up?

43
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:58,844
Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony
streaming live from Stockholm.

44
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,182
Sure. Wanna see what all the scientists
are wearing this year.

45
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,642
Look at these men.

46
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,687
They've managed to win
the top science prize in the world...

47
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,773
...with no more understanding
of the quantum underpinnings...

48
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,194
...of the expansion of the early universe
than God gave a goose.

49
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,116
You should pay attention, Leonard.
Someday it's gonna be you up there.

50
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,037
- Thanks.
- So, what's got you up?

51
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,664
Did you have a bad clam?

52
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,834
- I didn't have clams.
- I don't watch you 24 hours a day.

53
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,003
I don't know what you do.

54
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,467
It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing.
I can't decide if I should agree...

55
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,262
...to see him or not. That might be
because the last time I ran into him...

56
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,307
...he made me floss
with my own shoelaces.

57
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,684
Wear loafers.

58
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,981
Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there
clutching that Nobel Prize.

59
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,817
What's the matter, Saul?
Afraid someone's gonna steal it?

60
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,946
Like you stole Einstein's
cosmological constant?

61
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:04,034
You know what?
I am tired of living in fear of this guy.

62
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,953
I'm gonna go see him...

63
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,789
...and say the things
I should have said in high school.

64
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,749
"Pick on someone your own size."

65
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,336
"No, you did not have sex
with my mother."

66
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,507
And, "Yes, I do know
why I'm hitting myself."

67
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,968
Oh. Now Perlmutter shaking
the king's hand.

68
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,263
Yeah. Check for your watch,
Gustaf, he might've lifted it.

69
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,684
I love this dress.

70
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,562
- How come I never see you wear it?
- Because when I wear it, it's a shirt.

71
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,900
So, what's Howard doing tonight?

72
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,653
Oh, they all went with Leonard
to confront his childhood bully.

73
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:44,408
Oh. Terrific. High-school quarterback
against four mathletes.

74
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,078
When Leonard gets back,
I'd love to check serotonin levels.

75
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,914
Do you think he'd let me
draw a syringe full of his blood?

76
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,958
Hmm. He's not crazy about needles.

77
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:57,004
But if you get him to go jogging,
it'll just pour out of his nose.

78
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,382
I don't think I can meet the girl
who was always mean to me.

79
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,510
Tammy Bodnick.
One time while I was in gym class...

80
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,181
...she stole all my clothes
and left an elf costume in my locker.

81
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,103
- Oh, that's awful.
- Worst part was it was too big.

82
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:19,151
That's nothing. In ninth grade,
the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion.

83
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,237
Within six months,
the nicknames began to fly.

84
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,866
I think the one that hurt the most
was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.

85
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,162
Oh. Wow, you poor thing.

86
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,247
What about you?

87
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,542
Oh, I don't know. My school
was a nice place. We didn't have bullies.

88
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,546
Come on, no one ever gave anyone
mean nicknames, or picked on them...

89
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:44,593
...or put gum in their hairy knuckles
so the nurse had get it out?

90
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,303
No, we weren't really like that.

91
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,056
We played pranks on each other,
but it was never mean.

92
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,351
This girl, Kathy Geiger, got good grades
so we blindfolded her...

93
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,395
...tied her up
and left her in a cornfield overnight.

94
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,651
- God. That's awful.
- No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.

95
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,904
Did Kathy Geiger laugh?

96
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:08,533
Uh, probably. It's hard to say. She kind
of had an ear of corn in her mouth.

97
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,370
Who would've thought?

98
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,748
Fuzzy Fingers Fowler
is best friends with a bully.

99
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,294
- What...? I was not a bully.
- Kind of sounds like you were.

100
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,296
And maybe a felon.

101
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,719
Shh. That's how you
wind up in a cornfield.

102
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,267
Is that him over there?

103
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,769
No.

104
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,147
How about that guy?
He looks like he'd hate you.

105
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,359
- I can really do this by myself.
- We're here to support you.

106
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:46,780
No, you're not. You're here to see if I
get my underwear pulled over my head.

107
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,366
You wore underwear?
Ha, ha. You fool.

108
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,287
- You figured out what you're gonna say?
- You bet.

109
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:58,542
I am going to make him apologize for
all the crap he pulled on me in school.

110
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,795
That's quite a list.
I can't read your handwriting.

111
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,088
What's that word?

112
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,549
Scrotum.

113
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,218
What's that one?

114
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,512
Uh, stapled.

115
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,265
Leonard?

00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,521

- Holy crap, man, it's good to see you.

118
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,273
Yeah, you too.

119
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,025
Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon, and Raj,
and Howard.

120
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,528
- Hi.
- Fellows. Can I get a beer?

121
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,322
Wow, look at you.
Little Leonard Hofstadter.

122
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,366
I hear you're a big-time scientist now.

123
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,743
And there's the first zinger. Ouch.

124
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,706
- I'm doing okay, I guess.
<font color="#808080">JIMMY</font>: Okay?

125
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:42,085
Come on, I read online you're a physicist
at a university. You won some medal.

126
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,629
- The Newcomb medal.
- Yeah. Congratulations.

127
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,882
Congratulations?
For the Newcomb med...?

128
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,092
Oh, please.
That's the scientific equivalent...

129
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,887
...of a smiley-face sticker
on your homework.

130
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,557
- It sounded like a big deal.
- Oh, good Lord.

131
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,895
Are we gonna stand here and listen
to him tear Leonard apart like this?

132
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,106
- Hey, I won a Newcomb medal too.
- My point.

133
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,110
You should've seen this guy
back in the day. Huh?

134
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,154
He was so little,
he could fit anywhere.

135
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,281
Lockers, trash cans.

136
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,367
Oh, man,
how did you get inside that backpack?

137
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,998
Oh, I can't take all the credit.
You helped a lot.

138
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,753
- We were practically a comedy team.
- Like the Black Death in Europe.

139
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,382
Jimmy, I'm kind of curious
why you wanted to see me.

140
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,385
Okay, here it is.
I have this great money-making idea.

141
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,846
I need a gear-head
to get it to the finish line.

142
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:39,518
Mm, technically, Howard's the gear-head.
Leonard's just a dime-store laser jockey.

143
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,019
What's the idea?

144
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,480
- This is just between us, right?
- Right.

145
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:48,443
Okay. What do you think about a pair of
glasses that makes any movie into 3D?

146
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,615
That sounds amazing.
First movie I'm watching, Annie.

147
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,911
How exactly
would these glasses work?

148
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,956
How the hell should I know?
That's why I need a nerd.

149
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,668
I don't think something
like that's even possible.

150
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,004
Aw, come on. You could figure it out.
You're, like, the smartest guy.

151
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,924
The smartest...? All right.

152
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:16,096
I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm,
but, uh, even I know that was a doozy.

153
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,100
You can't live
in fear of this man forever.

154
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,186
- Sheldon, I got this.
- You clearly don't.

155
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,855
What my spineless friend
lacks the courage to say...

156
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,776
...is you're a terrible person
who took advantage of his tiny size...

157
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:34,072
...his uncoordinated nature,
and his congenital lack of masculinity.

158
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,575
- Sheldon.
- Leonard, I platonically love you, man.

159
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,368
But face it, you're a mess.

160
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,248
I don't understand.

161
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,209
I think what he's trying to say
is that maybe...

162
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,712
...in high school,
you picked on me a little bit.

163
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:53,508
A little bit? The man super-glued
Hershey's kisses to your nipples.

164
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,223
That's funny because those aren't the
kind of kisses you want on your nipples.

165
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,310
- What is that?
- This is a list...

166
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,478
...of your heinous acts
against Leonard...

167
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:10,483
...one of which is certainly the cause of
him wetting his bed well into his teens.

168
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,446
Fourteen is not...
Uh, yeah, never mind.

169
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,241
What's this word?

170
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,702
Nancy.

171
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,456
You called me Nancy
for three years.

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,127
You really need to work
on your penmanship.

173
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,380
Man, I...

174
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,633
I don't know what to say.

175
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,676
I thought
we were just having some fun.

176
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,511
Well, it wasn't fun for me.

177
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,974
You're being too kind, Leonard.
You ruined him.

178
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,477
Come on, guys.

179
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,105
- That was pretty bad-ass, dude.
- I help the weak.

180
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,483
It's yet another way
I'm exactly like Batman.

181
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,029
And for the record,
Jimmy wasn't the reason I wet the bed.

182
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,491
That one has my mother
written all over it.

183
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,831
Anyway, I'm really sorry I made fun
of your stutter in high school.

184
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,875
You're doing great.

185
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,919
Uh-huh.

186
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,256
Uh-huh.
Oh, God, just finish the sentence.

187
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,930
Ah. Okay, well,
I'm sorry you feel that way.

188
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,390
Bye.

189
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:27,352
- No one wants to hear my apologies.
- Your mistake is doing it over the phone.

190
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,355
I mean, if they could look into your eyes,
they'd melt.

191
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,443
It doesn't matter what you did
in the past. You're a good person.

192
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:40,615
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
You weren't just called a "b-b-bitch."

193
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,245
Perhaps you could assuage your guilt
through altruism.

194
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,209
Which word's tripping you up?

195
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,294
Assuage or altruism?

196
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,881
Both.

197
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,051
You'll feel better
by doing something nice for someone.

198
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,179
- Oh, I actually knew that.
- I never doubted you.

199
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,766
Every other week,
I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.

200
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,935
Ooh. I can't do that.

201
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,855
If I stand over a steaming pot,
my hair just goes: "Boing!"

202
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,025
- Ah. What else can I do?
- There's Habitat for Humanity.

203
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,736
Building houses for the poor.

204
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,239
I don't have my own house,
I'm gonna build one for someone else?

205
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,701
How about donating
some of your clothes?

206
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:29,247
Oh, my God, that's perfect, because
I have so many clothes I don't wear.

207
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,791
They're taking up space
I go shopping to buy more.

208
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,294
I have no place to put it.
This would fix that.

209
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:38,214
- What about helping people?
- And helping people.

210
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,302
- Here's your cocoa.
- Oh.

211
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,846
- Half and half instead of whole milk?
- Yes.

212
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,140
- Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
- Yes.

213
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,101
Seven little marshmallows,
no more, no less?

214
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,644
You got one for good luck.

215
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,188
<font color="#E86CE4">(KNOCKING ON DOOR)</font>

216
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,939
I'll get it.

217
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,566
One for good luck.

218
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,943
Must be the kind of math
they do at Princeton.

219
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,784
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

220
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,871
I wanna apologize
for stapling your balls...

221
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,209
...throwing you naked
into the girls' locker room...

222
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,128
...stuffing that parrot
down your pants.

223
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,089
What's this word?

224
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,425
- Laxative.
- Oh.

225
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,261
Right. Junior prom. Ha, ha.

226
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,598
That was not cool, man.

227
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,476
I am so, so sorry.

228
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,603
- Really?
- Yeah.

229
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,356
I just hope you can forgive me.

230
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:40,068
Uh... Yeah. Sure, I guess.

231
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,989
- You're a beautiful guy.
- Oh, well, yeah. Thanks, Jimmy.

232
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,784
Okay, I gotta go.

233
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,619
- Are you okay to drive?
- Yeah, yeah.

234
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,788
I drive better drunk, you know?

235
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,665
It makes you pay attention.

236
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,211
No. Come on in.
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

237
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,921
- I wouldn't be imposing?
- No.

238
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,631
Yes.

239
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,678
- Sheldon, we can't let him drive.
- Then take away his keys...

240
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,722
...and make him wander the streets
with the other drunks.

241
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,185
You remember Sheldon, and Raj,
and Howard.

242
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,895
Not really, no.

243
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,984
It's funny, huh? Back in school,
I was the winner, and you were the loser.

244
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,527
And now we're reversed.

245
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,154
You're the winner.

246
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,658
You'd think a winner
could make a decent cup of cocoa.

247
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,663
- Mind if I use your bathroom?
- Yeah. It's just back there.

248
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,209
How about that?
After all these years...

249
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,297
...your big, bad high-school bully
finally apologizes.

250
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:47,135
Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith
in the basic goodness in people.

251
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,388
- You know what would be nice?
- What's that?

252
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:55,226
As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies
who've tormented us for years...

253
00:14:55,436 --> 00:15:00,648
...we open our home to Jimmy,
and once he's asleep, we kill him.

254
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,365
I said it would be nice.
I didn't say we should do it.

255
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,662
Oh. I feel just like Mother Teresa.

256
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,790
Except for the virgin part.
That ship sailed a long time ago.

257
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,130
I think Mother Teresa
would've washed the clothes first.

258
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,967
Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room
wasn't down five flights of stairs.

259
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,554
You know, giving really
is better than receiving.

260
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,600
Oh. I used to think it was such a cliché,
but it seems to be the...

261
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:39,312
Ah! Look at these cute jeans
someone just threw away.

262
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,230
Donated.

263
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,487
Yes, to a poor waitress
who loves a boot-cut.

264
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,366
- Penny.
- Come on. They would be so cute on me.

265
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,910
Ah! They'd go great with this sweater.

266
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,914
I don't think Mother Teresa would...
Oh, that is adorable.

267
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,636
- Leonard?
- Yeah?

268
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:16,683
In case it comes up again,
this right here is an imposition.

269
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,562
What was I supposed to do?
He needed a place to sleep.

270
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:26,234
You're soft. This world's
gonna chew you up and spit you out.

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,492
Morning, Jimmy.

274
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,286
Oh, there it is. Tacos.

275
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,291
- Man, I tied one on.
- Yeah, you did.

276
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,628
So, uh, listen,
it was great to see you again.

277
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,089
And thanks for the apology.

278
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,299
What apology?

279
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,469
For all the crappy stuff you did to me
in high school.

280
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,015
Oh, jeez, you're still harping on that?
What a puss.

281
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,477
- That's my French toast.
- It's good.

282
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,814
You really know your way
around a kitchen, Nancy.

283
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:10,653
I'm not going to say I told you so,
but we could've killed him.

284
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,283
I might kill him right now.

285
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,702
The Dark Knight has your back.

286
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,496
He's scared, but he has your back.

287
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,749
Hey, Jimmy, it's time for you to go.

288
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,293
- Yeah, let me just finish this.
- No. You're done.

289
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:29,255
- I want you out of my apartment now.
- Well said, Boy Wonder.

290
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,051
Or what?

291
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,471
Don't answer. That's a trick question.
I speak from experience.

292
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,809
I'm not afraid of you anymore, Jimmy.

293
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,895
Now, get out.

294
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,147
Uh-oh.

295
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,692
You did it.
You stood up to your bully.

296
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,528
Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself.

297
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,491
Do you think we can outrun him?

298
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,869
I don't need to outrun him.
I just need to outrun you.

299
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,001
I don't feel good about this.

300
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,962
Well, then, sit in the car
and keep it running.

301
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,799
You were right. A whole new load.

302
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,679
Come on, yoga top.
Momma needs a new yoga top.

303
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,432
Check it out, Bernadette.
Suede boots. Your size.

304
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,145
God, they're cute.
Oh, why did they have to be cute?

305
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,815
Wait, wait, wait, guys. Just hang on.

Oh, look at us. What are we doing?

00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,408
I was following you
to a life of crime...

309

...looking forward
to the day we might be cell mates.

I don't know about Bernadette.

311

No, this is wrong.
