1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,770
Knight to queen's bishop-five.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,260
Oh, very nice. What's
Leonard going to do?

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,930
Does he give up the pawn or
does he give up the position?

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,690
Let's find out. Leonard, ready?

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,130
Ready.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,950
Go.

7
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,110
Damn it. I slipped.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,090
Too bad. You know the rules of
Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,300
Leonard died again, Sheldon. You're up.

10
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,860
Despite my deep love of chess, lasers
and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,920
Why?

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,540
- Because it's almost 11:00.
- So?

13
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,470
So, Penny has a "don't knock on my door before
11:00 or I punch you in the throat" rule.

14
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,850
Hey, you know what'd be a great idea?

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,510
We get some girls over here and
play Laser Optical Strip Chess.

16
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,660
Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing
to play that, you don't want to see naked.

17
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,030
You underestimate me.

18
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,140
Penny. Penny. Penny.

19
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,670
Hey, Sheldon.

20
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,910
- It's 11:00 a.m.
- I know. You're safe.

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,300
This package came
while you were at work.

22
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,130
Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.

23
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,180
- Excuse me.
- What?

24
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,590
- You have to sign this.
- What is it?

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,730
When I signed for the package, I was
deputized by the United Parcel Service

26
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,200
and entrusted with its final delivery.

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,200
I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package
so that I'm fully indemnified and no longer liable.

28
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,470
Sheldon, it's just a box of rhinestones.

29
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,590
Well, the contents are irrelevant.
A legal bailment has been created.

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,210
Does that mean nothing to you?

31
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,960
It means nothing to anybody.

32
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,680
Come here, let me show
you what I'm doing.

33
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,050
Bailment describes a
relationship in common law

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,200
where a physical possession of
personal property, or "chattels, "

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,280
is transferred from one person, the
bailor, to another person, the bailee...

36
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,790
ah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look!
I started a business.

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,480
Obviously, not a cleaning business.

38
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,340
No, I'm making flower barrettes. See?

39
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,910
I call them Penny Blossoms.

40
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,050
I made one for myself, then all
the girls at work wanted one.

41
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,460
Then I showed some to this lady
who runs a shop in Old Town.

42
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,030
She sells cards and homemade jewelry.
She said she wanted to sell them.

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,700
I said, "Okay." And in
one week, I made a $156.

44
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,790
Good for you. Sign here.

45
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,640
Sheldon, don't you get it?

46
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,910
If this takes off, I won't
have to be a waitress anymore.

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,510
But then who will bring me my
cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?

48
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,240
- Another waitress.
- What's her name?

49
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,840
I don't know.

50
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,090
And you're going to
let her handle my food?

51
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,370
Nancy. Her name is Nancy.

52
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,300
I think you're just making that up.

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,910
Sheldon, I'm sorry about
your hamburger, okay?

54
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,120
I just don't want to be a
waitress for the rest of my life.

55
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,290
Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.

56
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,760
Fine, cheeseburger.

57
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,170
Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,400
So, what do you think? I mean, this
could be a business, right?

59
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,780
How many of these can you make a day?

60
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,950
About 20.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,470
And how much profit do you
make per... Penny Blossom?

62
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,450
I don't know, like,50
cents. I'm not sure.

63
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,950
Of course you're not. All right...

64
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,000
Ten dollars a day times five days a
week times 52 weeks a year is $2,600.

65
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,730
- That's all?
- Before taxes.

66
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,150
I don't have to pay taxes on this stuff.

67
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,780
I believe the Internal Revenue
Service would strongly disagree.

68
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,130
But, if you took advantage of modn marketing
techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, 

69
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,730
you might be able to make
this a viable business.

70
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,520
And you know about that stuff?

71
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,730
Penny...

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,260
I'm a physicist.

73
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,090
I have a working knowledge of the entire
universe and everything it contains.

74
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,930
Who's Radiohead?

75
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,710
I have a working knowledge of the
important things in the universe. Good luck.

76
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,540
Sheldon, hold on.

77
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,690
Could you maybe show me how
to make more money with this?

78
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,660
- Of course I could.
- Sheldon, wait!

79
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,420
Will you?

80
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,880
Just to be clear here, you're
asking for my assistance.

81
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,760
Yes.

82
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,650
And you understand that will
involve me telling you what to do?

83
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,900
I understand.

84
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,610
And you're not allowed to be sarcastic
or snide to me while I'm doing so.

85
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,460
Okay.

86
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,160
Good.

87
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,980
Let's begin with the premise that everything
you've done up to this point is wrong.

88
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,720

Oh, imagine that.
89
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,310
- Sarcasm. Good-bye.
- No, sorry. Wait!

90
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,130
Please come back!

93
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,370
<font color=#00FFFF>The Big Bang Theory
Season02 Episode18</font>

94
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,040
There. Done.

95
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,100
All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.

96
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,510
Pretty good, right?

97
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,940
That's 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour.

98
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,060
Based on your cost of materials
and your wholesale selling price, 

99
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,710
you'll effectively be paying
yourself... $5.19 a day.

100
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,550
A day?

101
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,450
There are children in a sneaker
factory in Indonesia who outearn you.

102
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,500
That just can't be right.

103
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,010
- You're questioning my math?
- No, sorry.

104
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,110
- Want me to show my work?
- Oh, God, no.

105
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,740
- Just please tell me what to do about it.
- All right.

106
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,010
Are you familiar with the development
that resulted from Honorï¿½ Blanc's

107
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,520
1778 use of interchangeable parts?

108
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,920
The assembly line, of course.

109
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,920
Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be
snide, you're not allowed to be condescending.

110
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,520
That wasn't a part of our original
agreement, and I don't agree to it now.

111
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,910
All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up
machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,440
You're thinking of the moving assembly line, an
understandable but not excusable mistake.

113
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,530
No. The...

114
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,160
The moving assembly line, that was
introduced by Henry Ford in 1908.

115
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,590
That innovation is what made
possible our modern consumer culture

116
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,390
by enabling a low-unit
cost for manufactured goods.

117
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,650
I guess that isn't one of the
topics discussed on your Radiohead.

118
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,820
Let's go. We're going to
miss the coming attractions.

119
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,340
What's the matter?

120
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,120
I think I bruised a testicle
capturing that last pawn.

121
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,140
# Please pay attention and listen to me #

122
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,470
# Give me some time
to blow the man down #

123
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,810
# I'm a deepwater sailor
just come from Hong Kong #

124
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,880
# Give me way, hey, blow the man down #

125
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,030
# If you give me some
whiskey I'll sing you a song #

126
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,910
# Give me some time
to blow the man down #

127
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,130
Hello?

128
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,150
- Hello.
- Hello.

129
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,830
# Come quickly lay aft
To the break of the poop #

130
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,060
# To me way, hey, blow the man down #

131
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,120
# Or I'll help you along
with the toe of my boot #

132
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,770
# Give me some time
to blow the man down #

133
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,150
W-W-Wait, what's
going on?

134
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,180
I assume you're referring
to the sea shanty.

135
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,070
It's a rhythmic work song
designed to increase productivity.

136
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,700
Yeah, it's crazy, but it totally works.

137
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,030
Look, we made this Penny
Blossom in under three minutes.

138
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,020
Terrific, but that kind of raises
more questions than it answers.

139
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,640
Penny's making hair accessories.

140
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,190
I'm helping her optimize
her manufacturing process.

141
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,220
All right, break's over.

142
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,950
# Pay attention to orders
now you one and all... #

143
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,760
Hold on. What are you
using as a bonding agent?

144
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,090
- Hot glue.
- You're kidding.

145
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,680
Any of the cyanoacrylates
would do a better job.

146
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,620
It won't work, the flower's too porous.

147
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,480
What if we infused the bottom layer with
silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?

148
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,670
Intriguing.

149
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,160
Good question. What are you marketing
and distribution channels?

150
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, there are the waitresses at my
work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town...

151
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,970
Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush--
virtually non-existent.

152
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,360
I'm thinking that we set her up with a
hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.

153
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,020
Why not eliminate the middle man?

154
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,070
We could install a small server farm
with a static IP in her bedroom.

155
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,050
She'd need some kind of
industrial cooling system.

156
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,420
Of course, but before we set up a
marketing and distribution infrastructure, 

157
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,950
we should finish optimizing
the manufacturing process.

158
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,890
To start with, she has a terrible problem
with moisture-induced glitter clump.

159
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,420
Yeah, it's a bitch.

160
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,620
Uh, I've seen this before.

161
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,970
Where?

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,420
It's a common stripper problem.

163
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,480
They dance, they sweat, they clump.

164
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,650
Are you thinking about adding a
desiccant like calcium sulfate?

165
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,270
Actually, I'm thinking about
this one stripper named Vega.

166
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,880
But sure, calcium sulfate could work.

167
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,230
Let's think out of the box for a moment.

168
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,210
How about a molecular sieve?

169
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,100
I've got a spaghetti
strainer in the kitchen.

170
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,800
Wow.

170
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,240
Hey, we could liberate some
micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.

171
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,620
Oh, great. Raj, why don't you
and Howard go get the charcoal?

172
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,630
Leonard, why don't you start working
on some preliminary Web site designs.

173
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,480
I'll make some space in our apartment
so we can move the manufacturing process.

174
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,680
Well, what's wrong with my apartment?

175
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,860
It's not my apartment.

176
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,420
Wait, wait, what am I going to do?

177
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,090
Uh, hey, it's your business.
Do whatever you want.

178
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,480
Okay, cool.

179
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,410
I'm going to take a nap.

180
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,870
I'm still tweaking things a little bit, but this
will give you the general idea of the Web site.

181
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,510
So, what do you guys think?

182
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,770
Uh, pretty much any way I say that
is going to hurt his feelings.

183
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,520
Okay, what's wrong with it?

184
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,870
- What's wrong with it?
- Not you. I wasn't asking you.

185
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,900
Penny?

186
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,390
Uh, well, it's a little juvenile.

187
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,390
I mean, it kind of looks like the
MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.

188
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,600
No, it doesn't.

189
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,850
Please. Dateline could use
it to attract predators.

190
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,600
Penny, this is your enterprise, so
it's ultimately your decision, 

191
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,590
but based on the quality of his work, I'd
strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.

192
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,340
You want to fire me?

193
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,060
What I want is irrelevant.
This is Penny's decision.

194
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,890
Penny?

195
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,500
Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job
then why do we already have orders?

196
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,810
- We do?
- Look.

197
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,720
Mrs. Fiona Fondell from
Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.

198
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,670
No kidding. Two?

199
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,970
Look at the comments.

200
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,750
"Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will
be perfect to cover my bald spot."

201
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,540
that... that is so sweet.

202
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,140
Camouflaging bald spots.

203
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,970
That's primarily a male concern.

204
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,580
Perhaps we could expand our market.

205
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,540
How are flower barrettes
going to appeal to men?

206
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,530
We add Bluetooth!

207
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,370
Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.

208
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,470
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want
to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?

209
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,620
Penny, everything is
better with Bluetooth.

210
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,910
Holy crap. Someone just ordered
a thousand Penny Blossoms.

211
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,190
Get out!

212
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,650
Who needs a thousand sparkly
flower barrettes with rhinestones?

213
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,580
"The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New
Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau."

214
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,470
Oh, another market to expand
into-- balding gay men.

215
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,900
And I'll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.

216
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,100
We should get to work.

217
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,340
Wait, wait, why does
it say "one-day rush"?

218
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,480
Since when do we offer a one-day rush?

219
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,550
Amazon offers one-day rush.

220
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,010
Yeah, but they don't have
to glue the books together.

221
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,750
How the hell are we going to make a
thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?

222
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,560
Don't yell at me. I'm not
manufacturing. I'm just Web design.

223
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,680
Okay, well, I'm gonna have to
call them and cancel the order.

224
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,000
Excuse me, but was this not your goal?

225
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,820
Financial independence through
entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation?

226
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,340
My brilliance and
innovation, of course, but still.

227
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,410
I just don't see how
we can pull this off.

228
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,510
That, right there, that equivocation and
self-doubt, that is not the American spirit.

229
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,160
Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo?

230
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,010
Did Jim Bowie?

231
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,200
They didn't quit. They were massacred...

232
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,870
by like a gazillion angry Mexicans.

233
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,840
Let me put it this way.

234
00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,690
Your gross receipts on this one order
will be over $3,000 for one night's work.

235
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,930
You guys get started.

236
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,080
- What are you doing?
- Going online to buy shoes!

237
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,480
She'll be coming round
the mountain when she comes

238
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,020
She'll be coming round
the mountain when she comes

239
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,430
She'll be coming round the mountain
She'll be coming round the mountain...

240
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,560
You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday
nights doing this, I could have stayed in India.

241
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,750
Oh, stop with the fake third world crap.

242
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,130
Your father's a gynecologist. And
you had a house full of servants.

243
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,920
We only had four servants.

244
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,550
And two of them were children.

245
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,810
How we doing?

246
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,360
We have 128 assorted Penny
Blossoms ready to ship.

247
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,290
Oh, God, we're never gonna finish in time.

248
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,190
Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?

249
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,570
I believe I'm hearing some
negativity on the factory floor.

250
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,770
So?

251
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,960
Penny, the labor force is a living
organism that must be carefully nurtured.

252
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,650
Any counterproductive grumbling must be
skillfully headed off by management. Observe.

253
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,950
Less talk, more work!

254
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,230
- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

255
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,380
You hear any union talk, you let me know.

256
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,190
# Someone's in the
kitchen with Dinah... #

257
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,220
# Someone's in the
kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow #

258
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,460
# Someone's in the
kitchen with Dinah... #

259
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,170
Sheldon? Sheldon!

260
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,410
'Cause I sold my soul
to the company store.

261
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,390
Honey, do you want some coffee?

262
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,440
I don't drink coffee.

263
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,110
Come on, but if you don't stay
awake we'll never finish in time.

264
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,870
I'm sorry, coffee's out of the question.

265
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,940
When I moved to California, I promised my
mother that I wouldn't start doing drugs.

266
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,640
Leonard, help.

267
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,380
Sheldon, we still have 380
of these things to make.

268
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,490
I have complete faith that
you will make them. Good night.

269
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,730
Leonard?

270
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,850
But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership
this entire enterprise will surely fail.

271
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,850
You're right, of course.

272
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,040
Here, this will help.

273
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,600
Very well, but if this leads
to opiates or hallucinogenics, 

274
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,540
you're going to have
to answer to my mother.

275
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,850
Look at Planck's Constant.
People say it's arbitrary.

276
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,590
It could not be less arbitrary.

277
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,380
If it varied slightly, life as
we know it would not exist. Bam!

278
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,580
Now, now, let's reconsider the entire argument, but
with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause.

279
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,060
So you are thinking of a universe
that's not expanding from the center--

280
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,940
no, it is retreating from
a, from a possibility space. Bam!

281
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,260
This is a space where we are all
essentially Alice through the looking glass, 

282
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,850
standing in front the Red Queen, and we're
being offered a cracker to quench our thirst.

283
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,150
Bam!

284
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,700
Of course, in another universe, let's
call it universe prime, 

285
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,990
there's another Sheldon, let's
call him Sheldon prime...

286
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,080
- We should have let him go to bed.
- Bam.

287
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,670
I can't believe we actually did it.

288
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,090
1,000 friggin' Penny Blossoms.

289
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,670
I just want you guys to know I
am really grateful for your help.

290
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,360
And for ever dollar I make, I'm
going to give you 20 cents.

291
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,710
That's your entire profit margin.

292
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,850
Then never mind.

293
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,770
I'll print out the shippi label.

294
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,400
What?

295
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:55,540
We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New
Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance.

296
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,520
They want another
thousand Penny Blossoms.

297
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,920
Really?

298
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,210
One-day rush.

299
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,260
I really need to take
that off the Web site.

300
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,740
Okay, well. Guess we'd better get started.

301
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,000
You can't be serious.

302
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:19,280
Come on. What about the living organism
of the workforce and the American spirit?

303
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,740
And Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?

304
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,550
Davy Crockett. Jiminy
Crockett was a cricket.

305
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,170
Yes, yes, I know that, okay?

306
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm tired-- I've had
like 18 cups of coffee.

307
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,810
The point is, if we just
pull together, we can do this.

308
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,280
Who's with me?

309
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,380
Penny, although you may find it
hard to believe, we do have lives.

310
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,550
Leonard?

311
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,890
Sorry.

312
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,910
My apologies to the gay community
of East Rutherford, New Jersey.

313
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,900
Zoom, zoom, zoom!

314
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,650
Where's the coffee?

315
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,040
We're all out.

316
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,200
No problem.

317
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,810
I'll be back before this
banana hits the ground.

318
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,680
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!

319
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,180
Yes!

320
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:57,170
Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser
Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.
