1
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,192
Water Demon.

2
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:11,502
Ice Dragon.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,673
Lesser Warlord
of Ka'a.

4
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:18,709
Not so fast.

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,477
Infinite Sheldon.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,614
Infinite Sheldon?

7
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:26,317
Yes, Infinite Sheldon
defeats all other cards

8
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,903
and does not violate the
rule against homemade cards

9
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,821
because I made
it at work.

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,659
Do you understand why people
don't want to play with you?

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,261
No...

12
00:00:37,262 --> 00:00:40,698
although it's a question I've
been pondering since preschool.

13
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:42,750
Hey.

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,717
Hey.

15
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:45,469
Hey.

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,421
Hey, your copy of <i>Science</i>
magazine was in my mailbox.

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,340
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

18
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,575
Check it out--
all about planets this month.

19
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:53,611
That's an atom.

20
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,081
Agree to disagree.

21
00:00:57,949 --> 00:00:59,450
That's what I love
about science--

22
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:02,152
there's no
one right answer.

23
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:07,224
So...

24
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:08,826
you and Zack again, huh?

25
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:10,761
Yeah, yeah, me
and Zack again.

26
00:01:10,762 --> 00:01:12,363
Were we here earlier?

27
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,199
Okay, we should,
we should go.

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,250
Ah, not yet.

29
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,619
I want to talk science
with the science dudes.

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,406
Oh, and the science dudes want
to talk science with you.

31
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:24,875
What do you want
to talk about--

32
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:29,013
rocks, dinosaurs, our
friend the beaver?

33
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:32,516
You know, I saw this great thing
on the Discovery Channel.

34
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:34,385
Turns out
that if you kill a starfish,

35
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,553
it'll just come back to life.

36
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:40,224
Was the starfish
wearing boxer shorts?

37
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,493
Because you might have
been watching Nickelodeon.

38
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:48,899
No, I'm almost sure that
it was the Discovery Channel.

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,167
It was a great show.

40
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:52,336
They also said dolphins
might be smarter than people.

41
00:01:52,337 --> 00:01:55,940
They might be smarter
than <i>some</i> people.

42
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,661
Maybe we can do an
experiment to find out.

43
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,112
That's easy enough.

44
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:05,215
We'd need a large tank of
water, a hoop to jump through,

45
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:07,651
and a bucket of whatever
bite-sized treats

46
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:09,787
you find tasty.

47
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:18,162
I don't get it.

48
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:19,596
A dolphin might.

49
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:24,201
Oh, I see.

50
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:26,337
You guys are inferring
that I'm stupid.

51
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:27,604
That's not correct.

52
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,491
We were implying it.

53
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:32,710
You then inferred it.

54
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:38,682
Let's go.

55
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:41,652
You know, for a group of guys

56
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:44,288
who claim they spent most
of their lives being bullied,

57
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,839
you can be real jerks.

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,658
Shame on all of you.

59
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:52,329
What the hell did I do?

60
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,831

71
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:22,719
Do you think
Penny's right?

72
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:24,449
Were we bullying Zack?

73
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,200
No,

74
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,655
I know bullying.

75
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:30,492
He left here unswirlied and his
ass crack was underpants-free.

76
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,529
And nobody drew
a penis on his forehead.

77
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,666
That happened to you?

78
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,335
First day of cricket camp.

79
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:43,772
They drew it
so the testicles were my eyes.

80
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,745
I don't know, I think
we might owe the guy an apology.

81
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:52,214
So go apologize.
Why me?

82
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:55,384
You started it,
we just piled on.

83
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:57,352
What would I even say?

84
00:03:57,353 --> 00:04:00,055
Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid.

85
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:04,326
Have a Milk Dud.

86
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:07,196
A Milk Dud?
Yeah,

87
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,631
Milk Duds,
with their self-deprecating name

88
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,333
and remarkably mild flavor,

89
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,304
are the most apologetic
of the boxed candies.

90
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:16,705
I got a better idea.

91
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:17,673
We're all responsible.

92
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,874
I say we all go.

93
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:24,079
Come on, who's with me?

94
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:29,184
Free comic books
to anyone who comes with me.

95
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,354
I might get punched.
You really want to miss that?

96
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:39,962
Junior Mints are
pretty apologetic.

97
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,130
You're embarrassing
yourself.

98
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:48,570
Penny.

99
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:54,209
What?
Yeah,

100
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,911
we came to talk to Zack.
Hey, Zack.

101
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:57,112
What do you want?

102
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:58,480
Listen,

103
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,581
the stuff
we were saying before--

104
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:01,149
we were just kidding around.

105
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,084
No, you weren't.

106
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,752
You were making fun
of me.

107
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:05,387
Come on, that's what we do.

108
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,489
We give each other a hard time.

109
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,690
Hey, Sheldon,

110
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,893
you look
like a praying mantis.

111
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:13,795
That's very hurtful.

112
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:16,098
See?

113
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:18,934
I don't know,
it still wasn't very nice.

114
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:21,436
Milk Dud?

115
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:23,205
Oh, I love Milk Duds.

116
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,875
Okay, we're cool.

117
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:31,547
Junior Mints.

118
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:33,115
You guys want to come in
and have a beer?

119
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:34,917
Uh, we're on our way
to the comic book store.

120
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,618
Leonard's buying.

121
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:37,653
Really?

122
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:38,854
I haven't been
to a comic book store

123
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:40,422
in literally
a million years.

124
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,024
Literally?

125
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:45,360
Literally a
million years?

126
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,062
Don't.

127
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:48,330
You want to go with 'em?
No.

128
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:49,731
Okay, see you later.
Wait,

129
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:54,503
w-w-w-wait, you're ditching me
to go look at comic books?

130
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:55,704
Are you mad at me?

131
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:58,440
I'm not happy.

132
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,510
Milk Dud?

133
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:07,249
Wow, this place
is awesome.

134
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,551
Where do they keep
the <i>Archies?</i>

135
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:12,921
In the bedrooms of ten-year-
old girls, where they belong.

136
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,807
Oh, no, you're thinking
old-school <i>Archie.</i>

137
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,626
It's much more
sophisticated now.

138
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,727
Like, there's
two universes,

139
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:20,662
and Archie's married
to Betty in one

140
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:21,730
and Veronica
in the other.

141
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:24,032
Midge is even breaking
up with Moose.

142
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,934
No.

143
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:27,636
About time, right?

144
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,137
Hey.

145
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,608
Hey.
You guys finally chip in
for a bodyguard?

146
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,677
Uh, no. Oh,
this is Zack.

147
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:37,079
He's a friend
of ours.

148
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,980
Zack, this is Stuart.

149
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,815
He owns
the store.

150
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,416
Wow, lucky you.

151
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:44,152
Yeah, I work
70 hours a week

152
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,022
and average
$1.65 an hour.

153
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:49,358
Sweet.

154
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:52,527
Is that sarcasm?

155
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:56,164
No, it's an indictment of the
American education system.

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,934
The <i>Archies</i> are over here.

157
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:00,886
Yippee.

158
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:05,407
So are you guys coming to
my New Year's Eve costume party?

159
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:06,675
Of course.

160
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,694
We're coming as the
Justice League of America.

161
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,811
Switching it up from last year

162
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:12,731
when we came as
the Justice League of America.

163
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,982
To that point,

164
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:17,753
it occurs to me that we
might have an opportunity

165
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:20,255
to finally snare
Best Group Costume

166
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,691
if we shore up
our weak link,

167
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,494
which is clearly
Leonard as Superman.

168
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,430
Hey, I got
new boots this year.

169
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,799
Guaranteed to add
three inches.

170
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,669
That's sad.

171
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,740
Is there anyone we know

172
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:43,278
who would make a more manly
and convincing son of Krypton?

173
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,580
Than Leonard
in high-heeled boots?

174
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:49,718
Howard's mother
in high-heeled boots?

175
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:55,791
I was thinking specifically
of the gentleman over there

176
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,492
moving his lips
as he enjoys

177
00:07:57,493 --> 00:07:59,795
the latest exploits
of Betty and Veronica.

178
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,767
Zack?

179
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:09,404
He is the only person we know
with actual muscles.

180
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,507
You can't replace
me with Zack.

181
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:15,243
Why not?
Penny did it.

182
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,179
Yeah, she seems happier.

183
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,580
Why wouldn't we be?

184
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,981
Score.

185
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:21,950
I got an <i>Archie,
Betty and Veronica,</i>

186
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:23,251
and a <i>Jughead.</i>

187
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,421
All set
for my weekend number twos.

188
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,458
Congratulations.

189
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,095
Zack, how would you
like to be Superman?

190
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,298
I don't know, sounds like
a lot of responsibility.

191
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,337
Fine, if Zack's going
to be Superman,

192
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:43,739
I want to be
Green Lantern.

193
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,706
But I'm Green Lantern.

194
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:46,124
You can be Aquaman.

195
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,459
I don't want to be Aquaman.

196
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,661
He sucks.

197
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:52,781
He sucks
underwater.

198
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,585
He sucks
fish pee.

199
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:57,753
Excuse me,

200
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:01,156
I believe Aquaman uses
his telepathic powers

201
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:05,460
to request the fish do
their business elsewhere.

202
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,062
Hey, babe.

203
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,146
I'm still mad at you.

204
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,131
Well, you won't be

205
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,232
when you hear the great news.

206
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,266
What great news?

207
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,868
We're going to
a costume party

208
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:15,403
at the comic book store
on New Year's Eve,

209
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:18,173
and you get to
be Wonder Woman.

210
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,677
Complete with bulletproof
bracelets and lasso of truth.

211
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,447
Invisible plane sold separately.

212
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,749
Wait, why me?

213
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,751
Wh-Why can't your girlfriend
be Wonder Woman?

214
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:32,320
She and her lab team
are under quarantine.

215
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,890
Seems at the Christmas party
they were doing Jell-O shots

216
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:38,960
out of petri dishes that used
to contain yellow fever.

217
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:42,998
Okay, what about
your friend Amy?

218
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,101
Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't
believe in wearing costumes.

219
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:49,171
She isn't the free spirit I am.

220
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:52,841
Okay, well, forget it.

221
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,509
I'm not spending
my New Year's Eve

222
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,345
at a comic book store
wearing a Wonder Woman costume.

223
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:02,651
He says he'll wear it
if you'll be Aquaman.

224
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:17,679
What are you doing?

225
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:19,551
We're going
to be late.

226
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:22,170
I'm pacing nervously.

227
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:23,405
You're jogging.

228
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:26,741
This is how the
Flash paces.

229
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:29,411
Just chill out, Sheldon.

230
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:32,347
I'm not Sheldon.
I'm the Flash.

231
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:33,949
And now I'm going
to the Grand Canyon

232
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,250
to scream in frustration.

233
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:37,485
I'm back.

234
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:43,258
I'm Batman.

235
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,460
Oh, I hardly think so.

236
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:47,996
The real caped crusader calls
his crime-fighting cohorts

237
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:49,097
when he's running late.

238
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:51,499
I had to walk.

239
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,569
I couldn't get Raj
on the back of my scooter.

240
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,412
I've said this before,
and I'll say it again.

241
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,582
Aquaman sucks.

242
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,151
Look up in the sky.
It's a bird. It's a plane.

243
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:14,756
I forget the rest.

244
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:19,728
All right. Let's get
this thing over with.

245
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,429
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,265
But in what universe
is Wonder Woman blonde?

247
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,235
Relax. No one's going to
be looking at her hair.

248
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,440
Ow!

249
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,276
I mean,

250
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,444
ow.

251
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:38,647
Hold on. The costume came

252
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:39,781
with a black wig.
Where is it, babe?

253
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,816
No. I'm not wearing
it. It looks stupid.

254
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:43,418
Come on. We're trying
to win a contest here.

255
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:44,686
Forget it. I'm not
wearing the wig.

256
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:48,823
Honey, there's no "I"
in "Justice League."

257
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,345
Well, actually...

258
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,864
Don't.
He's making our case.

259
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,732
Okay, babe. Uh...

260
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:00,902
Kind of embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

261
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,637
Okay.
You know what?

262
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,639
I changed my mind.
I'm not going.

263
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:08,326
Looks like someone
else is going

264
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,745
to have to be Wonder Woman.

265
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,785
Babe, open up.

266
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,319
I'm not talking to you.

267
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,522
Then who are you talking to?

268
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,494
Babe?

269
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,364
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny,

270
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:32,166
Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,

271
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,535
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny

272
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:34,769
Penny, Penny...

273
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,689
What the hell
is wrong with you?

274
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,873
I'm the Flash.

275
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:40,575
I just knocked 30,000 times.

276
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:42,727
Okay. What do you
want, Sheldon?

277
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,547
I understand
why you're upset.

278
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:46,948
Really?

279
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:48,316
Yes.

280
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:51,619
You're afraid that costume
makes you look fat.

281
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:54,956
No.

282
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:56,124
Wh-What...

283
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,159
Does it?

284
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,527
Don't worry.

285
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,062
Wonder Woman
was an Amazon.

286
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:05,767
And Amazons tend to
be very beefy gals.

287
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,722
Good-bye, Sheldon.

288
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,877
But they're not blonde,
so put on your wig.

289
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,048
Hello?

290
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:34,162
Stupid Aquaman.

291
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:37,298
If it makes you
feel any better,

292
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:38,533
when I was dating Penny,

293
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,101
she used to flip out
on me all the time.

294
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:42,337
Whoa. You dated Penny?

295
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,707
She didn't tell you?

296
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,942
She told me she dated
a guy named Leonard.

297
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,078
Who would have
thought it was you?

298
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,747
Who else would it be?

299
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,550
I don't know. Somebody
bigger and...

300
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,153
Yeah, sure.
Why not you?

301
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,092
I may have failed.

302
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,729
Okay, I guess we just go
without a Wonder Woman.

303
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,063
I don't want to go
without Penny.

304
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:12,767
Oh, great. No Superman,
no Wonder Woman?

305
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,203
All we've got is a skinny Flash,

306
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:16,638
an Indian Aquaman,

307
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,639
a nearsighted
Green Lantern,

308
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,874
and a teeny, tiny
Dark Knight.

309
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,380
Obviously, we're no longer
a Justice League.

310
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:29,617
We have no choice but to switch
to our Muppet Baby costumes.

311
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,421
Ooh, I call Kermit.

312
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:35,457
I'm Kermit.
You're Scooter.

313
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,860
Oh, man.
Scooter sucks.

314
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:42,664
He's the Aquaman
of the Muppet Babies.

315
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,401
No, we can still
make this work.

316
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:47,969
Leonard,
you talk to Penny.

317
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,971
What makes you think
I can convince her?

318
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,806
You got her
to have sex with you.

319
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,859
Obviously, your superpower
is brainwashing.

320
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,748
Okay, let me see
if I understand this.

321
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:02,984
You want me
to convince my ex-girlfriend

322
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,753
to go to a costume party
with her new boyfriend

323
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:07,822
just so we can win
a stupid prize?

324
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,592
Yes. And make her wear
the black wig. Good luck.

325
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,462
Go away, Sheldon.

326
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:15,763
It's Leonard.

327
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:17,098
Oh.

328
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:19,350
Go away, Leonard.

329
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,569
Come on, let me
just talk to you.

330
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,771
It's open.

331
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:25,573
Hey.

332
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:27,342
I'm not going
to that party, Leonard.

333
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,811
Okay, listen.
You don't have to wear the wig.

334
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:31,813
At this party,
we're gonna win first prize

335
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:33,915
just by showing up with a girl.

336
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,018
It's not the wig.

337
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,786
Did I do something?

338
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:40,488
I mean, I tried to be
friends with Zack,

339
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:42,991
like you said, which believe me,
was difficult,

340
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:45,360
given how you and me
used to be...

341
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,961
you know, "you and
me," and now you

342
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,464
and him are
"you and him."

343
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:52,600
Okay, look.
We're not really "me and him."

344
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,235
Then what are you?

345
00:15:54,236 --> 00:15:56,203
I don't know.

346
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:58,439
I only started seeing Zack again

347
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,475
so I wouldn't be alone
on New Year's Eve.

348
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:02,710
How pathetic is that?

349
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,246
Not as pathetic
as dressing up like this

350
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:08,316
and going to a comic book store
on New Year's Eve.

351
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:10,985
You make a cute Green Arrow.

352
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,059
Green Lantern.

353
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,162
Like there's a difference.

354
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:23,131
There's a big difference.

355
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,166
Arrow.

356
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,268
Lantern.

357
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,973
Whatever. Look,
if Zack and I had just gone

358
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:34,408
to a regular club or a party,
it would have been fine,

359
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,410
but this, with the costumes,
and you...

360
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:37,845
What about me?

361
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,383
Nothing.

362
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:44,469
Let's go to the party.

363
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,421
How do I look?

364
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,329
Um...

365
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,764
I guarantee you'll be
the prettiest girl there.

366
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,169
Okay, the good news is,
we have a Wonder Woman.

367
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,287
Oh.
Yes.

368
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,404
What's the bad news?

369
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:04,739
Superman probably isn't

370
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,608
getting laid tonight.

371
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:11,462
Aw, damn.

372
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:14,716
And the award

373
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:17,218
for best group costume
goes to...

374
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:20,221
Justice League of America...

375
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:26,894
Number three!

376
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:33,368
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

377
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:36,237
Okay. Okay, ten
seconds to midnight.

378
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:37,372
Ten, nine, eight...

379
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:38,823
No, wait!

380
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,174
I have a speech.

381
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:41,743
Seven, six...
Stop counting!

382
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:44,479
Five, four, three...
This is my moment, dag nab it!

383
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,780
Two, one!

384
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:49,834
Happy New Year!

385
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:03,164
I'm not going
to say another word

386
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,533
until you people settle down.

387
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,505
I'm waiting.

388
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,777
That was a
great party.

389
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,363
We should dress like
this all the time.

390
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,199
Are you high?

391
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,317
You're being
a bully.

392
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,489
Check it out.

393
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,024
Those guys are breaking
into that car.

394
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,060
What should we do?

395
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:33,795
We're the Justice League
of America.

396
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:36,497
There's only one thing
we can do.

397
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,933
Turn around
and slowly walk away.

398
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:49,093
Nah.

399
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,262
Hold up.

400
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,830
Look, I know our winter
thermostat setting

401
00:18:57,915 --> 00:18:59,582
is 72 degrees,
but I'm a little warm,

402
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,117
so I'm going
to turn it down.

403
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,210
Good Lord,

404
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:31,781
how you frustrate me,
Leonard Hofstadter!

405

406
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:51,640
Fine.
