00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,462
Oh, my God, I love this chicken.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:10,426
Oh, you know what they say,
"The best things in life are free."

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,095
You're right. I eat your food a lot.
How about this?

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,264
You can raid my fridge
any time you want.

5
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,807
Oh, that's very kind of you.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,060
Next time I have a hankering
to wash down a D-cell battery...

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,147
...with a jar of old pickle juice,
I'll come a-knocking.

8
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:27,151
Hey, Raj, you didn't send your RSVP in.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,820
I'm supposed to ask you
if you're bringing someone.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,113
I'll let you know.

11
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,991
Could you make it soon?
There's a battle over seating.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,203
In one corner, Bernadette's mom.
In the other three, mine.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,999
Yeah, I hate wedding receptions.
I wish the bride and groom...

14
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,001
...would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins.

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,129
Slip on the ring, disappear,
and everyone goes home.

16
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,965
Oh, you liked Professor Geyser's wedding.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,468
They had a make-your-own-sundae bar.

18
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,845
Oh, that was a night to remember.

19
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,974
Do you know, on one trip,
I just had a bowl of nuts.

20
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,061
Anyway, you gotta let me know
if you have a plus-one.

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,563
If not, my mom's trying
to sneak in the doctor...

22
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,648
...who sucked the fat out of her neck.

23
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,737
All right, uh, fine.

24
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,906
I'm coming and I'm bringing somebody.

25
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,449
Koothrappali plus one.

26
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,494
- Who are you bringing?
- Who are you bringing?

27
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,746
He's bringing me. Who are you bringing?

28
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:24,416
Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O'Donnells.

29
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,752
Come on, who is it?

30
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,798
I'm not telling. I'm from Asia.
I'm mysterious. Deal with it.

31
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,593
Howard, are you having
a make-your-own-sundae bar?

32
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,512
Uh, I don't think so.

33
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,556
Well, you should.
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce.

34
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,268
But 100 percent of make-your-own-sundae
bars end in happiness.

00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:15,759
- Hello, Mommy, Daddy. How are you?
- Pretty good, can't complain.

37
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,096
Oh, I'm sure you can.
Just give it a minute.

38
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,306
Listen, uh...

39
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,308
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

40
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,479
I wasn't ready until now
but I think it's time.

41
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,897
It's finally happening.

42
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,400
You're coming out of the closet,
aren't you?

43
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,487
We love you
and we accept your alternate lifestyle.

44
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,782
Just keep it to yourself.

45
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,368
No, I'm not gay.

46
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,621
If anything, I'm metrosexual.

47
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,331
What's that?

48
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,835
It means I like women
as well as their skin-care products.

49
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,920
Well, if you're not coming out...

50
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,423
...why did you call us
during the cricket semi-finals?

51
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:58,510
I'm tired of trying to meet someone...

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,513
...and I think I'd like you
to help me find a...

53
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,056
A wife.

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,894
And just to clarify, a female wife?

55
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,313
Yes!

56
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,107
Matchmaking. Very smart move, son.

57
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,110
Much better than marrying for love.

58
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,534
We married for love.

59
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,287
And it's been wonderful.

60
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,543
Quantum physics makes me so happy.

61
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,420
Yeah? I'm glad.

62
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,839
It's like looking at the universe naked.

- Hi. Guys got a minute?
- Sure, what's up?

66
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,187
I was thinking about Sheldon's little joke
the other night...

67
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,649
- ...about me eating all your food.
- Oh, that was no joke.

68
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,904
But I understand your confusion
as I am our group's resident cutup.

69
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,574
I'm sorry, you are our resident cutup?

70
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,910
Yes.

71
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,955
- Prove it.
- Knock-knock.

72
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,623
- Who's there?
- Interrupting physicist.

73
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,292
- Interrupting phys...
- Muon. Ha, ha.

74
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,173
Anyway, I got a little residual check
from my commercial.

75
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,344
And I thought, "How about I get the guys
a little thank-you to pay them back?"

76
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,055
So, Sheldon... Ta-da.

A vintage, mint-in-box 1975
Mego Star Trek Transporter...

79
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,022
...with real transporter action. Hot darn!

80
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,151
- Where did you get that?
- From Stuart at the comic-book store.

81
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,654
You went to the comic-book store
by yourself?

82
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,489
Yeah. It was fun.

83
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,076
I walked in and two different guys
got asthma attacks.

84
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,288
Felt pretty good.

85
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,790
Well, this calls for an expression
of gratitude.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,626
Ooh, am I about to get
a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?

87
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,962
No, not this time.
Then they wouldn't be special.

88
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,214
Click. Thanks, Penny.

89
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,925
You're welcome.

90
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,886
Don't worry, I didn't forget about you.

91
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,849
Leonard, I got you a label-maker.

92
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,482
Wow.

93
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,401
No, it's great.

94
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,446
- Also, uh, mint-in-box.
- Mm.

95
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:27,075
- And I got you a Transporter too!
- Awesome!

96
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,707
Look, it was actually designed
for my vintage Mr. Spock action figure.

97
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,917
Oh, that's great.
Open it and put him in there.

98
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,878
- Open it?
- No, good Lord, no.

99
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,172
Why? They're just toys.

100
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,341
- Collectibles.
- They're mint-in-box.

101
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,134
Can't we open one up and take a look?

102
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,178
- Aah!
- No, don't!

103
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,473
Once you open the box, it loses its value.

104
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,727
Yeah, yeah. My mom gave me
the same lecture about my virginity.

105
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,232
Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun
taking it out and playing with it.

106
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,529
You sure you want us here
when you meet this woman?

107
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,867
Oh, yes. In my culture, it's expected to
have a chaperone to oversee a first date.

108
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,204
I want to make a good impression.
No offense, but with you here...

109
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,581
...I look like I'm 6'2".

110
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,378
The nuns always chaperoned
the dances at my high school.

111
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,172
They used to make us leave room
between us for the Holy Spirit.

<font color="#808080">RAJESH</font>:
Hmm.

113
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,969

Except they leave room for a cow. Ha, ha.

114
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,889
Listen, I love your charming
racist humor.

115
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,934
But any chance you could not mock
my religion while she's here?

116
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:38,230
- You made fun of me for eating lox.
- Your people don't worship lox.

117
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,982
Clearly you've never been to brunch
with my cousins.

118
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,277
So arranged marriages,
the parents just decide...

119
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,821
...and then you get married?

120
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,741
Oh, no, no. I get a say in it. I'm sure
whoever shows up will be better company...

121
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,703
...than the threesome I've been having
with Aunt Jemima and Mrs. Butterworth.

122
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,457
Excuse me, are you Rajesh?

123
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,960
Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi.

- Uh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

Is someone there?

133
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,364
Down here. On your desk.

134
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,789
- Spock?
- I need to speak with you.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,293
Fascinating.

136
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,796
The only logical explanation
is that this is a dream.

137
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,549
It is not the only logical explanation.

138
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,926
For example,
you could be hallucinating...

139
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,598
...after being hit on the head by,
say, a coconut.

140
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,393
Was I hit on the head by a coconut?

141
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,022
I am not going to dignify that
with a response.

142
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,357
Now to the matter at hand.

143
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,319
You need to play with the Transporter toy.

144
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,988
- But it's mint-in-box.
- Yes.

145
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,491
And to open it would destroy its value.

146
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,035
But remember, like me...

147
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,037
...you also have a human half.

148
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,957
Well, I'm not going to dignify that
with a response.

149
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,335
Consider this.

150
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,838
- What is the purpose of a toy?
- To be played with.

151
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,674
Therefore, to not play with it would be...?

152
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,845
Illogical. Oh, damn it, Spock,
you're right.

153
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,264
I'll do it.

154

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,186
You have to wake up first.

156
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,271
Oh, of course.

Energize.

169
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,479
Aah.

170
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,816
Energize.

171
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,079
Don't be broken.

172
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,040
Oh. Please, don't be broken.

173
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,252
What did you make me do?

174
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,257
Okay, okay. Think.

175
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,473
It's only logical.

176
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,730
My goodness, that was delicious.

177
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:11,234
Well, I hope you saved room
for chocolate lava cake.

178
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,652
Impressive.

179
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,946
What goes into making something
like that?

180
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,949
Well, you start out by trying
to make chocolate soufflé.

181
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,659
And when it falls, you panic...

182
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,370
...quickly change the name,
and voilà, lava cake.

183
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,833
I bet our parents are dying to know
how things are going here.

184
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,502
Well, let's see.

185
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,005
Yep, three missed calls.

186
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,133
Four missed calls, two text messages,
and a failed video chat.

187
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,469
- I win.
- Ha, ha.

188
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,221
So, what are we going to tell them?

189
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,975
- I'd like to tell them things are going well.
- Me too.

190
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,810
But before we get their hopes up...

191
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,855
...we should probably make sure
we're on the same page.

192
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,357
Okay.

193
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,859
What page are you on?

194
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,655
I'm on the one where I'm under
a lot of pressure from my parents...

195
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,574
...to get married and settle down
and have a family.

196
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,119
And I'm going to do it
so they don't find out I'm gay.

197
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,332
Say again?

198
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,708
I'm gay.

199
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,669
Like...

200
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,588
Dude-on-dude, but with women?

201
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,841
I know a fake marriage
isn't an honest way to live...

202
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,512
...but you, of all people, should know
how difficult it is to come out.

203
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,348
Why me "of all people"?

204
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,184
Well, there's a rumor
back in New Delhi that you're...

205
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,519
How shall we say?

206
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,896
...comfortable in a sari.

207
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,024
- I'm not gay.
- Really?

208
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,985
The chocolate lava cake,
the little soaps in the bathroom.

209
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,030
And I'm sorry, but you're wearing
more perfume than I am.

210
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,492
That's Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar.

211
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,079
And for your information, it's unisex.

212

213
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,085

- Got you.

214
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,672
With women. I like to boogie with women.

215
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,260
That's disappointing. You were exactly
the kind of phony-baloney husband...

216
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,928
...I was looking for.

217
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,972
Thank you.

218
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,267
And once again, my baloney likes girls.

219
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,147
Wait, wait. You don't wanna put
a bite of that in your mouth...

220
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,483
...without trying
my homemade Chantilly cream.

221
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,111
Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.

Two suns and no sunscreen.

225
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,637
Hello again, Sheldon.

226
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,266
What is it now, Tiny Spock?

227
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,393
I am very disappointed in you.

228
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,062
You broke your toy
and switched it with Leonard's.

229
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,398
You should be ashamed of yourself.

230
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,609
You're the one who told me
to play with it.

231
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,946
If I told you to jump off the bridge
of the Enterprise, would you do it?

232
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,198
No.

233
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,452
If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise,
I would never ever leave.

234
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,331
Trust me, it gets old after a while.

235
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,959
You must right your wrong, Sheldon.

236
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,670
Why? I got away with it.

237
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,799
Leonard has his toy,
and he's never going to open it.

238
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,511
So he won't know it's broken.
And I have a toy that isn't broken.

239
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,970
Everybody's happy.

240
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,764
Well, I am unhappy.

241
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,725
I thought where you come from
they don't have emotions.

242
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,021
I come from a factory in Taiwan.

243
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,690
Now, do the right thing.

244
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,526
You know what you are?

245
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,654
Well, you're a green-blooded buzzkill.

246
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,948
Perhaps it's time you beam on
out of here.

247
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,034
Fine. I will just use the Transporter.

248
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,746
Oh, right, you broke it.

249
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,710
Very well. Cooper to Enterprise,
one to beam up.

250
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,045

- Ready for lunch?
- Yeah, one sec. Ahh.

255
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,406
Oh, good. Ma would've killed me
if she found out I broke my retainer.

256
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,870
Hey, uh, can I run something by you?
It's about Lakshmi.

257
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,205
Yeah, sure. How are things going?

258
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,582
We hit a couple of bumps.

259
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,544
She lives over in Manhattan Beach,
so it takes like an hour to get there.

260
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,462
And she's a lesbian.

261
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,549
What do you mean, a lesbian?

262
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,052
Well, you know whenever you and I
would try to hit on women in bars...

263
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,264
...they'd blow us off,
then we'd tell each other they were gay?

264
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,807
It's like that.

265
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,310
Except this time, it's true.

266
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,772
- Why did she even go out with you?
- She was looking for a husband...

267
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,774
...so she can appear to be straight.

268
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,361
And, you know,
it sounded crazy to me at first...

269
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,323
...but I'm actually thinking about doing it.

270
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:14,245
Okay. Well, so the reason that might
sound crazy is because it's crazy!

271
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,748
Look, Howard, you're in a relationship.

272
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,666
You know you have to make
compromises.

273
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,128
Yes, but my compromises
are about which bedspread to buy...

274
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,757
...or whose turn it is to do the laundry,
Bernadette's or my mom's.

275
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,847
It's a great deal.
We both get our parents off our backs.

276
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,475
I don't have to come home
to an empty apartment.

277
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:40,855
Plus, once I'm married, I can finally eat
carbs again and let myself go.

278
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,568
Why don't you tell your parents
you wanna try to find someone else?

279
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,571
You know, one who hasn't slept
with more women than you.

280
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,699
Because this one wants to marry me.

281
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,202
I might never find another one who does.

282
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,373
You're thinking about marrying someone
you're never gonna have sex with?

283
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,583
I can't believe your attitude.

284
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,045
I thought you were in favor
of gay people getting married.

to break Leonard's toy...

...which you probably did by shaking it.
She shook it, we all saw her.

because I wanted you to have fun with it.

302

and plausible explana...

Wait.

317
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,116
It was me.

318
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,326
I opened your toy...

319
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,830
...discovered it was broken,
and didn't tell you.

320
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,293
- Why would you open mine?
- I didn't. That was a lie.

321
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,130
I opened my own toy...

322
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,424
...and it was already broken,
so I switched them.

323
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,720
- Well, you should talk to Stuart.
- I can't, because that was a lie.

324
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:05,726
Yours was broken in an earthquake
and that's a lie.

325
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,689
What is the truth?

326
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,026
My Mr. Spock doll came to me
in a dream and forced me to open it.

327
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:18,281
And when the toy broke,
I switched it for yours.

328
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,659
Later, he encouraged me to do
the right thing and I defied him.

329
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,745
And then I was attacked by a Gorn.

330
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,877
- Okay, that I believe.
- Mm.

331
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,171
Leonard, Penny,
I want you both to know...

332
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,675
...that I regret my actions
towards the two of you. That's a lie.

333
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,261
So is that one mine?

334
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,347
- Yes.
- Well, hand it over so I can open it.

335
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,391
Okay.

336
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,269
And, Leonard,
even though I don't have one anymore...

337
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,063
- ...I hope you have fun playing with it.
- That's a lie?

338
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,732
- A big, fat whopper.
- Yeah.

339
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,694
I hope it breaks.

340
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,119
This is a treat. What brings you guys by?

341
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,414
Raj, Howie told me what's going on
with you and Lakshmi.

342
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,210
- You told her?
- I told everybody.

343
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,964
We believe there's someone out there
who'll love you for you.

344
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,592
We kind of agreed to disagree
on that one.

345
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,012
But we both think
you shouldn't marry this woman.

346
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,890
So while I'm waiting
for this mysterious perfect match...

347
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,352
...who may or may not exist,
I'm supposed to just be alone?

348
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,020
Not necessarily.

349
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,566
I think we found someone for you
to cuddle with.

350
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,817

351
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,611

Oh, my goodness.

352
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,615
Aren't you the cutest little Yorkie ever?

353
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,410
- You got him for me?
- Her.

354
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,205
We thought you two would hit it off.

355
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,917
I think we already have.
Thank you guys so much.

356
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,295
Let's go see if you fit in my man-purse.

357
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,926
Metrosexual, my ass.
