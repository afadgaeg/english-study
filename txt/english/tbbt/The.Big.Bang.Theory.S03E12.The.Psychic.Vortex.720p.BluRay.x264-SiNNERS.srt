1
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,998
Look at us, getting ready
for a double date with actual women...

2
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,508
...who publicly acknowledge
they're our girlfriends.

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,170
Yes. I mean,
actual women are the best.

4
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,750
I don't understand.
What other kind of women are there?

5
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:22,582
Artificial women are your department.
You wanna take this?

6
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,692
No, it would just freak him out.

7
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,529
Listen, before we leave,
I should warn you...

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,187
...I'm a passionate man...

9
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,733
...and I tend towards
public displays of affection.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,230
What are you trying to tell me, Howard?

11
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,333
There might be making out
in the car or restaurant.

12
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,773
I don't want Bernadette
to feel uncomfortable...

13
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,073
...so it would help
if you and Penny made out too.

14
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,947
Don't worry, we're planning to have sex
right on the salad bar.

15
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,453
<i>Namaste, white people.</i>

16
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,553
Good news. I've rented us...

17
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,217
<i>- ...the four-hour edition of Watchmen.
- Got it.</i>

18
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,627
- Seen it.
- Detailed analysis posted online.

19
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,027
Then what are we gonna do tonight?

20
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:11,102
Sorry. Howard and I are going out
with Penny and Bernadette.

21
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,297
Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights
for me and Leonard.

22
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,068
These broncos have been saddled.

23
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,944
How did we get actual women?

24
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,818
Great. They get girlfriends
and they just abandon us?

25
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,785
It is great, isn't it?

26
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,489
We have a wonderful evening
ahead of us.

27
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,990
- We do?
- Oh, yes.

28
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,892
I discovered I don't have enough room
on my hard drive for a LINUX partition.

29
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,829
You and I are gonna perform
a full backup, reinitialize...

30
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,401
...and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

31
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,901
- I don't wanna do that.
- All right.

32
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,770
Well, I'm going to perform
a full backup, reinitialize...

33
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,673
...and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

34
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,609
Well, what about me?

35
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,740
Well, I understand there are
several types of artificial women.

36
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,178
Maybe you should look into that.

37
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,482
Dude, there are so many cool things
we could be doing tonight. Look.

38
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:36,053
At the Glendale Galleria:
"Put on your best zoot suit.

39
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,713
It's a salute to swing music...

40
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,382
...in the center court near Macy's,
5 p.m. to 9 p.m."

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,494
Huh? Huh?

42
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,722
A salute to zoot.

43
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,826
- Sounds like a hoot.
- I'm sorry, Raj.

44
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,993
I have no desire
to salute any article of clothing tonight...

45
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,833
...much less one that's linked
to race riots in the 1940s.

46
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,498
Race riots?

47
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,304
The Zoot Suit Riots.

48
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,847
Oh.

49
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,144
I always thought that was
some sort of after-Christmas sale.

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,086
Why don't we go to the galleria
and walk around?

51
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,748
I don't need anything at the galleria.
You need anything at the galleria?

52
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,690
No, we would just walk around
and see what's what.

53
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,094
That's a semantically null sentence.

54
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:24,101
Okay, well, how about this?
From the university website:

55
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,536
"Seven p.m. to 10 p.m.,
Norton Hall Multipurpose Room...

56
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,938
...mixer for grad students
and faculty...

57
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,442
...of the Science
and Humanities Departments.

58
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:37,549
Whether you split atoms or infinitives,
this is the place to be."

59
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,542
Well, that's certainly amusing...

60
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,855
...but I have no interest.

61
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,280
Come on, Sheldon.

62
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,949
The world is filled with people
doing things outside.

63
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,789
Let's go outside. Outside is good.

64
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,521
If outside is so good...

65
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,395
...why has mankind spent thousands
of years trying to perfect inside?

66
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,568
I don't know. It's a marketing scheme.

67
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,402
Please, Sheldon, I'm a young,
virile visitor from a foreign land...

68
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,909
...and I need to strut my stuff.

69
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,142
Let me offer you a compromise.

70
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:12,046
Sometimes when I feel stifled
and want a change of scenery...

71
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,813
...I use my imagination.

72
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,046
Oh, boy.

73
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:19,590
One of my favorite places to visit
is the two-dimensional world...

74
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,560
<i>...described in Edwin Abbott's
mathematical fantasy Flatland.</i>

75
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,162
I don't wanna go to Flatland.

76
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,496
You're only saying that
because you haven't been there.

77
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,831
I am now a hexagon
in two-dimensional space...

78
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,171
...and can only perceive the edges
of other objects.

79
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,901
Oy.

80
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,678
Is that you, Raj?
I don't recognize your edge.

81
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,781
Sheldon, I'm begging you.

82
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,922
I want to go to this mixer,
and I don't want to go alone.

83
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,823
Well, you're in luck.
There's a mixer here in Flatland.

84
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,588
Oh, look.

85
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,598
There's a sexually attractive
line segment.

86
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:02,928
- Chat her up.
- What?

87
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,039
Tell her you're a circle.
Flatland gals are all hot for circles.

88
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,036
I hope you're hungry.
We're going to a terrific restaurant.

89
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,148
Oh, yeah, I'm starved.
When you spend all day in a bio lab...

90
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,978
...watching flesh-eating bacteria
skeletonize rodents...

91
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,712
...it really works up an appetite.

92
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,719
Flesh-eating bacteria
and yet I still wanna kiss this woman.

93
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,052
What does that tell you?

94
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:32,130
You'd be willing to die a horrible death on
the off chance you'd get to second base.

95
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,291
We're way past second base.
Right, Howard?

96
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:40,169
Well, we kind of disagree
about what the bases are.

97
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,835
How's your work going, Penny?
Any acting jobs?

98
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,240
The last big thing I did
was this production...

99
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,143
<i>...of Diary of Anne Frank
above a bowling alley.</i>

100
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:52,183
But I think things
might be turning around pretty soon.

101
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,252
Well, great. How come?

102
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, promise you won't
make fun of me?

103
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,920
Of course.
I would never make fun of you.

104
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,362
Okay, well, I went to this psychic
who told me that if I cut my hair...

105
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,521
...I'm gonna get
a national commercial.

106
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,864
What? Seriously?

107
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,697
You're getting career advice
from a psychic?

108
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,273
Good job not making fun of her.

109
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:19,173
She's not one of those phonies, okay?
She wrote a book, has her own website.

110
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,836
Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?

111
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,608
They don't just let anyone
have a website.

112
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,018
- Why are you being such a jerk?
- You're surprised?

113
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,712
Your psychic didn't tell you
I was going to be a jerk?

114
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,952
Heh, heh. Bite me.

115
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,221
- Come on, Penny.
- Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?

116
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,023
We're gonna make out back here.

117
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,298
I'm sliding into third.

118
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,872
Thanks for coming with me.

119
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:53,410
Thanks for giving me your limited edition
Green Lantern lantern.

120
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,981
Did you really have to bring it
with you?

121
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,949
What if evil strikes
and my power ring runs low?

122
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,649
- Come on, let's get a drink.
- I don't drink.

123
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,883
Well, I do.

124
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,588
And when my wingman is carrying
a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot.

125
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,428
I'll have a screwdriver, please.
And don't be chintzy with the screw.

126
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,101
I would like a root-beerfloat.

127
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,775
- Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.
- They don't?

128
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:26,844
Well, apparently these people and I
differ greatly on the definition of "party."

129
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:31,678
- He'll have a Shirley Temple.
- And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.

130
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:39,282
- Okay, let's check out the females.
- All right.

131
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,357
There's a female.

132
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,190
That's Professor Wilkinson's wife.
She's like 80.

133
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,528
But she's female. Isn't that the game?

134
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,636
- No. I'm looking for a hookup.
- Oh, yes.

135
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:55,138
So the point of this exercise is for you
to find someone to copulate with?

136
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,971
Not so loud. But ideally, yes.

137
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,380
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

138
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,711
And what is my function as wingman?

139
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,382
- You help me run my game.
- Okay.

140
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,950
And what is your game?

141
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:16,156
When I lie through my teeth to a woman,
you nod and agree.

142
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,892
Hey, that's pretty cool. What is it?

143
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,899
It's a limited edition
Green Lantern lantern.

144
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,737
My friend is looking for someone
to copulate with.

145
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,574
You're very funny. I'm Abby.

146
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,472
- I'm Sheldon.
- How do you do?

147
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,239
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
Call me Raj.

148
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,907
- Hey, Raj. Where are you from?
- The mysterious subcontinent of India.

149
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,985
- Ooh. India.
- You know India?

150
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:46,421
<i>- I saw Slumdog Millionaire.
- Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.</i>

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,419
I thought your father
was a gynecologist.

152
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,861
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,193
Martha, come here.
Meet Raj and Sheldon.

154
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,599
- My friend Martha.
- Hi.

155
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:00,865
- Hello.
- Hello.

156
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,373
Is that the limited edition
Green Lantern lantern?

157
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:10,607
In brightest day, in darkest night,
no evil shall escape my sight.

158
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,514
Oh, that is so awesome.

159
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:16,780
Thank you.

160
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,187
Have you chosen one
to copulate with?

161
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:35,407
So, what should we talk about?

162
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,404
Well, we could always learn more...

163
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:42,240
...about why people who believe
in psychics are idiots. Leonard?

164
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,910
We don't need
to talk about that anymore.

165
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,079
Leonard covered it pretty well
in the car.

166
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,487
I'm sorry, but facts are facts.

167
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,823
Right, and if you can't understand it,
it's not a fact.

168
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,988
No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.

169
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,432
- Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.
- Oh, you're welcome.

170
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,596
- How's your fish?
- Amazing.

171
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,106
- Would you like to try some?
- Yeah, sure.

172
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,267
Well, the fact is you can't.

173
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,076
Howard, Bernadette,
you're both scientists.

174
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,408
Help me out here.

175
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,444
Wanna jump in the middle
of another couple's argument?

176
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,416
- No, thank you.
- Sorry.

177
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,789
Maybe we should just stop talking
about this.

178
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,792
Maybe some of us
should stop talking altogether.

179
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,925
- How is everything tonight?
- Really uncomfortable.

180
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,961
The best thing about a monogamous,
mutually supportive relationship...

181
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,131
...is even if you have different ideas...

182
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,768
...you can have a spirited debate,
yet still care for, even make love...

183
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,441
You want your fish?

184
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,885
Knew you were gonna do that.
Doesn't make me psychic.

185
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,620
Attaboy, Leonard. Make it worse.

186
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,524
<i>American woman</i>

187
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,361
<i>Listen what I say</i>

188
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,561
What's going on?

189
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,407
We scored.

190
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,668
I'm the wingman.

191
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,871
<i>American woman</i>

192
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,720
- Hey.
- Laser.

193
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,023
Had a great night last night.

194
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:38,324
I don't like to kiss and tell,
but somebody made it to eighth base.

195
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,196
- What the hell is eighth base?
- Seventh base with shirt off.

196
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,938
Well, my shirt.

197
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:53,004
- How'd things go with Penny?
- Oh, couldn't be better.

198
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,384
Are we taking
our relationship frustrations out...

199
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,213
...on innocent Cylons?

200
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,855
It's not just Cylons. Superman's next.

201
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,056
I was gonna try to squeeze in
a little more mocking before lunch...

202
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,563
...but I can come back when
you don't have a high-powered weapon.

203
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,692
How can I go out with a woman
who believes in psychics?

204
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,738
Hey, I once dated a girl who believed
she was abducted by aliens.

205
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,273
And that didn't bother you?

206
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:27,573
<i>Au contraire, it meant she was gullible
and open to a little probing.</i>

207
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,706
What am I supposed to do?

208
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,544
Pretend I believe something I don't
when I'm with Penny?

209
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:38,089
Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes
all kinds of things when she's with you.

210
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,985
Do me a favor.
Lean over, put your head right here.

211
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,223
Let me show you another way
to look at this.

212
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:49,095
Here we have the universe
of all women.

213
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,464
Okay, these are the ones
you wanna sleep with.

214
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,732
These are the women
who believe exactly what you believe.

215
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:58,434
These are the women
who would be willing to sleep with you.

216
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,309
And right there,
in the little triple intersection...

217
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,777
...is your ideal mate.

218
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,612
Odds are she's a short physicist
with low self-esteem...

219
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,949
...who lives in a government
research facility in China.

220
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,288
What's your point?

221
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,824
To keep having a sexual relationship
with Penny...

222
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,464
...I have to give up everything I believe in?
My intellectual integrity?

223
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,294
The very nature of who I am?
I can't do that, Howard.

224
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,129
I respect that.

225
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,131
- What is that?
- Your new girlfriend.

226
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,667
Have fun tonight.

227
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,809
"The dog."

228
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,611
"The roof."

229
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,317
"Grapes."

230
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,969
One minute.

231
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,507
- What was that?
- It means, "Come in."

232
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,976
It's taking forever to load the new
operating system on my computer.

233
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,172
I disinfected the kitchen
and the bathroom.

234
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,818
Now I thought I'd learn Finnish.

235
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,348
That's Hindi for,
"Whatever floats your boat."

236
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,720
Listen, I got a text
from that girl Abby...

237
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,363
...and she and Martha
wanna hang out with us again.

238
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,863
- What do you say?
- I don't say anything.

239
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:32,596
I merely offer you a facial expression
that suggests you've gone insane.

240
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,874
- I don't get it. You had a great time.
- Yes, exactly. I had a great time.

241
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,035
That's done.
I've moved on to other things.

242
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:44,240
For example, after I learn Finnish,
I'm not going to learn Finnish again.

243
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,884
Please, Sheldon.

244
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,418
I'm a lost Indian boy far from home...

245
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,249
...and I want a girlfriend,
and I want her to be Abby...

246
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,018
...and she'll only come
if she can bring Martha.

247
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,684
I highly doubt
there is any argument you can make...

248
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:00,890
...threat you might levy,
rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation...

249
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:06,095
<i>...supplication or "vetoomus"
that you can employ...</i>

250
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,070
...that would convince me
to reconsider.

251
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:26,755
My Incredible Hulk hands
signed by Stan Lee.

252
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:29,752
Oh, my.

253
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,582
I've admired these for years.

254
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,241
Does that mean
we can go out with the girls again?

255
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,185
Hulk agree to second date
with puny humans.

256
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,287
You can't wear the hands on the date.

257
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,765
Hulk sad.

258
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,268
Hey.

259
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,970
Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?

260
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,446
Not only is it courteous,
it's safety-smart.

261
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:26,483
Every year, 15,000 fires are caused
by accidental dryer-lint ignition.

262
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,479
And now you're supposed to say,
"Wow, what an interesting fact.

263
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,615
Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy.
I could never be mad at you."

264
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,297
Wow. That's all you got after you were
the most obnoxious person...

265
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,957
...on a double date
that included Howard Wolowitz?

266
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,904
No, I'm sorry. I really am.

267
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:50,338
It's not right
to mock what a person believes in.

268
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,171
Thank you.

269
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,007
You willing to go to my psychic
and see what it's about?

270
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,648
You willing to read a book...

271
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,512
...that concisely explains
how all psychics are frauds?

272
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,750
I would not.

273
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,690
- Okay, let's go see your psychic.
- Really?

274
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,195
Well, yeah.
One of us has to keep an open mind.

275
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:17,393
- Saying I don't have an open mind?
- No. Let me help you with this stuff.

276
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,065
You know, I believe in ghosts too.

277
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,831
- Great.
- And astrology.

278
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:25,842
I know.
And pyramid power and healing crystals.

279
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,345
Oh, no, no, no. Crystals don't work.

280
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,209
Really? That's the line?

281
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,013
Psychics are real,
but crystals are voodoo?

282
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,714
Oh, voodoo's real.
You don't wanna mess with voodoo.

283
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,752
<i>Flatland is more
than just a mathematical essay.</i>

284
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,024
It is also a treatise
on Victorian social mores.

285
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,566
You know,
I had never considered that.

286
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:57,069
Wow. I mean, that's going
to completely change my visits there.

287
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,452
- Well, it's late.
- Uh-huh.

288
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,055
Time for bed.

289
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,756
Okay.

290
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,589
Good night, puny human.

291
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:29,932
Sheldon?

292
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,313
Yes?

293
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,284
Listen, they're kind of getting busy
in the living room...

294
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,947
...and I was wondering
if I could hang out in here for a while.

295
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,122
Well, I suppose. Come in.

296
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,636
I'll sleep in Leonard's room.
Good night.
