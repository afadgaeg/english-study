1
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:16,031
Problem?

2
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,809
- This is Thai food.
- Here we go.

3
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:23,587
We don't have Thai food on Thursday.
We have pizza on Thursday.

4
00:00:23,717 --> 00:00:25,850
{pos(192,200)}Yes, but we all agreed
that the third Thursday

5
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:28,491
{pos(192,200)}of every month would be
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

6
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,901
Apparently the news didn't
reach my digestive system,

7
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:32,937
which, when startled,
has it's own version

8
00:00:33,062 --> 00:00:35,032
of Anything Can Happen Thursday.

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,977
{pos(192,220)}Come on, the whole idea behind
Anything Can Happen Thursday

10
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:41,452
is to get out of this rut
we've been in lately.

11
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:44,039
{pos(192,220)}"Rut"?
I think you mean "consistency."

12
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:46,972
And if we're going to abandon that,
then why even call it Thursday?

13
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:51,077
{pos(192,220)}Let's call it "Quonko Day" and divide it
into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece,

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,005
{pos(192,220)}and celebrate it by sacrificing
a goat to the mighty god Ra.

15
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,242
I could go for some goat.

16
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:04,605
Sheldon, we agreed
we'd do something different tonight.

17
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:07,817
All right.
Let's go to the comic book store.

18
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:09,485
We went there last night.

19
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,146
Last night was Wednesday.
Wednesday is comic book night.

20
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,573
Tonight, we'll be going on Thursday,

21
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,179
because it's
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

22
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,813
Way to think outside
but pressed right up against the box.

23
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:24,633
So what are we going to do tonight?

24
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:26,508
If I may proffer a suggestion,

25
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:29,131
in bars all across
this great nation of ours,

26
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,407
Thursday night is Ladies' Night.

27
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,908
Which means,
as the evening progresses,

28
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:36,659
we will get better looking
courtesy of 99 cent margaritas

29
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:38,662
and two-for-one Jell-O shots.

30
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:42,685
Come on, Howard, the odds of us

31
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:45,228
picking up girls in a bar
are practically zero.

32
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,690
Really? Are you familiar
with the Drake Equation?

33
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,634
The one that estimates
the odds of making contact

34
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,254
with extraterrestrials
by calculating the product

35
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,378
of an increasingly restrictive
series of fractional values

36
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:54,872
such as those stars with planets,

37
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:56,704
and those planets
likely to develop life?

38
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:58,765
N equals R times FP
times NE times FL

39
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,676
times FI times FC times L?

40
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:05,764
Yeah, that one.

41
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:13,839
You can modify it
to calculate our chances

42
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:16,385
of having sex by changing
the formula to use the number

43
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:18,045
of single women in Los Angeles,

44
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,427
the number of those who might
find us attractive,

45
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:23,140
and what I call
the Wolowitz Coefficient.

46
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,644
"The Wolowitz Coefficient"?

47
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,112
Neediness times dress size squared.

48
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:32,310
Crunching the numbers,
I come up with a conservative

49
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:35,905
5,812 potential sex partners
within a 40-mile radius.

50
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:37,573
You're joking.

51
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:40,748
I'm a horny engineer, Leonard.

52
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,694
I never joke about math or sex.

53
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,704
What are we waiting for?
Let's bounce, bitches.

54
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:51,629
You're right.

55
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,481
It's Anything Can Happen Thursday.
Let's hit the clubs and meet hot women!

56
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,473
Here we go.
Lock up your daughters!

57
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:59,720
We're going to hit it and quit it.

58
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:09,063
Or we could finish eating
and go to the comic book store.

59
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:11,129
Also a good plan.

60
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:14,944
But next Anything Can Happen Thursday,
we're definitely going to a bar.

61
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:16,254
Absolutely.

62
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,122
You heard that, Ladies' Night ladies?
We're eventually coming for you!

63
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,871
Fascinating.

64
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:48,811
Subtitles: The FW Team

65
00:03:51,138 --> 00:03:53,641
- Hey, guys. Where're you headed?
- To the comic book store.

66
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,755
{pos(192,220)}You're probably thinking,
"The comic book store? On a Thursday?

67
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,180
{pos(192,220)}Why, I've fallen down the rabbit hole
and into a land of madness."

68
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,203
{pos(192,220)}What you have failed
to take into account,

69
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:05,039
{pos(192,220)}is that this is
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

70
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:07,801
You got me.

71
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:11,333
While you're there, could pick me up
a few comics for my nephew's birthday?

72
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:13,689
{pos(192,200)}I think you mean comic books.

73
00:04:13,814 --> 00:04:17,005
{pos(192,200)}"Comics" are feeble attempts at humor
featuring talking babies

74
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,688
{pos(192,200)}and anthropomorphized pets

75
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:22,401
{pos(192,200)}found traditionally in the
optimistically-named "funny pages."

76
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,479
{pos(192,200)}Could you pick me up a few comics
for my nephew's birthday?

77
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:27,929
Sure. What does he like?

78
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:30,186
I don't know, he's 13.
Just pick out anything.

79
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,104
"Just pick out anything"?

80
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:36,486
{pos(192,200)}Maybe {t the same time}we can pick out a new suit
for him without knowing his size.

81
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:39,111
{pos(192,200)}Or pick out his career for him
without knowing his aptitude.

82
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,078
{pos(192,200)}Or pick out a new breakfast cereal
without knowing his fiber requirements.

83
00:04:43,924 --> 00:04:46,463
{pos(192,200)}Or his feelings
about little marshmallows.

84
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:51,416
{pos(192,200)}- Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
- <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i>,

85
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,585
{pos(192,200)}<i>Ultimate Spider-Man,
Spectacular Spider-Man,</i>

86
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,004
<i>The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man,
Spider-Man 2099</i>?

87
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:02,092
{pos(192,200)}You know this can go on all night.
Why don't you just come with us?

88
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:05,435
That's what I was trying to avoid.

89
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:08,692
I forgot <i>Sensational Spider-Man</i>.

90
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:15,105
What a cute, little store.

91
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:20,746
Everybody's staring at me.

92
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:25,699
{pos(192,200)}Don't worry, they're more scared of you
than you are of them.

93
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,951
Unlikely.

94
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:33,208
Here, what about this one
for my nephew?

95
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,376
- A superb choice.
- Oh, great.

96
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:38,895
{pos(192,200)}Provided he has already read
<i>Infinite Crisis</i> and <i>52</i>,

97
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,258
{pos(192,200)}and is familiar with the
reestablishment of the DC multiverse.

98
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,344
What's a "multiverse"?

99
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,510
{pos(192,200)}Get her out of here.

100
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,225
Come on, I'll help you
pick something.

101
00:05:52,697 --> 00:05:54,542
That's right. She's with us.

102
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:59,272
Guys like that are so pathetic.

103
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:01,766
Tell me about it.

104
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:04,864
Look, a new Batman belt buckle.

105
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,869
Hey, Leonard.
Can I help you find something?

106
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,454
Hey, Stuart. This is Penny.
She's looking for some comic books.

107
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:13,623
Oh, really.

108
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:16,668
Blink twice if you're here
against your will.

109
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:19,743
I think we're fine, Stuart.

110
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:22,618
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thanks.

111
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:25,884
He seems like a nice guy.

112
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:28,971
You mean for someone
who's into comic books?

113
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,113
I just meant for... yeah.

114
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:36,895
Just because people appreciate
comic books doesn't make them weirdos.

115
00:06:37,235 --> 00:06:38,646
Stuart's a terrific artist.

116
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,816
He went to the Rhode Island
School of Design.

117
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:42,554
What about the guy over there

118
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:45,070
in the superhero T-shirt
tucked into his sweatpants?

119
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,991
Yeah, that's Captain Sweatpants.

120
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:55,244
He doesn't really help
the point I'm trying to make.

121
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:58,772
- Got it. Got it.
- Got it. Got it.

122
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:11,271
Need it!

123
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,100
Let it go.

124
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:16,894
Why? I saw it first.

125
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,439
- Yes, but I saw it from the front.
- A far less impressive feat.

126
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:23,489
Come on! I need this
for my Batman collection.

127
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:26,612
- I need it for my Robin collection.
- Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?

128
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,903
Why would I gamble?
It's mine. Let go.

129
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:30,393
- You let go.
- No, you!

130
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:31,396
Problem?

131
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:34,119
- He won't let go of my comic book.
- It's my comic book!

132
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,537
We need a ruling.

133
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,206
Cut it in half?

134
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:41,210
- Excuse me.
- Hello again.

135
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:44,630
Hi. What would you recommend
as a present for a 13-year-old boy?

136
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,090
A 13-year-old girl.

137
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,613
But if you're dead set
on a comic book, try...

138
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:53,472
this.

139
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:55,891
<i>Hellblazer</i>.
What's this about?

140
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,990
A morally ambiguous confidence man

141
00:07:58,171 --> 00:07:59,836
who smokes, has lung cancer

142
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,580
and is tormented
by the spirits of the undead.

143
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,568
If it doesn't make me the favorite aunt,
I don't know what will.

144
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,197
Is this me?

145
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:14,406
Depends. Do you like it?

146
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:17,371
- It's really good.
- Yes, that's you.

147
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:21,874
That's so sweet,
but what if I didn't like it?

148
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:24,577
It'd still be you,
but I'd feel like an idiot.

149
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:29,758
I don't believe it.
Stuart's putting the moves on Penny.

150
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:32,761
I have got to learn how to draw.

151
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:38,874
Once again, defeated
by your own prurient interests.

152
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:42,949
Guys, have you seen Stuart
all up in Penny's business over there?

153
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:46,804
Nobody's up in anybody's business.
Let's just buy our stuff and go.

154
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,278
Okay, you've got my number.

155
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,197
- Now, give me the picture.
- You drive a hard bargain.

156
00:08:53,078 --> 00:08:54,324
But here.

157
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:57,452
All right.
So, just give me a call.

158
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:04,102
So, Leonard, how are you enjoying
Anything Can Happen Thursday?

159
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,327
Look at that.
That's a dent.

160
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,940
Thank you,
Howard "Ham-Fisted" Wolowitz.

161
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:22,132
Did you just shut the TV off
in the middle of the classic

162
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:24,563
Deep Space Nine/Star Trek:
The Original Series

163
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:27,024
"Trouble With Tribbles"
crossover episode?

164
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:29,833
Apparently so.

165
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:32,606
Are you ill?

166
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:36,441
All right.

167
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:39,124
Then is it fair to say
that you're experiencing

168
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:41,434
some sort of emotional turmoil
over the events

169
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,686
involving Penny
earlier this evening?

170
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:45,761
When did you pick up on that?

171
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:49,497
A moment ago, when you turned off the TV
{in the middle of }during the classic

172
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,478
<i>Deep Space Nine/Star Trek:
The Original Series</i>

173
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,509
"Trouble With Tribbles"
crossover episode.

174
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,389
Would you like some advice?

175
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:01,517
Sure, why not?

176
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:04,242
Then, this is the perfect
time to launch a blog

177
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:06,786
with an interactive
comments section.

178
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:09,524
Thanks a lot.

179
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,778
Would you rather I offer
my personal insight?

180
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,959
I don't need any insights.

181
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:18,399
I just want to know why Penny's
more interested in Stuart than me.

182
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:20,463
We're practically the same guy.

183
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,417
I disagree.

184
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:25,541
Stuart is taller,
artistic, self-employed

185
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:29,704
and, most significantly,
he gets 45 percent off comic books.

186
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,282
You're right. I really should be
asking strangers on the Internet.

187
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:41,295
My original point.

188
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:47,305
Chinese food, vintage video games...

189
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:50,213
After the nightmare of
Anything Can Happen Thursday,

190
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:53,262
this is Friday night
the way it was meant to be.

191
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:56,363
Who's up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?

192
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:02,911
Hey, Penny...
and Stuart.

193
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:07,833
- Hey, guys.
- So what are you kids up to?

194
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:10,586
Stuart has a piece in an art show
that's opening tonight.

195
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,797
And you guys are going together.
Great...

196
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,379
It is great.

197
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:16,653
Really great.

198
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:18,128
Freaking awesome.

199
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:21,183
- What are you guys doing?
- It's Friday night,

200
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:23,265
Chinese food and vintage
video games, right?

201
00:11:23,592 --> 00:11:26,517
Vintage doesn't even begin
to describe what we have planned.

202
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:30,578
Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980
interactive text adventure, Zork.

203
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:34,178
It's the buggy beta version.

204
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,653
Zork. Well, you guys have fun.

205
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:40,955
- See you guys.
- See you, Stuart.

206
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:42,465
Hey, Howard?

207
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:45,929
Take me to a bar with women.

208
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,206
- Really?
- Yeah.

209
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:55,306
Let me just go inside
and slip off my underwear.

210
00:11:58,885 --> 00:11:59,718
Why?

211
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:04,100
Well, if I get lucky, I don't want
to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.

212
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,391
Do you...? Let's go.

213
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,579
May I have a grasshopper
with a little umbrella, please?

214
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,112
- No, he may not.
- Why?

215
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:21,010
{pos(192,220)}I'm not sitting here with a guy

216
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:23,772
{pos(192,220)}drinking a grasshopper
with a little umbrella.

217
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:27,621
{pos(192,220)}Fine. I'll have a chocolate martini.

218
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:30,332
Wrong again!

219
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:32,468
{Come on, }You know I can't talk to women

220
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:35,488
unless I'm lit up
like the Hindu festival of Devali.

221
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:42,005
{Look, }There are plenty
of bars in Los Angeles

222
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,282
where you can order grasshoppers
and chocolate martinis,

223
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:47,977
but you wouldn't have to
because there are no women in them.

224
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:50,005
Gotcha.

225
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,522
I'll have a Brandy Alexander.

226
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:58,222
All right, the Three Musketeers
just became the Dynamic Duo.

227
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,310
Should we talk
to some of these women?

228
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:03,323
It's way too early
in the night for that.

229
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:07,600
{See, }First we let the lawyers and the jocks
thin the herd, and then...

230
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:10,250
we go after the weak
and the old and the lame.

231
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,378
That's your system?

232
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:14,853
That's my system.

233
00:13:16,757 --> 00:13:19,381
And if you spot a chick
with a Seeing Eye dog, she's mine.

234
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,569
Come on. I think it's nice

235
00:13:25,694 --> 00:13:28,825
that Captain Sweatpants
showed up to your art opening.

236
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:33,145
Yeah, it would have been nicer
if he hadn't touched all the cheese.

237
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,757
You know, it's kind of early.

238
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:39,901
Do you want to maybe come in
for some coffee{ or something}?

239
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,238
Gee, it's a little late
for coffee, isn't it?

240
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:47,826
You think "coffee," means coffee.
That is so sweet.

241
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:50,954
Come on. I think I have decaf.

242
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:52,706
Good, Stuart.

243
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:55,543
I thought I heard your voice.
Do you have a moment?

244
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,378
- Yeah, I guess.
- Sheldon, we're a little busy{ here}, so...

245
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:01,209
- What are you doing?
- We're having coffee.

246
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,842
Isn't it a little late for coffee?

247
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:06,553
It's okay. She thinks she has decaf.

248
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:13,502
I'll just go look for it.

249
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,848
- What's up?
- I've spent the last three hours

250
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:19,512
in an online debate
in the DC Comics Batman chatroom,

251
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:23,072
- and I need your help.
- Yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn.

252
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,928
- What's the topic?
- I am asserting,

253
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:27,206
in the event
that Batman's death proves permanent,

254
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,261
the original Robin, Dick Grayson,

255
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:31,285
is the logical successor
to the Bat Cowl.

256
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,831
Sheldon, I'm afraid
you couldn't be more wrong.

257
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:40,957
More wrong?

258
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,865
Wrong is an absolute state
and not subject to gradation.

259
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,826
Of course it is. It's a little wrong
to say a tomato is a vegetable.

260
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:54,612
It's very wrong to say
it's a suspension bridge.

261
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:59,856
But returning to the original issue,
Dick Grayson became Nightwing,

262
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,441
a superhero in his own right.

263
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:04,319
Batman 2 has to be
the second Robin, Jason Todd.

264
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,237
Has to be? Has to be?

265
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:10,867
I hope you're being
deliberately provocative.

266
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,939
- I found the decaf!
- Great!

267
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:15,938
Herbal tea for me, please.

268
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:20,764
Barkeep!

269
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:22,340
Alexander me.

270
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,579
How about those two?

271
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,889
They're eating peanuts.

272
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:31,584
And my allergies, one kiss would put me
in Cedars-Sinai for a week.

273
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:36,270
What about the ones in the corner?

274
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:39,145
Possible. Very possible.

275
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:43,253
{Do }You want the one in the whiplash collar
or the one who keeps blinking?

276
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:45,678
I think Blinky's cute.

277
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,190
You got it, sir.

278
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:49,442
Wait, so we just go over there?

279
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:52,142
We have a little prep work to do.

280
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:55,454
Put this in your mouth.
We walk past them, you stumble a bit.

281
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,682
I say, sorry,
my friend's had a little too much.

282
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:00,703
And then I start
to pull it out of your mouth.

283
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:03,407
And say, "A little too much fun."

284
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,214
Get it?

285
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,395
{I mean, }They're laughing, we're laughing.

286
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,894
Then we get them up
to about a .15 blood alcohol level,

287
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,679
and tell them we're millionaires.

288
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:16,295
What else you got?

289
00:16:16,831 --> 00:16:18,539
Depends. Are you
willing to sit on my lap

290
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:20,729
and pretend to be
a ventriloquist dummy?

291
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:25,429
I can't sit on your lap.
You don't know the routine.

292
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:32,249
I'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck
in a pre-<i>Zero Hour</i> DC universe.

293
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:33,450
Of course I am.

294
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,007
Removing Joe Chill as the killer
of Batman's parents

295
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:38,330
effectively deprived him
of his <i>raison d'�tre</i>.

296
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:42,709
{Okay. You can }Throw all the French around you want,
it doesn't make you right.

297
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:44,484
<i>Au contraire.</i>

298
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,173
Plus, you're forgetting
that the <i>Infinite Crisis</i> storyline

299
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,522
restored Joe Chill
to the Batman mythology.

300
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,054
I am forgetting nothing
and I resent your tone.

301
00:16:57,044 --> 00:16:59,517
Look, Sheldon, it's late.
I've got to get some sleep.

302
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,937
- So, I win.
- No, I'm tired.

303
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:04,215
So, I win.

304
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:08,272
- Fine. You win.
- Darn tootin', I win.

305
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:12,058
Penny, I really had
a terrific time...

306
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:16,576
No, don't wake her.

307
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:19,582
She'll maul you
like a rabid wolverine.

308
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:25,185
You know, I don't think
that was decaf.

309
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,581
Wait. Is this your card or isn't it?

310
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,263
Trust me. This was their card.

311
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:39,099
I thought you were good at this.

312
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:42,352
You're always talking about
how you go to bars and meet women.

313
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:44,288
I do, all the time.

314
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,903
Well, what happened?
We've been sitting here all night

315
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:50,587
and the longest conversation you've had
with a woman was when your mom called.

316
00:17:56,713 --> 00:17:58,868
You're just going to make me
come out and say it{, aren't you}?

317
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:00,453
Say what?

318
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,540
You're weighing me down.

319
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:08,461
I'm a falcon who hunts better solo.

320
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:13,007
Fine. I'll sit here.
You take flight and hunt.

321
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:17,178
Don't be ridiculous.
You can't {just }tell a falcon when to hunt.

322
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:19,429
Actually, you can.

323
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,977
There's a whole sport
built around it.

324
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:26,632
Falconry.

325
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:31,217
Shut up.

326
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:34,387
Let's just get Koothrappali and go.

327
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:41,978
Lucky bastard.

328
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:46,999
It's got to be
that stupid accent of his.

329
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:53,006
Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz
from Bombay.

330
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:57,432
Okay, I'm stumped.
