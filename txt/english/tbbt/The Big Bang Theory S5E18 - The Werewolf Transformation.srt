1
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:07,214
I'm gonna run to the store.
I'll pick you up when you're done.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,968
Okay. I like it a little better
when you stay, but all right.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,803
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hello.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,347
I'm here for my haircut
with Mr. D'Onofrio.

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,517
I'm sorry, Uncle Tony is in the hospital.
He's pretty sick.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,396
Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's
in the hospital.

7
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,691
Why do these things
always happen to me?

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,610
- I can cut it for you.
- You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,739
I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio.

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,991
You believe this guy?

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,285
Excuse us for a second.

12
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,871
Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it.
He's a barber.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,707
He's not a barber, he's the nephew.

14
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,043
An example of the nepotism...

15
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,503
...that runs rampant
in the barbering industry.

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,299
Besides Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly
how I like my hair done...

17
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,886
...because he has all my haircut records
from my barber in Texas.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,013
What are you talking about?

19
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,475
When I first moved here, I was nervous
about finding a new barber...

20
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:03,395
...so my mother had all my haircut
records sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,025
There's no such thing
as haircut records.

22
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,112
- Yes, there are.
- Have you ever seen them?

23
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,740
No, but my mother assured me
they were sent here...

24
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:18,619
...and I'll bet you dollars to donuts
that this one doesn't have them.

25
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,953
Excuse me.

26
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,498
Do you have access
to my haircut records?

27
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,083
Your what?

28
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,377
To paraphrase T.S. Eliot,
this is the way the world ends.

29
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,672
Not with a bang but with a nephew.

30
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,635
Sheldon, you're a grown man,
he's a professional...

31
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,639
...and your haircut is number three
on that poster from 1946.

32
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,101
- Just sit down and let him do it.
- Fine.

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,896
But if I come out of this
looking like a dork, it's on you.

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,406
- So my kid said the funniest thing today.
- Nope.

35
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,542
When you tell this story later,
the word we usually use is "quirky."

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,237
- Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
- Sure.

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,364
<font color="#E86CE4">(BLOWING)</font>

38
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,874
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.

39
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,878
Sheldon, you are one day late
for your haircut.

40
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,380
Thank you
for captioning my nightmare.

41
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,927
- Lookie here, I got my travel orders.
- Hmm.

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,347
"Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz
is requested to report...

43
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,559
...to the NASA Johnson Space Center,
Houston, Texas...

44
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,769
...for astronaut training
Monday 8 a.m."

45
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,898
Yeah, but it's from NASA,
so it's 0800.

46
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,274
But it says 8 a.m.

47
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:18,238
- You read it as 0800.
- Lt doesn't have an O in front of it.

48
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,991
It does have an O in front of it.

49
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,703
Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut,
and you're dying of jealousy.

50
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:29,416
So, what kind of things are they...?
Will you stop that?

51
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,921
I can't help it,
I feel like a teen heartthrob.

52
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,592
Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair.
I could do it.

53
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:44,431
Penny, I know you mean well,
offering the skills of the hill folk...

54
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,018
...but here in town,
we don't churn our own butter...

55
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,354
...we don't make dresses
out of gunny sacks...

56
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,815
...and we sure as shooting
don't get our hair cut by bottle-blond...

57
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,734
Sheldon, be nice.

58
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,656
I'm sorry, it's the bad-boy attitude
that comes with this hair.

59
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,370
You could go to my guy.
He's at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills.

60
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,830
They bring you a cup of tea,
massage your scalp.

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,500
It's $200 but sometimes
you look in the next chair...

62
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,711
...and you see a superstar
like Tony Danza.

63
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,258
Quick question here, have we actually
changed the conversation...

64
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,220
...from "I'm going to astronaut training"
to "Sheldon can't get a haircut"?

65
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:27,557
Now who's dying of jealousy?
"Oh," it's you.

I'm a cowboy

67
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,400
On a steel horse
I ride

68
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:43,907
I'm wanted

69
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,913
Wanted
Dead or alive

70
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:54,042
Sheldon, you're ruining
girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.

71
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,422
I'm sorry. I'm looking for a barber
and I'm running out of time.

72
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,673
My hair is growing...

73
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,510
...at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers
per femtosecond.

74
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,347
If you're quiet, you can hear it.

75
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,101
- What about Supercuts?
- No, I tried once.

76
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,938
They do men's and women's hair
in the same room at the same time.

77
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,899
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah
with mousse.

78
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,904
Well, this isn't a crisis. Why don't
you just let your hair grow out a little?

79
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,240
Why don't I let my hair grow out?

80
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,367
Why don't I start wearing
Birkenstocks...

81
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,997
...and seeking validation of my opinions
by asking, "Can you dig it?"

82
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,668
I don't know. I think
you might look sexy with long hair.

83
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,840
With the kind
that flows down to your shoulders...

84
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,134
...and blows back
while riding on a horse.

85
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,514
Bareback and bare-chested.

86
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,852
I'm gonna go brush my teeth,
it might take a while.

87
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,777
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

88
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,446
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

89
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,948
So tell me all about your first day.

90
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:12,788
Oh, wow, where do I even start?
I got to experience zero gravity.

91
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,040
- Cool. How do they do that?
- Lt's pretty neat.

92
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:20,379
You get in this plane that goes
almost straight up for like 20 seconds...

93
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:24,966
...and then straight back down
like it's gonna crash...

94
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:30,430
...and they do it over and over again,
no matter how many times you throw up.

95
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,559
- You threw up?
- Yeah. And the craziest part is...

96
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:39,856
...because there's no gravity,
the throw-up kind of floats there.

97
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,945
In a little ball,
and if your mouth is open...

98
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,406
...because you're screaming...

99
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,786
...sometimes it just floats right back in.

100
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,041
Boy, does everyone laugh at you
when that happens.

101
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,043
- That sounds mean.
- No.

102
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,753
I would have laughed too...

103
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,797
...but I didn't want
the vomit to come back out.

Heh. Anyway...

106
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,679
Oh, could you do me a favor...

107
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:14,015
...and overnight me
some more underwear?

108
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,351
- Sure, why?
- I got a look at the centrifuge...

109
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,687
...they're gonna
spin me around in tomorrow...

110
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,190
...and I have a hunch
I packed a little light.

111
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,533
Mr. D'Onofrio?

112
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,118
It's me, Sheldon.

113
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,873
They didn't have anything
barber-themed in the gift shop...

114
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,083
...so I got you this.

115
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,713
Don't know if you can read his little
T-shirt. It says, "Get well beary soon."

116
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,676
Trust me, if you were even a little
conscious right now, you'd be laughing.

00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,477
There's new studies that show...

120
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,939
...people in comas are aware
of everything going on around them.

121
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,859
With that in mind, if you can hear me...

122
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:11,615
...move away from the light
and toward the sound of these scissors.

123
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,619
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

124
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,206
Do you have something
I could use as a cape?

125
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,585
Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills,
slip out of the ninth floor...

126
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,795
...and go on a little adventure?

127
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:31,134

131
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:47,025
I gotta run. But not with scissors.
That would be unsafe.

132
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:56,743
So if I move my horsey here...

133
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,956
...isn't that checkmate and I win?

134
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,297
Hmm.

135
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,718
Oh... Is it or isn't it?

136
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,680
You know, I think
this is a good stopping point.

137
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,769
It's your first real game.
I threw a lot of information at you.

138
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,145
No, your king is trapped.

139
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,065
He can't go here
because of my lighthouse...

140
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,942
...and...

141
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:34,114
...he can't go here
because of my pointy-head guy.

142
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,617
Like I said, complicated game.

143
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,453
- So did I win or not?
- Did you have fun?

144
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,789
Because if you had fun,
then you are a winner.

145
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,083
That's what chess is all about.

146

- Hello.
- Hey.

147
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,338
Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.

148
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:54,009
Why? My spot, your spot.
What difference does it make?

149
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,600
- Okay, what just happened?
- I don't know.

150
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,019
Between you playing chess
like Bobby Fischer...

151
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,646
...and Sheldon being okay
with you in his spot...

152
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,940
...I'm guessing
someone went back in time...

153
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,152
...stepped on a bug,
and changed the course of human events.

154
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,449
- Sweetie, are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

155
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,452
It's been six days
since I was supposed to get a haircut...

156
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,495
...and nothing horrible has happened.

157
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,582
Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand.

00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,170
- Leonard, explain it to her.
- Oh, uh, he's crazy.

...by carefully planning
every moment of every day.

161
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,057
But all my efforts, our dinner schedule,
my pajama rotation...

162
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,225
...my bowel movement spreadsheet...

163
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,563
it's clear now,
I've been wasting my time.

164
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,776
Good. I'm taking that disgusting chart
off the fridge.

165
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,778
You know...

166
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,280
...sometimes it's nice
not knowing what's coming.

167
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,573
Look at me and Leonard.

168
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,492
We went out, broke up,
trying again.

169
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,118
We don't know what's gonna happen.

170
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,788
Oh, please, everyone knows
what's going to happen.

171
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,583
But I see your point.

172
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,418
I think this could be good for you.

173
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,797
Maybe it's time for you
to shake things up a bit.

174
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,340
You're right.

175
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,217
I should embrace the chaos.

176
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,554
- Great. What are you gonna do first?
- I don't know.

177
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,475
I could do anything. All bets are off.

178
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,395
The world is my oyster.

179
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,563
I got it.

180
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,982
I'm gonna put on
my Tuesday pajamas tonight.

181
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,240
I got to tell you,
I'm a little worried about him.

182
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,950
If I were you, I'd be worried...

183
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,704
...that a girl who's never played chess
in her life just kicked your ass.

184
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,260
Hi.

185
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,971
Howie, what happened to you?

186
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,350
We did overnight survival training
in the wilderness.

187
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,312
Big fun. Big, big fun.

188
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,023
I was gonna freshen up for you...

189
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:19,070
...but I blacked out a little
on the way to the bathroom.

190
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,781
Survival training?
Is that like camping?

191
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,327
Uh-huh. Except you don't have food
or water...

192
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,247
...and they don't have
a sunset Sabbath service...

193
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,125
...like they do at Camp Hess Kramer.

194
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,795
- Do you sleep in tents?
- No.

195
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:43,011
I slept in a hole I dug in the ground
with my bare hands.

196
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:49,309
And at some point during the night,
an armadillo crawled in...

197
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,729
...and spooned me.

198
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,276
- Poor baby.
- But I did it. I survived.

199
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:02,947
I wasn't sure
I was going to when the sandstorm hit.

200
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:09,829
I just pulled my turtleneck up
over my head and waited for death.

201
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,459
But somehow as I sat there...

202
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:18,755
...wrapped in a cocoon
of my own neck-sweat...

203
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,051
...I found that primal part
of the human spirit...

204
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,933
...that just wants to keep on living,
heh-heh, no matter what the cost.

205
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,977
You're so brave. I'm proud of you.

206
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,939
I ate a butterfly.

207
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,782
It was so small...

208
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,035
...beautiful...

209
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,580
...but I was so hungry.

210
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:59,420
- Are you crying?
- No, I don't think it's possible.

211
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,715
I'm severely dehydrated.

212
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,469
My pee is like toothpaste.

213
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,640
Howie, if you're not able to do this,
come home.

214
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,601
It won't change how I feel about you.

215
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:17,188
Thanks, honey, but I can't quit.

216
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,649
If I do, I'd just be a guy...

217
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,778
...who had a chance to be an astronaut
and gave it up.

218
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,989
Is there anything I could do to help?

219
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,074
No.

220
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,536

Sheldon got bongos.

237
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,408
- Why did you get bongos?
- Richard Feynman played the bongos.

I thought I'd try.

239
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,620
