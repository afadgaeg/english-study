1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,335
Okay, it's done.
Look, guys,

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,128
for the future, I don't mind
killing the big spiders,

3
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:08,303
but you have to at least try
with the little ones.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,746
Please. We're facing a far more
serious problem than stray arachnids.

5
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:14,505
It's not so bad.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,875
Not bad? It's horrible.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,645
You hear stories about this things,
but you never think it'll happen to you.

8
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:23,929
So they steamed your dumplings.
Get over it.

9
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,522
- New topic, please.
- All right, Penny.

10
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:31,327
Let me take this
opportunity to point out

11
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:34,502
that you are looking
particularly ravishing today.

12
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:38,797
Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,891
So, there is a number.

14
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,820
Okay, new topic, please.

15
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:49,829
Did you hear the people
upstairs in 5A are moving out?

16
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:51,884
What?!

17
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:54,804
- The people upstairs are moving out.
- No!

18
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:56,831
The horror...

19
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:01,185
Why would you just say
something like that?

20
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,206
- How else was I supposed to say it?
- Slowly.

21
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:10,653
Like putting a new fish in a tank.
You don't just drop it in.

22
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,024
You let the bag sit
in the water a while.

23
00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:16,544
The horror...

24
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:21,340
- I'm sure it's going to be fine.
- No, it's not going to be fine.

25
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:24,565
Change is never fine.
They say it is, but it's not.

26
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:28,170
Honey, did you even know
the people that are moving out?

27
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:29,735
I never met them.

28
00:01:29,886 --> 00:01:31,886
That's what made them perfect.

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,393
There were no awkward
"hellos" in the halls.

30
00:01:34,518 --> 00:01:37,918
There's no clickety-clacking
of high heel shoes on hardwood floors.

31
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:39,948
They may as well have
been a family of cats

32
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:42,623
just jumping around
from drape to drape.

33
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:45,912
Without that annoying
ammonia urine smell.

34
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:50,024
I'm sure the new people
will be just as quiet.

35
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:53,027
You can't know that.
How can you possibly know that?

36
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,862
You're right, I can't. You know what?
Anyone could rent that apartment now:

37
00:01:56,987 --> 00:01:59,744
an opera singer,
the cast of <i>Stomp</i>...

38
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,957
Yeah, a tap-dancing pirate
with a wooden leg.

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,224
Why are you making it worse?

40
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:11,172
I tried making it better.
He wouldn't go for it.

41
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:14,257
You're right!
That's a great idea.

42
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,328
- What?
- I'll take the apartment upstairs.

43
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:18,311
I can finally get
away from my mother

44
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:21,394
and we can all spend
some more time together.

45
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,119
If you catch my drift.

46
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:27,298
The horror...

47
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:50,196
Subtitles: The FWT Team

48
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:55,883
Hold on. You honestly expect me
to believe that social protocol

49
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,343
dictates we break our backs
helping Wolowitz move,

50
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:00,868
and then he only
need buy us a pizza?

51
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:04,651
I'm sorry, that really is
how it works.

52
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:06,939
You're tricking me.

53
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:10,755
You tell me the truth,
what do we get?

54
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:12,900
Help me out here.

55
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:16,168
You get to choose between
a mountain bike or a PS3.

56
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:17,293
I knew it!

57
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:20,679
PS3, definitely PS3.

58
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,428
Who would pick a mountain bike?

59
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:26,979
Enough with the guilt, Ma.

60
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:28,624
We'll still see each other.

61
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,089
I'll come over every night
and have dinner with you.

62
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:32,781
The hell you will!

63
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:37,148
What am I running here,
a fancy restaurant?

64
00:03:38,746 --> 00:03:40,845
Does this look like Olive Garden?!

65
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:44,699
Okay, I get it, you're angry.

66
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:48,013
You don't want to see
your little bird leave the nest.

67
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:49,338
"Little bird"?

68
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,813
You're almost 30!

69
00:03:52,297 --> 00:03:53,968
Fly, for God's sake!

70
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,211
Fine, I'll stay!

71
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,865
Ya happy, crazy lady?
I sure as hell hope so,

72
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,739
because you're ruining my life!

73
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:06,669
Hey, Penny? Good news,
you can take your head out of the oven.

74
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:10,415
I guess I won't be needing this.

75
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,218
The new ones.

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,335
They're here.

77
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:28,141
Stay calm. We don't know
anything about them yet.

78
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:35,374
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking for musical instruments.

79
00:04:36,555 --> 00:04:39,005
Does that sound
like castanets to you?

80
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:40,821
The box says "kitchen."

81
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:44,617
So? Do cocaine smugglers
write "cocaine" on the box?

82
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:48,412
Hello?

83
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:50,122
- Hello.
- Hello.

84
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:56,712
I'm Alicia.
I'm moving in upstairs.

85
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:58,512
That is so great.

86
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,566
Oh, I'm Leonard.
I live downstairs.

87
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:04,695
Upstairs from here, but under you.

88
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,136
Not under you per se, but...

89
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:09,685
under your apartment.

90
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:12,691
- That's nice.
- Yeah, it is.

91
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:18,319
If that concludes
your faltering attempt to mate...

92
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:29,089
On a scale
of one to ten, how light of foot

93
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:32,477
would you describe yourself,
with one being not cat-like at all,

94
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:34,702
and ten being freakishly feline?

95
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:36,961
"Freakishly feline"?

96
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:41,006
Is that your answer or do you
not understand the question?

97
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,074
We'll come back to that one.

98
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,985
Hang on. Are you now
or have you ever been

99
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,781
a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?

100
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,865
- You're making her uncomfortable.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

101
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,690
If it helps you feel any better,
you're doing very well so far.

102
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:00,047
Next question: are you fertile?

103
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:02,319
What?!

104
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,698
I'm trying to determine whether crying
infants above my head are a possibility.

105
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:09,503
- I have no immediate plans.
- If that changes, let me know.

106
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:12,705
And finally, area rugs, pro or con?

107
00:06:13,262 --> 00:06:14,586
- Pro?
- Alicia?

108
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:16,911
- Yes?
- Welcome to the building.

109
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:27,758
Thanks so much for helping me.

110
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,189
Thank you so much for giving
me the opportunity to help.

111
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:34,778
Hey, guys.

112
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,854
This is Alicia, our new neighbor.

113
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:38,365
- Hi.
- Hi.

114
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:40,256
I'm helping.

115
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:42,789
I can see.

116
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:46,445
Alicia's non-musical,
childless and pro-rug.

117
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,697
She's still on probation, of course,
but I like her.

118
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:53,178
Cool T-shirt.

119
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:56,915
Oh, I don't usually dress like this.
I'm going jogging.

120
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,283
- You don't jog.
- I can start.

121
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:04,423
True, but the more likely explanation is
that you're out of clean clothes again.

122
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,884
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- You're welcome, Penny.

123
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,305
Please, you look cute.
I'm dressed like a slob today, too.

124
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:14,909
I think you look fantastic.

125
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:17,439
This one's a player, huh?

126
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,288
Yeah, be careful.

127
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:22,002
Thanks for the warning.

128
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:24,277
- I'll see you around.
- See ya.

129
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,072
I'm dressed like a slob today, too.

130
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:31,867
Oh, mimicry.

131
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,143
I enjoy mimicry.

132
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:36,413
I've been working on Admiral Ackbar
from <i>Return of the Jedi</i>.

133
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:39,099
"It's a trap."

134
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,963
You have to imagine me
with a giant squid head.

135
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,159
"It's a trap."

136
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:27,077
Come.

137
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,590
Congratulations,
I see you did your laundry.

138
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:34,263
- Sort of.
- How does one "sort of..."

139
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,348
I bought new clothes, okay?

140
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,699
- Is Leonard around?
- He's upstairs at Alicia's.

141
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:42,298
Oh. All right,
that's cool, no biggie.

142
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:45,933
He said he'd help me set up my printer,
but I guess I can wait.

143
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,849
What exactly is he doing up there?

144
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:51,024
In what I can only perceive
as a tactical move to destroy me,

145
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:54,533
he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali
setting up her stereo.

146
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:58,036
Oh, they're all up there?
Typical.

147
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,373
It's axiomatically atypical.

148
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:04,492
Up until recently,
they did not know her,

149
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:06,879
and had no encounters with her
in a previous location.

150
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:09,298
They never went upstairs
to visit the former tenants.

151
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:13,439
Your characterization of their behavior
as "typical" is demonstrably fallacious.

152
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,921
Now I see the giant squid head.

153
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:29,421
Oh, great!
Now, I have to start all over again.

154
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:34,156
Yeah, I thought about renting
this apartment,

155
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,524
but I'm really more of a
"downtown loft" kind of guy.

156
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:39,912
Cool. So are you in a loft now?

157
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:43,767
Oh, actually, I'm,
living with a woman in Altadena.

158
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:46,171
Purely platonic.
She's also my maid.

159
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:50,756
- Sounds like a sweet deal.
- I won't lie. It's pretty dope.

160
00:09:56,854 --> 00:09:59,142
I just wanted to bring you
a little housewarming gift.

161
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,731
That is so sweet.

162
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:02,978
- Come on in. Let's open it.
- Great.

163
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,164
Nice dress.

164
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,725
This? I'm dressed like a slob today.

165
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,443
The guys have been helping me
set up my sound system.

166
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,112
I've never had
such good-looking technical support.

167
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,658
Pish-posh.

168
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:21,428
I don't know, it means shucks.

169
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,913
"Shucks" means shucks.
Let one go once in a while.

170
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,419
You want to hear something awesome?

171
00:10:30,382 --> 00:10:32,381
Alicia is an actress, just like you.

172
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,911
That is so awesome.

173
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,679
Well, trying to be,
but it's so hard.

174
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:41,322
- I know, tell me about it.
- I've been out here 3 months,

175
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:43,576
and all I've gotten
is a couple of national commercials

176
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:45,476
and this recurring thing on a soap.

177
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,263
That's why I work
at the Cheesecake Factory.

178
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:51,942
I'm holding out for the right part.

179
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,659
What do you want as your default setting
for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?

180
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:03,328
Whatever you think is best, cutie.

181
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,999
Well, DTS has more low end, so...

182
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:17,610
Hey, guys, guys,
you will really appreciate this.

183
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:19,261
I read the best science joke.

184
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,471
You won't get it,
but it's right up their alley.

185
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:23,056
Anyway,

186
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:25,767
this physicist goes
into an ice cream parlor every week

187
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:27,657
and orders an ice cream sundae
for himself,

188
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:30,230
and then offers one
to the empty stool sitting next to him.

189
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,233
This goes on for a while until the owner
finally asks him what he's doing.

190
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:35,905
The man says,
"Well, I'm a physicist,

191
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,364
"and quantum mechanics... teaches us

192
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:43,178
"that it is possible
for the matter above this stool

193
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,517
"to spontaneously turn
into a beautiful woman

194
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:47,706
"who might accept my offer
and fall in love with me."

195
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:51,381
The owner then says, "Lots of single,
beautiful women come in here ever day.

196
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:54,693
"Buy an ice cream for one of them,
and they might fall in love with you."

197
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:56,107
And the physicist says,

198
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,892
"Yeah, but what are the odds
of that happening?"

199
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:06,725
It's a little insulting,
don't you think?

200
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:10,062
How would I know?
I'm not even sure I get it.

201
00:12:11,984 --> 00:12:12,773
Leonard?

202
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:16,443
If you're done with the DVD player,
can you set up my printer?

203
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,903
Yeah, I'd love to.

204
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:22,324
Maybe when you're done with her printer,
you could set up mine.

205
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,826
You know, like you promised...
a week ago.

206
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,787
Yeah, I'll get to it. Don't nag me.

207
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:31,859
Hello there.

208
00:12:46,884 --> 00:12:47,884
Who is it?

209
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,380
Hello, Penny.
It's open... Come in.

210
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,820
Sarcasm.

211
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:02,948
- Well, they're all still up there.
- You think I can't hear them?

212
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:05,630
Listen to that: stomp, stomp, stomp.

213
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:09,426
That's Wolowitz
in his stacked heels that fool no one.

214
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,042
I don't even know why I care.
I don't care.

215
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,014
Enough to memorize that stupid joke,
but that's all I care.

216
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,354
You know, Penny,

217
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,511
there's something
that occurs in beehives

218
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,010
you might find interesting.

219
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,600
Occasionally,

220
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,263
a new queen will arrive

221
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:29,390
while the old queen
is still in power.

222
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:31,143
When this happens,

223
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,000
the old queen must either locate
to a new hive

224
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,700
or engage in a battle to the death

225
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:39,176
until only one queen remains.

226
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:44,494
What are you saying,
that I'm threatened by Alicia?

227
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:47,325
I'm like the old queen of the hive
and it's just time for me to go?

228
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,680
I'm just talking about bees.

229
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,673
They're on The Discovery Channel.

230
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,847
What are you talking about?

231
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,015
Bees.

232
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:06,396
I just got that physicist joke.

233
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:12,934
Gee, Penny,
thanks for buying us dinner.

234
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,166
- Yeah, what's the occasion?
- No occasion.

235
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,215
Just felt like
getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.

236
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:22,889
Did you remember to ask for the chicken
to be diced, not shredded?

237
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:25,085
Even though the menu description
specifies shredded?

238
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,428
Brown rice, not white?

239
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:28,599
Did you stop at the grocery
for the good hot mustard?

240
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:30,785
And pick up the low-sodium soy sauce
from the market?

241
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,955
Good.

242
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:35,832
See how it's done?

243
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,707
What do we got going on tonight?

244
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:44,474
Playing Halo, watching <i>Battlestar</i>,
drop some Mentos in Diet Coke?

245
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:48,557
- You want to watch <i>Battlestar</i>?
- What can I say?

246
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,307
I got my geek on, boys.

247
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:56,375
No, PMS is different.

248
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:01,816
- Thank God you're home. I need help.
- What's wrong?

249
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,487
I got a callback to audition for <i>CSI</i>
to play a hooker who gets killed.

250
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:07,401
I'd watch that.

251
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,537
But my car is in the shop,

252
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:12,786
and I have to be
at Universal in 45 minutes.

253
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:13,995
I'll take you.

254
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:16,016
You're a lifesaver.

255
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,500
- I'll run lines with you in the car.
- Great.

256
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:21,336
And afterward,
I'll take you all out for Chinese.

257
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,004
Actually, we already have...

258
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:24,368
Starving.

259
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:29,901
... Chinese food right here.

260
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,515
They're gone, Penny.
They can't hear you.

261
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:38,662
I cannot believe they're letting her
just use them like that.

262
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,000
Anything she wants, they go
panting after her like trained dogs.

263
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:44,474
You know last week,
she had Howard drive all the way

264
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:47,153
to her uncle's house in Orange County
to pick up her TV?

265
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,803
You once had Leonard
and me get your television

266
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:51,477
from your ex-boyfriend.

267
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:55,369
Apples and oranges here, Sheldon.

268
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:59,916
I'm telling you, that girl is a user,
skating through life on her looks,

269
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,875
taking advantage of weak-willed men,

270
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,513
getting auditions
for stupid network shows.

271
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:06,626
It just creams my corn.

272
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,761
- May I interject something here?
- Please.

273
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,555
You got the wrong mustard.

274
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:21,284
Guess what?

275
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:22,897
I got the part on <i>CSI</i>.

276
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,527
Oh, boy.

277
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:27,402
Something wrong?

278
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:31,799
No, you know, congratulations.
I think you'll make a great hooker.

279
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:34,576
Thank you.

280
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:37,967
I got to ask you something.

281
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,040
How much do physicists make?

282
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:45,128
I don't know. I don't think a lot.

283
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,921
Yeah, that's what I figured.

284
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:51,081
Well, got to run.

285
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:53,248
The guys promised
to set up my satellite dish

286
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:54,782
and paint my bedroom.

287
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:59,184
Can I talk to you
about that for a second?

288
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:00,930
About what?

289
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,773
You know, it's just that Leonard
and Howard and Raj,

290
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,966
they aren't like other guys.

291
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:08,401
They're special.

292
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:11,488
Okay, they're special... and?

293
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,539
Let's see. How can I explain this?

294
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:17,452
They don't know
how to use their shields.

295
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:20,045
- Shields?
- Yeah, like in <i>Star Trek</i>,

296
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,570
when you're in battle
and you raise the shields?

297
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:29,381
Where the hell'd that come from?

298
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:33,677
Anyways, you know
how guys like this are, so...

299
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:36,795
please don't take advantage of them.

300
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:41,308
Who says
I'm taking advantage of them?

301
00:17:42,172 --> 00:17:44,324
Come on.
They're doing everything for you,

302
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:46,022
because you're leading them on.

303
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,112
So I let them do stuff for me.

304
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:49,817
They're happy. I get stuff.

305
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:51,111
Who cares?

306
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,754
And how's it any different
from what you do?

307
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,799
Excuse me?

308
00:17:57,863 --> 00:17:59,363
I've seen you around them.

309
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:02,382
Are you pretending
like you don't do the exact same thing?

310
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:03,778
Okay, lady,

311
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,900
you are way out of line.

312
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,837
I'm out of line?

313
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:10,839
Yeah, you're out of line.

314
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,056
What are you going to do about it,

315
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:15,051
bitch?

316
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:20,027
I like Green Lantern.

317
00:18:20,152 --> 00:18:22,519
I'm just saying it's pretty lame
that he can be defeated

318
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,119
by the color yellow.

319
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:27,772
Only the modern Green Lantern
is vulnerable to yellow.

320
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,364
Golden age Green Lantern
was vulnerable to wood.

321
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:33,570
Great, so I can take them both out
with a number-two pencil?

322
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,802
Oh, my God! Girl fight!

323
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,246
- What are you doing?
- I know you.

324
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:47,083
You're stupid enough to break it up.

325
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:58,741
May I say you look
very comely tonight?

326
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:00,983
Thank you.

327
00:19:02,627 --> 00:19:04,970
You're right,
this filly's been broken.

328
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:14,222
You set it on DTS, didn't you?

329
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,127
I had to.

330
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:18,198
She called me "cutie."

331
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,983
According to Alicia's Facebook page,

332
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:25,038
she's hooking up
with one of the producers on <i>CSI</i>.

333
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:28,504
Dead whore on TV,
live one in real life.

334
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:39,219
Great.

335
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,456
Now she's jumping
up and down on the bed.
