1
00:00:04,397 --> 00:00:06,255
The problem appears
to be unsolvable.

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,538
Maybe we could run
some computer simulations.

3
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:10,926
There are too many variables.
It would take forever.

4
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:13,417
We've got to be missing something.

5
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:14,915
Let's start again.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,990
The movie is playing here
at 7:20, here at 7:40,

7
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:20,770
here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,813
These theaters
have to be eliminated.

9
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:27,442
Why? They're state-of-the-art digital
projection, 20-channel surround sound.

10
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:29,814
Yes, but they have no Icee machines.

11
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:34,199
Despite my aggressive
letter-writing campaign, I might add.

12
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:37,786
What about the multiplex here?
The seats are terrific.

13
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,687
They have Twizzlers
instead of Red Vines.

14
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:42,707
No amount of lumbar support
can compensate for that.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,589
It's gonna take
at least an hour to eat,

16
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:47,620
and I don't see
a Sheldon-approved restaurant

17
00:00:47,745 --> 00:00:49,959
proximate
to a Sheldon-approved theater.

18
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:52,661
- We could eat after the movie.
- Unacceptable.

19
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,346
The delay would result in tomorrow's
bowel movement occurring at work.

20
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:00,724
Hang on, hang on.
There's a 7-Eleven here.

21
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:03,594
We smuggle Slurpees,
which are essentially Icees,

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,880
in under our coats,

23
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:08,024
after having a pleasant meal
either here, here or here.

24
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,064
I don't see how we missed that.

25
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:15,263
Excuse me, in what universe
are Slurpees Icees?

26
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:19,664
That's how we missed it.

27
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,877
Sheldon, would you be prepared,
on a non-precedential basis,

28
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:25,834
to create an emergency ad hoc
Slurpee-Icee equivalency?

29
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:29,078
You know I can't do that.

30
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:32,717
I guess we only have one option.

31
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,510
I don't see any way around it.

32
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:37,653
- Bye, Sheldon.
- See ya.

33
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:46,998
They're right,
it was the only option.

34
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:08,963
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

35
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,039
Shut the door!

36
00:02:16,164 --> 00:02:17,756
- Why?
- Just do it!

37
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,394
- Get inside and shut the door.
- Well, you didn't specify.

38
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:31,858
- Is Leonard around?
- He went to the movies without me.

39
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:33,633
It was the only option.

40
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:46,192
I'm sorry, I don't understand
which social situation this is.

41
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:48,700
Could you give me some guidance
as to how to proceed?

42
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:51,574
The building manager's showing
an apartment downstairs,

43
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,072
- and I haven't paid my rent.
- Oh, I see.

44
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:57,820
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
harboring a fugitive

45
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,595
from the 2311 North
Los Robles Corporation.

46
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:03,876
It's no big deal.
I'm just a little behind on my bills

47
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,684
because they cut back my hours
at the restaurant and my car broke down.

48
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:09,753
If you recall, I pointed out
the "check engine" light

49
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:11,628
to you several months ago.

50
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,439
The "check engine" light is fine.

51
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:16,314
It's still blinking away.

52
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:20,114
It's the stupid engine
that stopped working.

53
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:23,118
It cost me like $1,200 to fix it.

54
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:28,198
It occurs to me you could solve all
your problems by obtaining more money.

55
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,171
Yes, it occurs to me, too.

56
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,175
Hang on a moment.

57
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:48,946
Here. Take some.

58
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:51,258
Pay me back when you can.

59
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:55,178
- You got a lot of money in there.
- That's why it's guarded by snakes.

60
00:03:58,164 --> 00:03:59,780
- Take some.
- Don't be silly.

61
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,323
I'm never silly.

62
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,327
- Here.
- No, I can't.

63
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,779
Don't you need money?

64
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,101
- Yeah, but...
- This is money I'm not using.

65
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:10,768
But what if you need it?

66
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:14,254
My expenses account for 46.9%
of my after-tax income.

67
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:17,088
The rest is divvied up between
a small savings account,

68
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,447
this deceptive container
of peanut brittle

69
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:22,820
and the hollowed-out buttocks
of a superhero action figure

70
00:04:22,945 --> 00:04:25,895
who shall remain nameless
for his own protection.

71
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:30,637
Or her own protection.

72
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:36,941
- Take some.
- Really? I mean, are you sure?

73
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,020
I see no large upcoming expenditures

74
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,007
unless they develop
an affordable technology

75
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:43,985
to fuse my skeleton
with adamantium like Wolverine.

76
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,551
Are they working on that?

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,695
I sincerely hope so.

78
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:55,070
Well, thank you.

79
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,944
No, I can't.

80
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,136
Honey, I don't want things
to be weird between us.

81
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,746
Won't it also be weird
if I have to say hello to you

82
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:28,758
every morning on my way to work
and you're living in a refrigerator box

83
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:30,954
and washing your hair
with rain water?

84
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,792
- I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
- Of course you will.

85
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:39,698
It's impossible to pay me back
sooner than you can.

86
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,722
Assuming you subscribe to a linear
understanding of time and causality.

87
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,316
I'm regretting this already.

88
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:54,235
I've given the matter some thought,
and...

89
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:58,369
I think I'd be willing to be a house pet
to a race of super-intelligent aliens.

90
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,186
Interesting.

91
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:03,886
Ask me why.

92
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,729
Do I have to?

93
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,618
Of course. That's how
you move a conversation forward.

94
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:11,694
Why?

95
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,444
The learning opportunities
would be abundant.

96
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:17,419
Additionally, I like
having my belly scratched.

97
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,694
- Hey, Penny. How was work?
- Great.

98
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:26,593
I hope I'm a waitress at the
Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.

99
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:28,136
Was that sarcasm?

100
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:31,305
Was that sarcasm?

101
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:35,446
- Was that sar...
- Stop it!

102
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:41,066
- You appear to have a package here.
- Oh, thanks.

103
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,996
This must be the beret I ordered.

104
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:45,871
A couple of months ago.
It was back-ordered.

105
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:48,242
Did you know the beret is an example

106
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,960
of a piece of women's fashion
adapted from male military uniforms?

107
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:54,950
Another fascinating example
is the epaulet.

108
00:06:57,498 --> 00:07:00,376
He's not lying.
He does find that fascinating.

109
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,248
Whatever. It's not like
I'm running up and down the streets

110
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:05,849
just buying myself berets.

111
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:08,174
I bought one a month ago,
and it was back-ordered.

112
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:10,637
- Look, it finally arrived, all right?
- All right.

113
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,111
Oh, my God, would you just
get off my case?!

114
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:19,720
- Weird.
- Good, that was an unusual interaction.

115
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:20,995
I wasn't sure.

116
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,282
- Did you guys have an argument?
- No.

117
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:28,542
You clearly did something
to aggravate her.

118
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,056
I'm at a loss.

119
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:33,659
If you like, you can review
my daily log of social interactions

120
00:07:34,316 --> 00:07:37,038
and see if there's
a blunder I overlooked.

121
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:39,964
Here you go.

122
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:43,939
You owe me another two dollars.
The price of moo shu pork went up.

123
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:47,162
It's getting tougher and tougher
to be a bad Jew.

124
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,397
Here you go, Penny.
Shrimp with lobster sauce.

125
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:54,705
- Thank you. What's my share?
- Don't worry about it. It's my treat.

126
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,256
Really, how much?

127
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,809
Whatever. $10, $11.

128
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,685
Which is it, $10 or $11?

129
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,799
$14.50. But it's no biggie.

130
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:04,440
You'll get the next one.

131
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,487
What?

132
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:12,584
He was just wondering if he wore
skintight jeans and a tank top

133
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:15,259
if he'd get
his shrimp lo mein for free.

134
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:20,451
What are you saying?
That I'm using my body to get dinner?

135
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:22,917
That I'm some kind of Chinese
food prostitute?

136
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:28,003
Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?

137
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:31,075
Let me tell you something.
I pay my own way in this world, okay?

138
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,900
I don't rely on anybody!

139
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,136
What was that about?

140
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,211
He has a nervous bladder
when he's stressed out.

141
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:46,424
Kind of like a puppy.

142
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:51,738
Here, Leonard.
$10, $11, $12... $14.

143
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,907
It was $14.50, but it's okay.

144
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:57,989
Oh, good.
Dinner's here.

145
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:00,659
Yes, and I'm having some.
I'm having takeout food.

146
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:03,939
You're damn right it's okay. I've been
having leftovers at the restaurant

147
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:06,669
for like four days, and I wanted
something different. So sue me.

148
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,306
Forgive me, but that would be

149
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:11,084
the very definition
of a frivolous lawsuit.

150
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,512
I will pay you back as soon as I can.
You just have to give me more time.

151
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:18,564
- You lent her money?
- She need money.

152
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:20,109
You seem under pressure.

153
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:23,020
Did I not lend you a sufficient amount?
Because I can give you more.

154
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:26,757
You know, you would just
love that, wouldn't you?

155
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,945
You would just love to
open up your little snake can

156
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:35,442
and throw some money
at the girl who can't pay her bills.

157
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:38,409
- Where are you going?
- Going home,

158
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:41,196
where I won't be interrogated
like a criminal.

159
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,240
I forgot my fortune cookie.

160
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:54,884
In case either of you
have larceny in your heart,

161
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:58,746
you should know that I've moved
my money out of the snake can.

162
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,683
But if you're ever short, there's always
a couple of 50s in Green Lantern's ass.

163
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,023
- Hey.
- Hey.

164
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:19,014
A little mood lighting, huh?

165
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,037
When I didn't pay my bill,

166
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,427
the Department of Water and Power
thought I would enjoy the ambience.

167
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,500
Yeah, they're very considerate
that way.

168
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,752
I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent.
Then I had like $14 left over.

169
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:35,672
$14, huh?

170
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:40,264
Put it back in your pocket,
or I'll find some other place to put it.

171
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:43,315
Back in the pocket it goes.

172
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,473
You do understand

173
00:10:45,598 --> 00:10:47,981
Sheldon really doesn't care
when he gets the money back.

174
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,212
It's actually
one of the few idiosyncrasies

175
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:52,792
that doesn't make you
want to... kill him.

176
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,196
Yeah, well, that's not really
my big problem.

177
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,616
So you're a little behind on your bills.
Everybody gets behind on their bills.

178
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,952
I know, it's just...
This wasn't the plan.

179
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,621
It wasn't supposed to go this way.

180
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:06,373
What was the plan?

181
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:09,835
Waitress for six months
and then become a movie star.

182
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:15,340
- Was there a plan B?
- TV star.

183
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:20,778
It's probably not as bad as you think.
Let's take a look.

184
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:22,932
Maybe we can find
some corners to cut.

185
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,055
Here's something.

186
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,419
If you don't have electricity,
then you probably don't need cable.

187
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:32,614
Just a suggestion.

188
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:37,154
$170 dollars for acting classes?

189
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:40,775
No, I can't give up my acting classes.
I'm a professional actress.

190
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,157
You've had an acting job
where you got paid?

191
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:46,795
That is not the definition
of professional.

192
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,961
Actually, it kind of...
Let's keep looking.

193
00:11:57,212 --> 00:12:00,816
What's $1,800 to the Los Angeles County
Superior Court?

194
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:02,782
That's nothing.

195
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:03,907
Nothing?

196
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:08,060
It sounds like you got caught speeding
going 4,000 miles an hour.

197
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:10,812
Remember Kurt?

198
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:12,522
Your ex-boyfriend?

199
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,526
He got arrested for taking
a whiz on a cop car.

200
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,451
- What?
- He was drunk.

201
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:19,805
I would hope so.

202
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,528
He had a bunch of outstanding tickets
and a bench warrant,

203
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:26,078
so I, you know, I paid his fines.

204
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:28,538
- Did he pay you back?
- No, but he will.

205
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:32,717
And that's based on the inherent
credit-worthiness of people

206
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:35,363
who get drunk and urinate
on police vehicles?

207
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:39,557
Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt
and ask him for money.

208
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:43,452
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know,

209
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:45,639
but I may have to find
a cheaper place to live.

210
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:51,103
You don't want to do that.

211
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:52,312
Why not?

212
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,962
Moving is a big deal.

213
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:59,088
You have to go to the supermarket
and get boxes,

214
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,045
and if they're not clean,
your books smell like melons,

215
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,240
and it's like...

216
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,160
Why don't you just get a roommate
and stay here?

217
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,190
Do you know anybody?

218
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:13,125
I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon
wouldn't mind moving in with you.

219
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:18,421
Leonard, honey,
if we started living together,

220
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:21,068
I wouldn't be able
to keep my hands off you.

221
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:24,998
Really?

222
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:29,651
And you thought my acting lessons
were a waste of money.

223
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,584
This Moo Shu pork's burning
a hole through my duodenum.

224
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:42,798
Leviticus 11:3:

225
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,417
"Only that which parteth the hoof
and cheweth the cud

226
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,363
among the beasts shall ye eat."

227
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,390
Do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita

228
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,666
every time you scarf down a Whopper?

229
00:13:59,478 --> 00:14:01,072
- What's going on?
- We're on a quest

230
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:03,300
through the Valley of Fire
to acquire the sacred crown.

231
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:05,919
You want the Valley of Fire?
It's right here.

232
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:10,140
You guys want to go
on a real live quest?

233
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,329
Outside? I just made cocoa.

234
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,104
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- What is it?

235
00:14:17,012 --> 00:14:19,149
Do you guys remember
Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?

236
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:23,930
Yeah, that's him.

237
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:27,157
Turns out he owes Penny a lot of money,
and I'm gonna go get it from him.

238
00:14:28,656 --> 00:14:29,733
Who's with me?

239
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:35,348
Double sixes.

240
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:38,335
Really? You're just gonna
let me go by myself?

241
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:40,269
Cool, I got a sword.

242
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,689
I could use some help.

243
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:44,209
Here.

244
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:47,662
You guys are unbelievable.

245
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,548
You play a game
to simulate adventure,

246
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:51,927
but when there's real adventure
out there in the real world,

247
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,308
you just wimp out.

248
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,500
Do you not recall
the last time we visited this gentleman,

249
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,675
we returned home without pants?

250
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:02,815
- I do.
- Are you sure?

251
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,237
Because your proposal
suggests that you don't.

252
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:07,454
- I'm not afraid of him.
- All right.

253
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:09,566
Leonard fairly calls the question:

254
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:11,752
Who is in favor
of abandoning our game

255
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,687
and confronting Penny's
steroid-infused ex-boyfriend

256
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:17,826
in a suicidal mission
to extract money from him?

257
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:22,116
Say hi to Kurt for us.

258
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:25,400
Excuse me.

259
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,093
When Frodo left the Shire
to take the one ring to Mordor,

260
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,373
didn't Samwise, Pippin
and Merry go with him?

261
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:31,596
- They did.
- Well?

262
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,814
They had a terrible time of it.

263
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,931
Plus, no one stole their pants.

264
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:40,479
Fine.

265
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:43,604
Enjoy your little game.
I'll make this quest on my own.

266
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:44,859
Wait.

267
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,137
Take a jacket.
It's shpritzing a little.

268
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:50,598
You guys suck.

269
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,927
Come on, please? He's so big.

270
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,088
Is everyone clear on the plan?

271
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:02,961
Koothrappali's going to wet himself,

272
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,976
I'm gonna throw up,
Sheldon's gonna run away,

273
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:06,564
and you're going to die.

274
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:10,751
Shall we synchronize our watches?

275
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:13,430
Guys, there are four of us
and one of him.

276
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,178
Which means his triumph
will be even larger.

277
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,555
Minstrels will write songs
about him.

278
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,995
How about this? I'll do the talking.

279
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,400
You just stand behind me
and try to look formidable.

280
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,299
I should've peed before we left.

281
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:42,208
- Hi, Kurt.
- Lenny, right?

282
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,628
I don't really go by Lenny,
but that's okay.

283
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:48,882
You remember
Sheldon, Howard and Raj.

284
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:53,588
- What do you want?
- You don't remember me?

285
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,805
- How could he not rember me?
- Not now.

286
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,085
I remember him.

287
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,309
Here it is.

288
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:02,638
Penny's in kind of a financial jam,
and the money that you owe her

289
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:04,731
would go a long way
to solving her problems.

290
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:06,566
She sent you to get it from me?

291
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,338
No, no, she's too proud
to ask for the money.

292
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:12,238
I, on the other hand, feel
you should honor your debt.

293
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,407
You do?

294
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:19,609
"Feel" is a kind of a...
it's a strong word.

295
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,832
I just think it would be
a nice gesture on your part.

296
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,737
She'll get it when she gets it.

297
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:31,662
Well, there you go.
Problem solved.

298
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:36,529
A successful quest. Now let's go find
a gas station with a clean bathroom.

299
00:17:37,678 --> 00:17:39,432
No, the problem isn't solved.

300
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,214
- He just blew us off.
- I've got it.

301
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,953
He didn't remember me
because the last time we met,

302
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:46,710
I was in a Halloween costume.

303
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:50,694
Come on, Leonard, let's go.

304
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,279
You can leave if you want to.
I'm gonna see this through.

305
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,415
I guess, technically,
that was my fault.

306
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:12,118
I'm not leaving here
without Penny's money.

307
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:14,903
What happened to your backup?

308
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,370
I don't need backup.

309
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,514
I have right on my side.

310
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:27,383
And I'm wearing cargo shorts
under my pants.

311
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:31,602
Congratulations.

312
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:33,857
You may not have succeed
in getting cash,

313
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:36,990
but you did secure
a formal acknowledgment of the debt.

314
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,950
Maybe we should have
your head notarized.

315
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,953
If anybody cares,
I still have to pee.

316
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,181
- Is Sheldon here?
- Hang on.

317
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:03,802
Nice hat.

318
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:07,409
It's kind of a fashionable look
these days.

319
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:10,478
Maybe if you're working
on a tuna boat.

320
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,610
- Hello, Penny.
- Sheldon, here is your money.

321
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,695
Thank you very much.
It helped a lot.

322
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:17,505
Sarcasm?

323
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:22,814
Darn. I can't seem
to get the hang of that.

324
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:27,207
I know it's none of my business,
but where did the money come from?

325
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,487
Well, I cut back my expenses
like you said

326
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:31,736
and picked up a few more hours
at the restaurant,

327
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:34,589
but the biggest thing was,
out of the blue, Kurt shows up

328
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,466
and gives me the money he owes me.

329
00:19:37,454 --> 00:19:38,454
Really?

330
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:40,610
Did he say why?

331
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,558
He said he was feeling guilty
and wanted to do what was right.

332
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,839
That's it?

333
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:54,981
Did he give any reason
as to why he came

334
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,694
to this moral epiphany?

335
00:19:58,094 --> 00:20:00,365
I just think he's really changed.

336
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,995
We're having dinner tomorrow night,
and I get to wear my new beret.

337
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:07,987
Bye, guys.

338
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:16,232
Well done, Leonard.

339
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,924
The true hero
doesn't seek adulation.

340
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:24,722
He fights for right and justice
simply because it's his nature.

341
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:27,758
Penny's hooking up
with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend,

342
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:30,272
and I have indelible ink
on my forehead!

343
00:20:31,405 --> 00:20:35,275
That's your badge of honor...
your warrior's wound, if you will.

344
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,541
I was wrong.

345
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,396
Minstrels will write
songs about you.

346
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:43,199
Great.

347
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:46,434
<i>There once was a brave lad
named Leonard</i>

348
00:20:47,757 --> 00:20:49,817
<i>With a fi-fi fiddle dee-dee</i>

349
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,285
<i>He faced a fearsome giant</i>

350
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:56,290
<i>While Raj just wanted to pee</i>
