- What the hell?
- Emergency-preparedness drill.

3
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,686
- Oh, no. Come on.
- Yeah, you know how it works.

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,022
Once a quarter, keep our readiness up.

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,443
Now, rise and shine, sleepy head.
Half the town is probably dead.

00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,405
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>:
I have to get a lock for my door.

7
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,075
I think you'll like the drill tonight.
I've tried to make it fun.

8
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:39,955
Each of these cards contains a detailed
scenario of a possible apocalyptic event.

9
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:44,960
Everything from wildfires
to a surprise invasion by Canada.

10
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,839
Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.

11
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:54,136
Sheldon, Canada is not
going to invade California.

12
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:58,140
Yeah, really? You think those hippies
in Washington and Oregon can stop them?

13
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,226
Oh. Fine.

14
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:07,149
Alrighty. An 8.2-magnitude
earthquake devastates Pasadena...

15
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,195
...reducing mighty edifices to dust,
engulfing the city in flames...

16
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,865
...the streets flow with blood
and echo with the cries of the wounded.

17
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,827
Oh, excellent choice.
Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.

18
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,414
Oh, fun. I get to spend
another night in front of our apartment...

19
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,459
...dressed like one of the Village People.

20
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:31,215
You make that joke every three months,
I still don't get it. Leonard, wait.

21
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,802
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. What am I doing?

22
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:39,223
Look around you, there's hypothetical
broken glass everywhere.

23
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:45,771
Really? You're going to face Armageddon
without your orthotics? Your choice.

24
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,024
- Uh-oh! Hypothetical aftershock.

Check it out. Press release. From NASA.

28
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,726
Ahem. "Expedition 31 will launch this spring
to the International Space Station.

00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,365
This is going right into
my synagogue's newsletter.

33
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,120
If you're going to be an astronaut,
you need to pick a cool nickname.

34
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,831
I don't get to.
The other guys have to give it to me.

35
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,626
Oh. If I had one,
it would be Brown Dynamite.

36
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,591
Are you not listening to me? The other
astronauts have to give you your nickname.

37
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,552
Are you not looking at me?
I am Brown Dynamite.

38
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,308
Why do you put six sugars
in your coffee?

39
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:08,645
Because the cafeteria doesn't offer
little packets of methamphetamine.

40
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,773
- Emergency drill night last night, huh?
- Uh-huh.

41
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,110
- How'd you do?
- I'll tell you exactly how he did.

42
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,865
"Readiness: Unsatisfactory.
Follows direction: Barely.

probably die in a fiery inferno...

45
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,002
...his incessant whining would
most certainly spoil everyone else's day."

46
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,549
You know what, I'm so tired
I can't even think straight. I'm going home.

47
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,052
Can one of you
give this nutbag a ride later?

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,639
You can't go home.
You have to take me to the dentist at 4:00.

49
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,100
- Oh. Can't you take the bus to the dentist?
- Of course I can.

50
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,854
It's coming back under the effects
of the anesthesia that's the problem.

51
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,398
Two years ago,
after a deep gum cleaning...

52
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,861
...I thought I got on a bus but somehow
wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.

53
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,826
- They put you under for a cleaning?
- Yeah, they have to. I'm a biter.

54
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,456
Okay, whatever. Sheldon, I'm exhausted.
I'm not taking you to the dentist.

55
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,835
Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under Section 37B
of the Roommate Agreement...

56
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,339
...Miscellaneous Duties,
you are obligated to take me to the dentist.

57
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:23,262
See? Here, after "providing a confirmation
sniff on questionable dairy products."

58
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,140
You know what?
I am sick of the Roommate Agreement.

It's ridiculous, I'm your roommate,
not your chauffeur.

61
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,982
I had better things to do yesterday...

62
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,527
...than drive you to the good
model train store in Garden Grove...

63
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,656
...because the one in Pasadena
has gotten too big for its britches.

64
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,159
Well, it has. Ask anybody.

65
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,412
I don't care. I'm done.

66
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:53,083
Hold on. Are you saying that
you want to invoke Clause 209?

67
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,087
I don't know what that is, but if it means
I can go home and sleep, then yes.

68
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,507
Think carefully here.
Clause 209 suspends our friendship...

69
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,343
...and strips the Roommate Agreement
to its essentials.

70
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,138
Our responsibilities toward
each other would be rent...

71
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,058
...utilities and a perfunctory chin jut
of recognition as we pass in the hall.

72
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,727
What's up?

73
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,607
Where do I sign?

74
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,194
Right here. Use your finger.

75
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,448
- There. Done.
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: All right.

76
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,660
That's it. We are now
no longer companions, boon or otherwise.

77
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,829
We are now merely acquaintances.

78
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,791
To amend the words of Toy Story,
you have not got a friend in me.

79
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,672
- I'm gonna go home and take a nap.
- Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.

80
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,468
I got pretty exciting NASA news today.

81
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:50,390
Next week, I fly to Houston for orientation
and zero-gravity elimination drills.

82
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:54,102
- What does that mean?
- He's gonna learn to poop in space.

83
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,024
Open the pod bay doors, HAL.

84
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,487
Maybe your nickname
should be Brown Dynamite.

85
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:10,327
Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.

86
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,415
What's up?

87
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,292
My apologies.

88
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,880
I would've been here sooner but the bus
kept stopping for other people to get on it.

89
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,383
I saved you a dumpling.

90
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,510
Oh. Your concern for me is touching.

91
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,805
It will serve you well
when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.

92
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,309
I'm sorry, Sheldon, I'm busy. I'm right
in the middle of my addiction study.

93
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:39,064
I've got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys,
and tomorrow we switch them to O'Doul's.

94
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,318
You're my girlfriend and
you're not going to cater to my every need?

95
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,737
Oh, where'd the magic go?

96
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,408
Sheldon, that's not
what girlfriends are for.

97
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,911
Although, you don't use them
for what they're for, so what do I know?

98
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,004
Howard doesn't make me
do his shopping, take him to the dentist...

99
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,300
- ...or pick up his dry cleaning, right?
- Absolutely. But when Ma's hips give out...

100
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,885
...you're up, kid.

101
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,975
Well, if Amy's too busy, it gives the rest of
you an opportunity to make my life easier...

102
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,186
...thus assuring yourselves
a footnote in my memoirs...

103
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,106
...tentatively entitled
You're Welcome, Mankind.

104
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,193
All right, then. Just shout when you hear
the task you want to undertake.

105
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,404
Uh, dentist.

106
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,743
Okay, we can circle back
to that one. Um...

107
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:38,415
Who wants to take me Wednesday morning
to get new heels put on my dress shoes?

108
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,795
Anyone? Oh.

109
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,714
That one had "hoot" written all over it.

110
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,967
Um, all right. Uh, dermatologist.

111
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,180
Allergist.

112
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,391
Podiatrist.

113
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,894
Supercuts?

114
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,480
Okay, okay, here's a fun one.

115
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:06,776
Um, I need a new picture frame and
I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs.

116
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,446
Who wants to spend the day
with me at Ikea?

117
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,241
- Their meatballs are good.
- What?

118
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,035
Nothing. Nothing.

119
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,289
Hello, Stuart.

120
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,833
Oh, hey, Sheldon.
Can I help you find something today?

121
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,794
No, I was just sitting at home...

122
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,924
...thinking about how it might be nice
to catch up with my ninth-favorite person.

123
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,843
- Ninth?
- You moved up one.

124
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,597
My pen pal in Somalia
was kidnapped by pirates.

125
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,309
So, uh, how are you?

126
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,939
Uh, not so good.
My shrink just killed himself...

127
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,399
...and blamed me in the note.

128
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,987
Great, great.

129
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,660
So, what's new with your family?
How's your mother? Is she alive?

130
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,119
Yeah.

131
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,831
- Your father. Alive?
- Yes.

132
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,752
- How about your grandparents, they alive?
- No.

133
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,463
Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss.

134
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:13,093
On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning
appointment this afternoon.

135
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,013
What do you say you take me over there,
buddy boy?

136
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,808
Sorry, you want me to take
you to the dentist?

137
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,644
Yes. And, now,
I can't make any promises...

138
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:27,857
...but that's the sort of thing that gets a fella
on the list for the number eight friend slot.

139
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,319
Sheldon, I'm working.
I can't take you to the dentist.

140
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:37,158
Also, and I can't stress this enough,
I don't want to take you to the dentist.

141
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,829
Can't help a friend out
in a time of need, huh?

142
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,081
I see where your therapist
was coming from.

143
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,880
Ooh, ooh. What about we make
your astronaut nickname...

144
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,217
...Howard "Buzz" Wolowitz?

145
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,804
You can't do Buzz. Buzz is taken.

146
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,432
Buzz Lightyear is not real.

147
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,187
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

148
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,107
Well, are you talking about
when he thought he was real?

149
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,486
No.

150
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:18,575
Okay, um, oh, how about Crash?
Howard "Crash" Wolowitz.

151
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:24,873
Terrific. The astronauts would love hurtling
through space with a guy named Crash.

152
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,253
All right, uh, how about...?
Oh, how about Rocket Man?

153
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,341
That's not bad.
Howard "Rocket Man" Wolowitz.

154
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,385
It's great, but I told you,
I don't get to pick my nickname.

155
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,554
It has to come from the other astronauts.

156
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,265
Maybe there's a way
to get them to come up with it.

157
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,850
Like how?

158
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,186
Once I tried carrying around
a Duncan yo-yo...

159
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,522
...hoping the other kids
would start calling me Duncan.

160
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,151
- Did it work?
- No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth...

161
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,740
...because they took away my yo-yo
and stuffed their socks in my mouth.

162
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,497
Okay. Uh, what if we make
"Rocket Man" your ringtone...

163
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:10,085
...and the next time you talk to those guys,
I'll call you and they'll hear it.

164
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,878
That's not a terrible plan.

165
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,298
They don't call me
Brown Dynamite for nothing.

166
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,844
- What's up?
- What's up?

167
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,098
You ever make it to the dentist?

168
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:28,186
Not necessary. I found a service that'll send
a van to your house for a teeth cleaning.

169
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,355
Mostly they cater to dogs...

170
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,819
...but the fellow on the phone
seemed to have an open mind.

171
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,115
All right, Sheldon, if you need me
to take you to the dentist, I will take you.

172
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,909
Are you suggesting
that you've come to your senses...

...and wish to reestablish the benefits
that stem from the Roommate Agreement?

174
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:52,502
Absolutely. If you admit you're a 30-year-old
man incapable of functioning on his own.

175
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,880
Ooh. Sock Mouth's got him on the ropes.

176
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,719
I will admit nothing of the sort.
And now, if you'll excuse me...

177
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:05,223
...I have to call my dentist and see if I can
get my hair shampooed and nails clipped.
