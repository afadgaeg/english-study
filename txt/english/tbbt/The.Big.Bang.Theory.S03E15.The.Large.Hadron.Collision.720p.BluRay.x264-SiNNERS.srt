1
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:06,003
Yeah, I miss you too, sweetie. Ha, ha.

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,835
Okay, listen, I gotta go,
but I'll see you tonight.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,977
Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye.

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,908
No, you hang up first.

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,171
Hello?

6
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,979
Dude, I'm glad
you finally got a girlfriend...

7
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,418
...but do you have to do lovey-dovey
in front of us who don't?

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,182
Actually, he might have to.

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,487
There's an economic concept
known as a "positional good"...

10
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:32,860
...in which an object is only valued
because it's not possessed by others.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,491
The term was coined in 1976
by economist Fred Hirsch...

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,697
...to replace the more colloquial
but less precise "neener-neener."

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,173
That's not true. My happiness
is not dependent on my best friend...

14
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,539
- ...being miserable and alone.
- Thank you.

15
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,704
I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a perk.

16
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,848
- Who's miserable and alone?
- Me.

17
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,386
Oh. I used to be like that.
Then I got a girlfriend.

18
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,253
In pre-1976 terms, "neener-neener."

19
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,355
What are you and Bernadette doing
for Valentine's Day?

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,364
Yeah, I'm pulling out all the stops.
There's a 39.95 Lover's Special...

21
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,899
...at P.F. Chang's.

22
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,198
Yeah, egg rolls, dumplings,
bottomless wok.

23
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,240
Yeah, and you get your picture taken
on the big marble horse out front.

24
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,934
Given that Saint Valentine...

25
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,706
...was a third century Roman priest
who was stoned and beheaded...

26
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,112
...wouldn't a more appropriate
celebration...

27
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,776
...be taking one's steady gal
to witness a brutal murder?

28
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,222
I understand your point,
but given the choice...

29
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,552
...Jews always go with Chinese food.

30
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:38,056
If anyone's interested,
I'll be spending this Valentine's Day...

31
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,256
...the same way
I spend every Valentine's.

32
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,801
Buying rotisserie chicken,
taking it home, standing over the sink...

33
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:47,839
...and eating it out of the package
with my bare hands like an animal.

34
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,810
Okay, so to sum up,
one giant marble horse...

35
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,938
...one asinine comment,
one lonely man and his chicken...

36
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,777
...and let's see. Who's left?

37
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,818
Oh, that's right, my plans.

38
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,447
Isn't anyone gonna ask?

39
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,959
- You're gonna have sex with Penny.
- That's not what I was gonna tell you.

40
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,654
It's okay. I don't mind hearing
about your sex life.

41
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,663
It's his that bugs me.

42
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,427
Guess who the university
is sending to Switzerland...

43
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,701
...to attend a conference and see the
CERN Super Collider on February 14th?

44
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,605
Professor Norton. God knows why.

45
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:28,305
He hasn't published anything of note
since he won that Nobel Prize.

46
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,474
Professor Norton can't make it.
He threw his back out climbing.

47
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,348
I heard he threw his back out
climbing on his girlfriend.

48
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,819
- Weathergirl on Channel Two?
- That's the one.

49
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,448
In any case,
they're asking me to fill in for him.

50
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,323
In Switzerland
or with the big-boobed weather girl?

51
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:47,128
Switzerland.
And I get to bring a guest.

52
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,463
- Oh, no way, dude!
- Oh, my God, this is incredible.

53
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,663
I'm so happy I'm not gonna question
their judgment in picking you.

54
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,407
I'm just gonna run home
and start packing.

55
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,075
Wait, why wouldn't you take Penny?

56
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,750
I am taking Penny.

57
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,750
Oh.

58
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,186
Then I anticipate an awkward situation
when you get home.

59
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:43,682
- Sheldon, you got a minute?
- Of course, my good friend. Come in.

60
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,114
Yeah, help me out.

61
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:50,389
Which ski hat says,
"Apr�s Super Collider"?

62
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,392
Sheldon,
I'm not taking you to Switzerland.

63
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,264
Well, of course you are.
Who else would you take?

64
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,298
- Penny.
- What? That's absurd.

65
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,910
Penny has no interest
in subatomic particle research.

66
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,768
Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day.

67
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:11,077
We can go sightseeing and skiing
and make love in front of a roaring fire...

68
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,947
...in the shadow
of the snow-capped Alps.

69
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,786
But Penny has no interest
in subatomic particle research.

70
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,059
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

71
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:25,096
Sorry? I've been dreaming about
going to the Large Hadron Collider...

72
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,789
...since I was 9 years old.

73
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:31,597
I've been dreaming about spending
Valentine's with a girl since I was 6.

74
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,064
Shame on you.

75
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,604
That's no dream for a scientist.

76
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,479
- Okay, what's the big surprise?
- Just a minute.

77
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,482
This tray contains clues...

78
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:49,588
...as to what you and I are going
to be doing on Valentine's Day.

79
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,691
Oh, wow, okay. Let's see.

80
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:58,320
We've got milk chocolate,
Swiss cheese, fondue.

81
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,963
My lactose-intolerant boyfriend
is gonna eat all this...

82
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,002
...then I'm gonna climb on his back
and rocket to the moon?

83
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,104
No.

84
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,606
But it does involve air travel.

85
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,647
Okay. Um...

86
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:24,053
Let me slice this Swiss cheese
with my Swiss Army knife...

87
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,317
...and then you can wash it down...

88
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,486
...with a cup
of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.

89
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,633
Okay, I'm starting to think
"Swiss" is key here.

90
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,724
Uh-huh.

91
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,362
We're going to Disneyland
and ride the Matterhorn.

92
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,169
How does that involve air travel?

93
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,875
We're going to Disney World
and ride the Matterhorn.

94
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,008
- No.
- Okay, sweetie, this started out fun...

95
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,742
...but I'm over it.

96
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:58,021
We're going to Switzerland
to see the CERN Super Collider.

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,387
And ski. We'll also go skiing.

98
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,996
- We're going skiing in Switzerland?
- You'll ski, I'll fall.

99
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,102
But, yeah, we will be in Switzerland
for Valentine's Day.

100
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,830
- Oh, my God, Leonard, that's incredible.
- Ha-ha-ha.

101
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,338
Not so fast.

102
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,701
You might wanna hold off
on lighting your R��beliechtli, Penny.

103
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,278
My ribee-what-ly?

104
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,840
R��beliechtli, it means turnip light...

105
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:26,008
...and refers to a lantern
hand-carved from a root vegetable...

106
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,349
...to celebrate Swiss festivals
which you'll not be celebrating...

107
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,548
...because, A,
these festivals occur in the fall...

108
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,691
...and B,
you will not be going to Switzerland.

109
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,855
Sheldon, we've been through this.
I'm taking Penny.

110
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,194
Afraid not. Do you recognize this?

111
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:46,066
- Oh, not the roommate agreement.
- Indeed, the roommate agreement.

112
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,901
I call your attention
to the Friendship Rider...

113
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,543
...in Appendix C: Future Commitments.
Number 37:

114
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,875
"In the event one friend is ever invited
to visit the Large Hadron Collider...

115
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,951
...now under construction, he shall invite
the other friend to accompany him."

116
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,553
Oh, for God's sakes.

117
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,553
You actually put that
in an agreement?

118
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,625
We put in what happens
if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant...

119
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:12,390
...or if one of us gets superpowers,
or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.

120
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,629
He can't kill me. Even if I turn.

121
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,434
Is there anything about
if one of you gets a girlfriend?

122
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,904
No, that seemed a little far-fetched.

123
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,674
Sheldon, do you really expect
to enforce this?

124
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,441
I've lived up to my commitments
under the agreement.

125
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,417
At least once a day I ask how you are,
even though I simply don't care.

126
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,957
I no longer stage spontaneous
biohazard drills after 10 p.m.

127
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,492
And I abandoned my goal
to master Tuvan throat singing.

128
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,764
- I shouldn't ask, but what is...?
- No.

129
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,768
I'd be much further along
if I'd been allowed to practice.

130
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,971
Look, Sheldon,
I know it's in the agreement.

131
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,944
If you turn into a zombie,
I promise I will not kill you.

132
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:07,280
In fact, I'll even let you eat my brains.
But I'm taking Penny to Switzerland.

133
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,781
- Is that your final decision?
- It is.

134
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,821
Very well.

135
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,789
It's not over, is it?

136
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,891
What do you think?

137
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,340
Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh?

138
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,343
Think it's gonna rain?

139
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:46,181
Instead of underpants, I covered
my crotch with potato salad. Thoughts?

140
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,495
I know what'll cheer you up.
Let's play one of your driving games.

141
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,494
All right. This game is called Traitors.

142
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,673
I will name three historical figures...

143
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,707
...put them in order
of the heinousness of their betrayal:

144
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:08,246
Benedict Arnold, Judas,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

145
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,778
You really think I belong
with Benedict Arnold and Judas?

146
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:15,916
You're right. Judas had the decency
to hang himself after what he did.

147
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,854
Can't you at least try to understand
how much this means to me?

148
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:27,532
Round two: Leonard Hofstadter,
Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.

149
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:28,927
Rupert Murdoch?

150
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,102
<i>He owns Fox
and they cancelled Firefly.</i>

151
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,804
Hint: He and Darth Vader
are tied for number two.

152
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,107
Sorry, I couldn't hang with you.
I had a date with Bernadette.

153
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:48,249
I know. I saw the tweet.

154
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,718
- So, what did you end up doing?
- Not much. Nuked a burrito...

155
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,451
...prayed to Hindu god Urvashi
your bowels'd loosen...

156
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,061
...and your penis would droop
like a willow tree.

157
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,732
- You seen Sheldon?
- No.

158
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,631
- Is he still mad about the Super Collider?
- Yeah, he thinks I betrayed him.

159
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,965
What would you guys do
if you were me?

160
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,400
I'd take Sheldon to Switzerland.

161
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,939
- Seriously?
- Absolutely. And I'd leave him there.

162
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,084
What the hell is that?

163
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,520
Uh, let's see.

164
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,627
Yep, 30 pieces of silverware.

165
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,548
Morning, old chum.

166
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,552
- What's going on?
- I've made you breakfast.

167
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,553
Juice, coffee...

168
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:01,626
...and pancakes in the shape of some
of your favorite fictional characters.

169
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,728
See, here's Frodo.

170
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,832
- You made Frodo pancakes?
- Yeah, I used coconut shavings...

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,968
...to do the hair on his feet.

172
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,964
If you need to void your bladder
before eating...

173
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,574
...I can keep them warm with this beret
that I thoroughly laundered...

174
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,575
...and pressed into service
as a pancake cozy.

175
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,069
Why are you doing this?

176
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,172
It's by way of an apology
for my recent behavior.

177
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:28,076
I've had some time to reflect
and I've come to realize...

178
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,246
...that friendship is not an aggregation
of written agreements.

179
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:35,758
It's the result of two people
respecting and caring for each other.

180
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:40,195
- Butterscotch scone?
- Thanks.

181
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,933
- It's good.
- What you're tasting is respect...

182
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,400
...and affection.

183
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,999
And about a pound of Crisco.

184
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,839
After breakfast,
I thought we could spend the day...

185
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,607
<i>...watching the final season of Babylon 5
with director commentary.</i>

186
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,273
<i>You hate Babylon 5.</i>

187
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:02,683
I do. It fails as drama, science fiction
and it's hopelessly derivative.

188
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,619
But you like it, and you're my friend.

189
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,786
Okay, great.

190
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,624
- Still not taking you to Switzerland.
- Drat.

191
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,562
No Frodo for you.

192
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,634
- Hello.
- Hello.

193
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,871
Let's dispense
with the friendly banter.

194
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,748
I believe you know why I'm here.

195
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,311
Well, I always figured
it was to study us...

196
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:37,388
...discover our weaknesses,
and report back to your alien overlords.

197
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,482
Yes, amusing.

198
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,152
Extraordinary intelligence might well
appear extraterrestrial to you...

199
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,491
...but let me be more specific.

200
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,726
I believe you know why I'm here
in the laundry room.

201
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,397
Better acoustics
for your throat singing?

202
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,003
It's actually not bad.

203
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,510
But my true purpose in being here
will be revealed...

204
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:11,783
...in this brief PowerPoint presentation.
Ahem. Lights.

205
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,695
"Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD...

206
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,269
...should go to Switzerland
to see the CERN Super Collider:

207
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,804
A PowerPoint presentation
by Sheldon Cooper, PhD."

208
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,773
Oh, for God's sakes.

209
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,976
Here, we have a highly gifted researcher
in the field of particle physics...

210
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,946
...whose work has brought him
to the precipice...

211
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:42,144
...of forever changing mankind's
understanding of the universe, a.k.a. me.

212
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,558
And here, we have a waitress
brushing her teeth with her finger.

213
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,795
A.k.a. you.

214
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,460
Sorry.
Is this supposed to be buttering me up?

215
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,568
Please hold all questions
until the end of the presentation.

216
00:13:56,736 --> 00:14:00,467
This is the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN in Switzerland.

217
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,575
The product of decades
of planning and construction.

218
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,473
It is a mecca
for physicists the world over.

219
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,073
This is Bath and Body Works
on Colorado Boulevard.

220
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,084
They sell scented soaps and lotions.
Some of which contain glitter.

221
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,417
Now, let's see
if we can match the individual...

222
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,422
...to the appropriate destination.

223
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,984
Okay. Show's over.

224
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,596
No, it's not. I've got five more slides.

225
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,928
Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision.

226
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,501
He invited me to Switzerland
and I intend to go.

227
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,101
Very well.

228
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,776
Enjoy yourself.

229
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:42,437
You're gonna be in the presence of
something I've dreamed of for decades.

230
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,375
I hope you'll appreciate...

231
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,611
...the magnitude of where you are,
and what it represents.

232
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,190
I'll talk to Leonard.

233
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,055
- You will?
- Yes.

234
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,960
If it means that much to you,
you should go.

235
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,697
Oh, Penny, thank you.

236
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,962
- You're welcome.
- Since I rarely hug...

237
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:11,372
...I'm relying on your expertise
regarding duration.

238
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,611
- I think we're there.
- Oh, good.

239
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,707
Bye-bye.

240
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:25,319
Even though I don't have a girlfriend, I
can still have a good time on Valentine's.

241
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,891
Trust me, you can't. I've tried.

242
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,760
No, no, no.
I'm gonna have a "me" day.

243
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,490
I'm gonna go
to one of those spas in Koreatown...

244
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,224
...take a steam, get a massage.

245
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:39,394
Then I'm gonna stop at a pet store
and get licked by puppies.

246
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,274
- Sheldon, I need to talk to you.
- All right, my friend.

247
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,912
Would you like some cholermus?

248
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,738
- Some what?
- Cholermus.

249
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,849
It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish.

250
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:55,249
I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system
for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.

251
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,852
- You're not going to Switzerland.
- Oh, but I am.

252
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,926
Didn't Penny tell you the good news?

253
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,621
You went behind my back to guilt her
into letting you go instead of her.

254
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,857
Yes, that good news.

255
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,298
Forget it. I was the one invited,
I get to decide who goes with me.

256
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,030
And it's Penny, not you.

257
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,103
Howard, could you lower the lights?
I have a short PowerPoint presentation.

258
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:22,145
I don't need to see your presentation.
This discussion is over.

259
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,773
Well, that's a somewhat
ambiguous response. Am I going or not?

260
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,877
Sheldon, at this point...

261
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,545
...I would go by myself
before I would take you.

262
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,953
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

263
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,227
Well, then.
You leave me no alternative.

264
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,057
From this moment forward,
we can be roommates...

265
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,995
...but we will no longer be friends.

266
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,059
I'm sorry you feel that way.

267
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,898
I don't think you're fully aware
of the ramifications here, Leonard.

268
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,473
Why don't you enlighten me?

269
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,338
With the friendship clause
of our agreement nullified...

270
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,810
...you're no longer entitled
to accompany me to go swimming...

271
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,846
...at Bill Gates' house
should I be invited.

272
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,982
Ooh, that's gotta sting.

273
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,929
Think, this time tomorrow,
we'll be in Geneva, Switzerland...

274
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:14,260
- ...for our first Valentine's Day.
- I know.

275
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:18,426
I went shopping today and bought
special undies for the occasion.

276
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,095
Thermal? Because it's gonna be cold.

277
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,538
Think it through, Leonard.

278
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,608
- Oh.
- Oh.

279
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,614
Gesundheit.

280
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,241
Or as they say in Switzerland,
gesundheit.

281
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,120
- Getting a cold?
- No, no, it's probably just allergies.

282
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,688
You want an allergy pill?
I have them all.

283
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:47,458
Prescription, nonprescription, foreign,
domestic, experimental.

284
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,232
Do any of them work?

285
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,530
Not really, I'm just an enthusiast.

286
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,939
Penny?

287
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,314
You okay?

288
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,421
Did that sound okay to you?

289
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,815
Do not come in here.

290
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,487
What's going on?

291
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,596
I'm having a tea party.
What do you think is going on?

292
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,065
I think I might have the flu.

293
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,233
Or the plague.

294
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,510
Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m.
Do you think you'll feel better by then?

295
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,313
Yep. Because I'm gonna be dead.

296
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,456
Hey, Sheldon?

297
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,286
Listen, Penny's sick and she's not
gonna be able to go to Switzerland...

298
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:53,592
...so if you're still interested,
you're welcome to come.

299
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,770
Great. I'll start packing.

300
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,613
In a minute.

301
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,878
Oh, look, it's the cholermus.

302
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,193
Ugh. Here's your soup.

303
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,834
- Chicken?
- Yes.

304
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,731
- With the little stars?
- Yes.

305
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,370
Heated to 180 degrees?

306
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,408
Why don't I pour it in your lap
and you can tell me?

307
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,073
You don't have to be mean. I'm sick.

308
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:45,047
- Yeah, well, I'm sick too.
- Not my problem.

309
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,544
I don't understand
how this happened to me.

310
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:52,915
I'm scrupulous about my hygiene,
I regularly disinfect my hands...

311
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:57,222
...and I avoid contact with other people
on general principle.

312
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,587
I don't know what to tell you,
Sheldon.

313
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:05,032
Oh, Penny, thank you.

314
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,996
You're welcome.

315
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,538
It's you. I touched you.

316
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,115
Happy Valentine's Day.

317
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,890
Oh, my goodness, look at this room.

318
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:39,966
Champagne, roses,
oh, and little chocolates.

319
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:43,267
This is going to be
the best Valentine's Day ever.

320
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,478
Yeah, I forgot about all this.

321
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,471
But I never will.
