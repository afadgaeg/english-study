1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,708
This movie baffles me
every time we watch it.

2
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,173
What do you mean?

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:14,041
The instructions are very clear.
Don't feed the gremlins after midnight.

4
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,411
Don't get the gremlins wet.

5
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,317
How hard is that?

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,750
Hi, guys.

7
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,017
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,593
Oh, we're "honey" now, are we?

9
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,162
Yes. Since their relationship
became carnal...

10
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,993
...Penny has upgraded
his designated term of endearment...

11
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,692
...distinguishing him
from those she calls "sweetie"...

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,101
...in an attempt to soften
a thinly veiled insult.

13
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,508
You're boring people, sweetie.

14
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,513
Although sometimes
she omits the veil entirely.

15
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,050
- So, what are you guys doing?
- Celebrating Columbus Day.

16
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,551
<i>We're watching Goonies, Gremlins
and Young Sherlock Holmes.</i>

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,087
They're all written by Chris Columbus.

18
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,088
Okay. What do you watch
on Thanksgiving?

19
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,229
The parade.

20
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,791
That reminds me. I usually go back
to Nebraska for Thanksgiving.

21
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,062
This year, they're calling it off
on account of my brother's trial.

22
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,901
- What's he on trial for?
- Oh, just a big misunderstanding.

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,135
You know, you'd like my brother.
He's kind of a chemist.

24
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,139
I was thinking
I'd have Thanksgiving here.

25
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,478
- And you are all invited.
- Oh, I'll be there.

26
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:29,645
Will you be serving cranberry jelly
or cranberry sauce?

27
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,454
I guess I could serve both.

28
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,584
You guess? You don't seem
to have much of a handle on this.

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,121
Yeah, I really wish I could,
Penny, but every year...

30
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,293
...my mother has all the relatives over
and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.

31
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,462
Tur-briska-fil?

32
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,936
A turkey stuffed with a brisket
stuffed with gefilte fish.

33
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,506
It's not as good as it sounds.

34
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,613
Raj, what about you?

35
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,512
Oh, he usually comes
to my house. Right, pal?

36
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,849
Uh, all right. This year,
you don't have to eat the tur-briska-fil.

37
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,830
I don't even chew it.
I swallow it like pills.

38
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,383
So, what's going on with Raj?

39
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,357
Well, the good news
is he has no problem...

40
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,521
...with my mother's tur-briska-fil.

41
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,532
Hard to believe, but go on.

42
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,330
The bad news
is he says he's getting deported.

43
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,336
What do you mean
he's getting deported?

44
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,375
I believe it means the U.S. government
is going to expel him from the country.

45
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,844
He could return to India, immigrate to
another country willing to accept him...

46
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,711
...or wander the high seas
as a stateless pirate.

47
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,182
Personally, I'd choose pirate.

48
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,489
Penny, would you mind stepping outside
so we can speak to him?

49
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,722
Ugh. Fine, but the man really needs to work
on his girl issues.

50
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,026
Another reason
to consider a life of piracy.

51
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,068
Even today, I understand
that's an all-male profession.

52
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,738
Okay, she's gone.

53
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,680
Sorry I lost my cool.

54
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,283
So, what's going on?

55
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,749
Okay, here's the deal.

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,083
Six months ago, my research
testing the predicted composition...

57
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,747
...of trans-Neptunian objects
ran into a dead end.

58
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,086
So?

59
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,252
My visa is only good as long
as I'm employed at the university.

60
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,422
When they find out I've got squat,
they're gonna cut me off.

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,763
By the way, when I say "squat,"
I mean "diddlysquat."

62
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,929
I wish I had squat.

63
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,605
Wait. What have you been doing
for the past six months?

64
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,938
You know, checking e-mail...

65
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,104
...updating my Facebook status...

66
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,772
...messing up Wikipedia entries.

67
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:16,278
Did you know Netflix lets you
stream movies on your computer now?

68
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,159
You've continued to take the university's
money under false pretenses?

69
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,795
Highly unethical for an astrophysicist.

70
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,796
Although, practically mandatory
for a pirate.

71
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,296
I don't wanna go back to India.
It's hot and loud.

72
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,961
And there's so many people.

73
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,832
You have no idea. They're everywhere.

74
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,478
Okay, guys, think.
How do we keep Raj in the country?

75
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,449
Why doesn't he just get another job?

76
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:59,322
What are you asking me for?
I don't know if you can talk now or not.

77
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,834
Oh, beef.

78
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,803
I'm gonna miss you so much.

79
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,542
Did you know at the Mumbai McDonald's,
you can't get a Big Mac?

80
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,770
All you can get
is a Chicken Maharaja Mac.

81
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,842
And the special sauce?

82
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,645
Curry. Which in India,
believe you me, is really not that special.

83
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,688
- Don't worry. You'll find another job.
- Yeah, let me start practicing for it.

84
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,985
"Do you want fries
with that Maharaja Mac?"

85
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,522
Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.

86
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,528
Hello, Sheldon.

87
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,195
Forgive me.
I'm not adept at reading facial cues.

88
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:41,033
But I'm going to take a stab here.
You're either sad or nauseated.

89
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,537
- I'm sad.
- I was going to say sad.

90
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,200
I don't know why I hedged.

91
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,071
What are you eating?

92
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:51,546
Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger
and tomato sauce.

93
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,515
Oh, beefaroni.

94
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,348
I think I'll miss you most of all.

95
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,023
I've always been a little confused
about this. Why don't Hindus eat beef?

96
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,718
- We believe cows are gods.
- Not technically.

97
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,729
In Hinduism,
cattle are thought to be like God.

98
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:10,393
Do not tell me about my culture.
I'll take you out, I swear to cow.

99
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,897
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,534
Me too. I'm just... I'm a little on edge.

101
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,577
Mm, understandable. Your life seems
to be crumbling around you...

102
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,738
...and your future appears bleak at best.

103
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,243
Thank you.

104
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,942
And you're wrong
about Hinduism and cows.

105
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,787
Hey, Raj, Professor Laughlin
is looking for someone to join...

106
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,757
- ...the stellar evolution research team.
- You're kidding. That's fantastic.

107
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,761
- Call him and set up an interview.
- I'm on it.

108
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,596
- That's happy, right?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,926
Nailed it.

110
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,635
Dr. Koothrappali, come on in.

111
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,931
I was surprised to hear you're interested
in joining our team.

112
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,542
Giving up on those
trans-Neptunian objects, are we?

113
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,541
No, no. It's a very promising area.

114
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,942
In a perfect world,
I'd spend several more years on it.

115
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,606
I couldn't pass up the opportunity
to work with you...

116
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:02,084
...on your tremendously exciting and
not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.

117
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,655
Splendid. Please sit down.

118
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,085
Can I offer you a sherry?

119
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,124
It's a little early, isn't it?

120
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,593
Not on Proxima Centauri. Ha, ha.

121
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,992
Oh, that's very good.

122
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:17,797
Jolly amusing. But if you don't mind,
I'll hold off until sunset on Titan.

123
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,771
Ha, ha. Well done. I have a feeling
you're going to fit in fine, Dr. Koothrappali.

124
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:22,966
Thank you, sir.

125
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,302
I'm sorry. Am I late?

126
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,810
No, no. Right on time.

127
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,473
Dr. Koothrappali,
may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT.

128
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,642
She'll be heading up
our data analysis team.

129
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,981
It's nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali.

130
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,490
I read your paper on Kuiper Belt
object-size distribution.

131
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,628
I really enjoyed it.

132
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,696
How did you correct
for the selection bias?

133
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,663
Well, I ran a simulation.

134
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,500
Allowed me to correct
for the observational efficiency.

135
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:58,440
- Oh. That's just fascinating.
- Thank you.

136
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,307
Would you like to hear more about it
at my hot tub?

137
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,211
So when do I start?

138
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,453
You didn't get the job?
How could you not get it?

139
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:20,058
You know, he's British, I'm Indian.

140
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,532
Ever since Gandhi,
they haven't liked us very much.

141
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,870
Are you saying that he discriminated
against you? We should file a complaint.

142
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,703
That's okay. Complaint's been filed.

143
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,873
So that's it.

144
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,378
That was my last hope.

145
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,576
I'm gonna be deported.
Sent home in disgrace.

146
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,721
Exposed to the sardonic barbs
of my cousin Sanjay.

147
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,255
Or as you may know him,
Dave from AT&T Customer Service.

148
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,223
- I'm really gonna miss you.
- Will you come visit me in India?

149
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,560
Gee, that's like a 17-hour flight.

150
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,103
How about I meet you halfway?

151
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,537
Halfway is 600 miles
off the coast of Japan.

152
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,578
Tell you what, we'll Skype.

153
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,247
- Gentlemen.
- Hey.

154
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,113
Raj, did you get the job
with Professor Laughlin?

155
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,754
- No.
- I assumed as much, but never fear.

156
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,949
Like the subordinate male protagonist
in action movies who disappears...

157
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:24,426
...halfway through the second reel,
I have returned to save the day.

158
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,100
Odd. Usually he's met by cheers.

159
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:34,134
Anyway, I was thinking about exploring
the string theory implications...

160
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,605
...of gamma rays
from dark-matter annihilations.

161
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,937
- It occurred to me that I could...
- Excuse me.

162
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,138
How many reels before the subordinate
male protagonist gets to his point?

163
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,615
If you didn't cheer at my entrance,
it's too late to buy into the premise.

164
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,255
Anyway, I got some extra money
from the head of the department...

165
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,087
...and Raj can come work for me.

166
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,095
You want me to work with you?

167
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,827
For me.

168
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,624
You're going to have to listen
more carefully when you're on the job.

169
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,131
Okay. Please don't take this
the wrong way...

170
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,275
...but I'd rather swim buck naked
across the Ganges...

171
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,433
...with a paper cut on my nipple...

172
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,808
...and die a slow, agonizing death
from a viral infection...

173
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,778
...than work with you.

174
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,119
For me.

175
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,256
Sheldon, are you busy?

176
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,297
Of course I'm busy.

177
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,167
- Shall I wait?
- Yes, please.

178
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,313
How may I help you?

179
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,713
I've reconsidered your offer
to let me work with you.

180
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,555
For me.

181
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,823
Yes, for you.

182
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,127
I do, however, have a few conditions.

183
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,831
First, at all times, I am to be treated
as a colleague and an equal.

184
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,991
Second, my contributions shall be noted
in published materials.

185
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:14,572
Third, you are never allowed to lecture me
on Hinduism or my Indian culture.

186
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,566
I'm impressed, Raj.

187
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,007
Those are very cogent
and reasonable conditions.

188
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,579
- Thank you.
- I reject them all.

189
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,244
Then you leave me no choice.

190
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,180
I accept the job.

191
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,015
I'm sorry.
I believe you've misunderstood.

192
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,747
I'm not giving you the job.

193
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:35,019
I'm simply affording you the opportunity
to apply for it.

194
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,255
Have a seat.
We'll get started with the interview.

195
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,491
You're kidding.

196
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,532
Please.

197
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,769
All right.

198
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,706
So...

199
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,837
That's what you wear to an interview?

200
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,714
Come on, we've been friends for years.

201
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,945
Oh, pulling strings, are we?

202
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,382
Sheldon, for God's sakes,
don't make me beg.

203
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,224
Buzzinga.

204
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:13,124
You've fallen victim to another one
of my classic practical jokes.

205
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,561
I'm your boss now.
You may wanna laugh at that.

206
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,206
Ah. This is nice,
having the place to ourselves, isn't it?

207
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,401
Uh-huh.

208
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,638
Now that Raj is working for Sheldon,
I don't have to chauffeur him around.

209
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,784
Plus, yeah, with them working late
so much, we get some privacy.

210
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,145
Mm-hm.

211
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,315
Hey.

212
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,218
Wanna get a little crazy?

213
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,983
What are you thinking?

214
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,253
Let's slide over to Sheldon's spot
and make out.

215
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,493
You are a dirty girl.

216
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,595
Oh, God, how did he know?

217
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,669
Hello?

218
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,173
- Hi, Howard.
- Heh.

219
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,901
Am I interrupting?

220
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,602
Little bit, yeah.

221
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,111
Guess I should've called.

222
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,340
Yeah, maybe.

223
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:16,618
Tonight's the night I usually go
line dancing with Raj at the Palomino.

224
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,958
Uh-huh.

225
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,793
But he's working with Sheldon.

226
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,798
- Yes. We know.
- Hoo.

227
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,630
Want me to leave?

228
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,328
You know, whatever.

229
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,937
I guess I can hang for a little while.

230
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,476
So, what are we watching?

231
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,807
<i>Sex and the City, yikes.</i>

232
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,212
Hey, I happen to love this movie.

233
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,976
Fine. Let's watch it.

234
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,714
Maybe all our periods will synchronize.

235
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,220
We're going to be
designing an experiment...

236
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:54,560
...to look for the annihilation spectrum
resulting from dark-matter collisions.

237
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:58,500
Ooh, dark matter.
We better bring a flashlight, ha, ha.

238
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,234
I was making a joke.

239
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,741
I'm the boss. I make the jokes.

240
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,981
Sorry. Go ahead and make your joke.

241
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,241
This is not the time for joking.

242
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:15,481
We're doing serious research
which requires complete and utter focus.

243
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,749
All right. Let's buckle down and work.

244
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,282
- Sheldon.
- What?

245
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,618
- I need an aspirin.
- Top desk drawer.

246
00:14:58,931 --> 00:14:59,955
- Thank you.
- All right?

247
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,192
- Yes.
- Good.

248
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,035
That was fun, ha, ha.

249
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,235
Thank you.

250
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,540
Leonard, you don't have to say
thank you every time we have sex.

251
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,445
Oh, okay.

252
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,910
Tomorrow, you're gonna get a card
in the mail. Just throw it away.

253
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,227
Top of the morning to you.

254
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,424
What are you doing here?

255
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,327
Well, usually on Sundays...

256
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,095
...I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks
at the farmer's market...

257
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,102
...but he's still working with Sheldon.

258
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,834
So I thought I'd come over here
and make scrambled eggs and salami.

259
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,777
<i>It's the perfect meal for apr�s I'amour.</i>

260
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,076
Kill me.

261
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:57,188
By the way, I couldn't help overhearing
your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.

262
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,792
See, if you had killed me
when I said "kill me"..

263
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,690
...I wouldn't have had to hear that.

264
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,957
What do you guys think?
Wanna take in a matin�e? Go rollerblading?

265
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,964
Catch a step class?

266
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,299
- Do something.
- Yeah. Okay. Um...

267
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,270
Howard, we need to talk.

268
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,534
Sure. What's up, homes?

269
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,645
Please understand that it's not
that we don't want you around.

270
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:27,377
But Penny and I
occasionally need some alone time.

271
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:29,946
Oh.

272
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,316
I get it. I'm the third wheel. Heh.

273
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,826
Sorry, I should've seen that.

274
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,827
I'll get out of your way.

275
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,294
Uh, you're gonna wanna eat those eggs
while they're still hot.

276
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,663
Thank you.

277
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,967
And there's lox and cream cheese
in the fridge.

278
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,577
The bagels are in the oven.
I was warming them up.

279
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,342
That's great.

280
00:16:56,215 --> 00:17:00,015
I'm just gonna hang out with my mom.
That's always fun.

281
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,678
Good.

282
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,854
- Are we terrible people?
- I don't know.

283
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,363
What do you want me to do?

284
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,163
Ahh. Get him. Bring him back.

285
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,869
You sure?

286
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,506
Yeah.

287
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,369
Okay. Howard, come back.

288
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,771
Oh, you guys had me scared
for a minute.

289
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,878
No, no. That rate is much too low from
what we'd expect from this collision.

290
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,882
Do you understand we're talking about
dark matter colliding in outer space?

291
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,684
Of course I understand. And who
are you to tell me about outer space?

292
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,385
Well, I'm the astrophysicist.
"Astro" means "space."

293
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,592
"Astro" means "star."

294
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,962
Let me just tell you,
if we were having this argument...

295
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:53,196
...in my native language,
I'd be kicking your butt.

296
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,700
English is your native language.

297
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:01,210
Okay, you got me there.
But you're wrong about this.

298
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,644
There's a fine line
between wrong and visionary.

299
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,751
Unfortunately,
you have to be a visionary to see it.

300
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,253
God, you think that every thought that
comes out of your head is pure gold.

301
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,154
Let me tell you,
some of those thoughts are pure caca.

302
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,919
Caca?

303
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,926
- It means "doo-doo."
- All right.

304
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,261
First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first
proposed that you work with me...

305
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,266
Aha! So I am working with you?

306
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,132
In this context,
"with me" means "for me."

307
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,500
Oh. Yeah, well, in this context:

308
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,501
All right.

309
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,406
If I'm wrong, prove it.

310
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,603
Okay.

311
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,614
Here's where we derived the mass
of the dark-matter particle.

312
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,911
- You've misstated the weight.
- Let me finish.

313
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,920
- You're defacing my work.
- I'm not. I'm fixing it.

314
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,682
- Give me the eraser.
- No.

315
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,086
I said give it to me.

316
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,460
Come and get it.

317
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,126
Fine.

318
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,428
Oh, Lord.

319
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,472
Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior,
I forbid you from writing on my board.

320
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,304
- You are not my superior.
- I am in every way.

321
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,447
Oh, yeah? Can you do this?

322
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,645
Nice working with you.

323
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,887
I'm sorry. "For you."

324
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,504
Argh!

325
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,877
Raj?

326
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,142
Raj?

327
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,178
I'm busy.

328
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,378
Doing what?

329
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,486
- You've made your point.
- What do you want, Sheldon?

330
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,858
I looked over the board,
and it turns out you were right.

331
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,658
- You were wrong?
- I didn't say that.

332
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,825
- That's the only logical inference.
- I didn't say it.

333
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,836
Anyway, I would like you to come back
and work for me.

334
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,870
For you or with you?

335
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,209
In this context,
"for me" could mean "with me."

336
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,211
- I have conditions.
- I reject them all.

337
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,111
I'll take the job.

338
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,878
See you Monday.

339
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,715
- Wait. You have to drive me home.
- How did you get here?

340
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,379
- I walked.
- So walk home.

341
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,890
I can't. There's a big dog outside.

342
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,394
We can start thinking about methods
of optimizing the detector...

343
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,231
- ...for 500 GeV particles.
- All right.
