00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,755
It's amazing people keep coming
to comic book stores...

2
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:10,300
...instead of just downloading
comics digitally.

3
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:11,802
It's probably for the best.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,263
For a lot of these guys,
the weekly trip here...

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,766
...is the only chance their mom has to go
to the basement and change their sheets.

<font color="#E86CE4">(ALL CHUCKLE)</font>

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,521
Oh, that reminds me,
I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,318
Well, what do you think
of new comic book night?

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,821
Magic, huh?

10
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,698
Sheldon, I'm disappointed.

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,034
As a brilliant man,
you're entitled to a vice.

12
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,369
I could understand frequenting
an opium den...

13
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,164
...or hunting your fellow man
for sport.

14
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,417
But this? Lame-o.

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,172
A, comic books employ storytelling
through sequential art...

16
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:52,092
...a medium that dates back 17,000 years
to the cave paintings of Lascaux...

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,763
...and B, you play the harp,
like that's cool.

18
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,518
Can I help you find anything?

19
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:05,606
A comic that depicts a woman whose
bosom can't be used as a flotation device.

20
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,694
Sorry. Most of the guys
who come in here like big boobs.

21
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,404
A couple of them have big boobs.

22
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,326
The new Warlords of Ka'a
expansion pack is out.

23
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,411
A new one? Unbelievable.

24
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,872
They just keep making up
more cheesy monsters...

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,209
...slapping them on cards
and selling them at 25 bucks a pop.

26
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,670
It's like a secret tax on guys
who can't get laid.

27
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,675
They're not even trying. Remember the
Satanimals pack with the Hellephant?

28
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,887
Absurd. What was he, a bad elephant
who died and went to hell?

29
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,683
What could an elephant possibly do that
would cause him eternal damnation?

30
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,060
"Wild West and Witches."

31
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,480
What kind of loser
cares about a showdown...

32
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,400
...between Billy the Kid
and the White Wizard of the North? Heh.

33
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,194
A total loser.

34
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,781
Obviously, a guy with a six-shooter
beats an old man with a magic wand.

35
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,034
Well, ho... hold on.

36
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,330
Uh, what if the wizard casts
a helmet-of-confusion spell...

37
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,374
...on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?

38
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:09,002
What? Please.
This is Billy the Kid we're talking about.

39
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,713
The wizard would get shot
before he could get out the words:

40
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,592
"What the hell is Billy the Kid doing
in the mystic realm of Ka'a?"

41
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,345
Leonard, ahem...

42
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,973
...what's the deal
with Sheldon's friend Amy?

43
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,433
- Are they a couple?
- A couple of weirdos. Why?

Are you interested in Amy?

46
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,647
Well, I mean,
she didn't look through me...

47
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,569
...with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling
hatred and contempt.

48
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,320
I like that in a woman.

49
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,449
Could you run it by Sheldon
if I could ask her out?

50
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,993
Sure, I guess.

51
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,828
Stuart, settle an argument for us.

52
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,873
Who would win,
Billy the Kid or the white Wizard?

If I tell you that, I'm robbing you

55
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:56,300
...for the magical, rootin'-tootin
low price of 24.95.

56
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,304
- I'll take one.
- Mm. Make it two.

00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,973
I hate all of you and myself. Three.

58
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,976
I'll ring it up.

59
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,105
Like shooting nerds in a barrel.

60
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,551
Hey, can I talk to you about something?
It's a little awkward.

61
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,095
I know what this is about.

62
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,431
Given the professional standstill
you're at...

63
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,184
...you're wondering
if this is the appropriate time...

64
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,229
...to abandon your research
and focus on teaching.

65
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,901
Yes.

66
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,364
And if I may suggest,
consider changing disciplines.

67
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,450
Yeah, to the humanities.
Perhaps, history.

68
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,702
One of the advantages
of teaching history...

69
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,038
...is that you don't have
to create things.

70
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,999
You know, you just have to remember
stuff that happened...

71
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,377
...and then parrot it back.

72
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,379
You could have fun with that.

73
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,215
Yeah, that's not it.

74
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,676
Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.

75
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,095
Well, of course, he is.
She's very interesting.

76
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,222
Did you know, when she was 14...

77
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,933
...she severed the webbing
between her own toes?

78
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,062
No. Uh...

79
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,150
He wanted me to find out if you'd have
a problem with him asking her out.

80
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,155
Well, I'm not sure how to respond,
Leonard.

81
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,702
I mean, I don't own Amy.
You can't own a person.

82
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,663
At least, not since...

83
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,961
1863.

84
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,173
President Lincoln freed the...

85
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,387
The slaves. Come on, Leonard,
if you're gonna teach history...

86
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,015
...these are the kind of facts
you'll have to know.

87
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,102
You know what? Never mind.
I'm gonna tell him it's okay to ask her out.

88
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,355
The question is moot.
There is no way that Stuart...

89
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,691
...an impoverished peddler
of picture books...

90
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,485
...would be at all appealing
to Amy Farrah Fowler...

91
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,237
...a noted neurobiologist...

92
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,865
...capable of performing surgery
on her own feet...

93
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:29,828
...with nothing but nitrous oxide from
cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.

94
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,539
All right, but for the record...

95
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,375
...I checked in with you
to see how you'd feel about it.

96
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,003
Fine. The record shall so reflect.

97
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,255
Now, getting back
to the problem at hand...

98
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,800
...what to do with a washed-up
experimental physicist.

99
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,013
I am not washed-up.

100
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,515
Oh, Leonard.

101
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,101
Lots of people love you
and want to help you...

102
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,396
...but they can't
until you admit the problem.

103
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,985
Ugh. Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.

104
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,946
- I had half a glass.
- I didn't have any.

105
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,782
Okay, don't judge me.

106
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,161
So, what do you wanna do?
Go to the movies, go dancing...

107
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,163
...lay down for a little bit? Ahem.

108
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,833
Or we play...

109
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,460
...Travel Twister.

110
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,880
Amy, really? Twister?

111
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,258
Excuse me, I've passed many
an enjoyable evening playing this game.

112
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,762
And I'm sure it's a lot more exciting
when you play with other people.

"Hi. It's Stuart.
We met at the comic book store.

124
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,639
I was wondering if you'd like to get
coffee sometime. It's okay if you say no.

125
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,935
It might be the kick in the pants I need
to start taking Zoloft."

Just working it under all those layers
of wool and polyester.

What are you gonna do?
Doesn't he know you have a boyfriend?

129
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,241
Oh, she doesn't have a boyfriend,
she has a Sheldon.

130
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,828
- So do you like Stuart?
- I don't know.

131
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,748
He's nice. He's funny.
He has the sallow-drawn countenance...

132

...associated with an overactive
thyroid gland. That's kind of hot.

Look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but
you've been with him over a year now.

Yeah, I guess they're not engaged

look around too. Lot of options out there.
