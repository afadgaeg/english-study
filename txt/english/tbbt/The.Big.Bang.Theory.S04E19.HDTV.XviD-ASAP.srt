1
00:00:01,883 --> 00:00:06,203
Why hast thou forsaken me, O
deity whose existence I doubt?

2
00:00:07,538 --> 00:00:10,540
Here. Breathe
into this bag.

3
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:13,026
What's going on?

4
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:15,696
They stole everything, Leonard!

5
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:17,130
Everything.

6
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:18,882
Are you the roommate?

7
00:00:18,883 --> 00:00:20,967
Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter.
What happened?

8
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:23,203
Your friend here called 911
to report a robbery.

9
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:25,138
Oh, my God,
what did they get?

10
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:26,423
What didn't they get?

11
00:00:26,424 --> 00:00:28,375
They got my enchanted weapons,

12
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,344
my vicious gladiator armor,

13
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:32,679
my wand of untainted power,

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,649
and all my gold!

15
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,451
You called the police

16
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:40,220
because someone hacked your
World of Warcraft account?

17
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:42,656
What choice did I have?

18
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:45,859
The mighty Sheldor,
level 85 blood elf,

19
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,661
hero of the Eastern kingdoms,

20
00:00:47,662 --> 00:00:51,865
has been picked clean, like
a carcass in the desert sun.

21
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:54,735
Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

22
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:58,672
Into the bag.

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,676
They took my battle ostrich!

24
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:05,011
- Oh, no, not Glenn!
- Yes!

25
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:06,346
Glenn!

26
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:08,548
The only bird I ever loved.

27
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:11,852
Good luck, fellas.

28
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:13,553
Oh. Well, thank you, officer.

29
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:14,821
Wait a minute!

30
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:16,323
You're not going to do anything?

31
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:17,491
Mr. Cooper,
there's nothing...

32
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:18,992
Dr. Cooper.

33
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:21,561
Seriously?

34
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:25,432
Not the kind with
access to drugs.

35
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,402
Fine. Dr. Cooper.

36
00:01:28,403 --> 00:01:29,836
I'm sorry for your loss,

37
00:01:29,837 --> 00:01:31,371
but the Pasadena
Police Department

38
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:33,607
doesn't have
jurisdiction in...

39
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:35,509
Pandora.

40
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,178
That's from <i>Avatar!</i>

41
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,515
World of Warcraft
takes place in Azeroth.

42
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:44,384
Goodness gracious, how are you
allowed to carry a gun?

43
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:49,523
Can you at least refer me
to a rogue ex-cop?

44
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:50,857
What?

45
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:53,660
Wh-- you know, one who was
drummed off the force

46
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:55,495
because he refused
to play by the rules,

47
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:57,197
and now he hires himself out

48
00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:00,400
to impose his own brand
of rough justice?

49
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:03,136
No.

50
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:06,189
Thank you, officer.

51
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:09,709
It's all gone. <i>All</i> gone.

52
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,578
I'm really
sorry, Sheldon.

53
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:13,246
What kind of world
do we live in,

54
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:17,184
where a man would take
another man's battle ostrich?

55
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:19,085
I don't know.

56
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:21,455
This act of aggression
must be met

57
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:23,824
with swift and cruel ferocity.

58
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:28,462
It is time to cry havoc,
and let slip the dogs of war.

59
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:30,630
I'm on it.

60
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:36,736
Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz.
Is, is Howard there?

61
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,906
Okay, thanks.

62
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:41,408
That particular dog of war

63
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,510
will have to call you back
after his bath.

64
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:49,249

75
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:16,980
Three thousand hours.

76
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:20,116
Three thousand hours
clicking on that mouse,

77
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,085
collecting weapons and gold.

78
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:26,957
It's almost as if it was
a huge waste of time.

79
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,592
Whoever did this
knew what they were doing.

80
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:30,627
He got in and out
of your account in under

81
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:33,129
15 minutes, transferred
all your stuff,

82
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,364
and didn't leave
a digital fingerprint.

83
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:35,599
Oh!

84
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,168
There isn't enough
chamomile tea in the world

85
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:41,071
to quell the rage in my heart.

86
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:43,773
Hold on. I'm talking to an orc

87
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:45,342
under the bridge
in Thunder Bluff

88
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:48,178
who says if we pay him, he'll
help us track down your things.

89
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,679
Can we trust him?

90
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,982
I should say so;
he appears to be a member

91
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,518
of the Nigerian royal family.

92
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,389
Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off
a jeweled ostrich bridle!

93
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,024
No. Glenn's was leather.

94
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:04,060
He was a simple ostrich.

95
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:07,063
Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.

96
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:09,833
Hey.

97
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,068
Hey, Penny. We're kind of in
the middle of a crisis, here.

98
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:14,437
Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

99
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:17,774
Sorry, Sheldon. I know
that game meant a lot to you.

100
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:19,843
What-- "that game"?

101
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:24,781
Excuse me, Penny, but
Doodle Jump is a game.

102
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:27,450
Angry Birds is a game.

103
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:28,919
World of Warcraft is a

104
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,089
massively multi-player
online role-playing...

105
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,025
all right,
technically it's a game.

106
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,063
Bad news, the Nigerian prince
may be a fraud.

107
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:42,298
Okay, well, anyways,
I brought you

108
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,850
a day-old cheesecake
to cheer you up!

109
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,436
Stale pastry
is hollow succor

110
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:48,905
to a man who is
bereft of ostrich.

111
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:51,207
Just say "thank you."

112
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,777
I thought I just did.

113
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:57,614
All right. See you later.

114
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:58,715
Oh! Hello.

115
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,951
Oh, hi! I was just
dropping off a cheesecake

116
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:04,120
to Sheldon. He was robbed
of a bunch of imaginary crap

117
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,723
that's useful in
a make-believe place.

118
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:09,059
I don't know what that means.

119
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,895
Yeah, well,
sadly, I do.

120
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:16,099
Did you know last weekend
Priya took Leonard

121
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,500
rollerblading
at the beach?

122
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:19,269
Can you believe that?

123
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,222
I feel like I'm supposed
to say "that bitch,"

124
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:24,774
but I don't have
enough information.

125
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:27,143
I am the one who
spent two years

126
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:28,345
trying to get him to even

127
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:29,980
go to the beach
in the first place.

128
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,032
And he was so phobic about
stepping on medical waste,

129
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,950
I had to carry him
to the water.

130
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:36,653
I took Howard to the beach once.

131
00:05:36,654 --> 00:05:39,723
He almost burst into flames
like a vampire.

132
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,877
So what's the thanks
I get for turning Leonard

133
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,578
into quality boyfriend material?

134
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,764
I have to tiptoe around
his new girlfriend.

135
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,417
I think you're on.
Oh.

136
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:53,670
That bitch!

137
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:56,439
Want some coffee liqueur
on your ice cream?

138
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,342
Ah, here's the alcohol
and drug peer pressure

139
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:00,844
Mother warned me about.

140
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:04,681
I was starting to think
it was never going to happen.

141
00:06:04,682 --> 00:06:07,417
Yes, please.

142
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:09,119
You guys should've seen Leonard
when I first met him.

143
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
There was no eye contact.

144
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:11,521
He was either looking
up at the ceiling,

145
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:13,189
or down at his shoes.

146
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,125
I'm drunk.

147
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:18,912
You know, for the
first couple of months,

148
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,730
whenever I would
take off my bra,

149
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:25,568
he would giggle and say,
"Oh, boy, my breast friends!"

150
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,804
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

151
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,773
I'm never speaking
to Priya again.

152
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:30,840
No, don't do that.

153
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:32,392
No reason to be mean to her.

154
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:35,812
This may be the
alcohol talking...

155
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,047
but I believe there is.

156
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:39,215
Are you familiar
with the recent study

157
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:41,651
of Tanzanian chimpanzees
by Nishida and Hosaka

158
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,887
out of Kyoto University?

159
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:47,123
No, but I can name
all the Kardashians.

160
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:50,026
Primates, such as ourselves,
have a natural instinct

161
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:52,629
to ostracize ill-mannered
members of the troop.

162
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,963
Bernadette's urge to

163
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:56,800
shun, scowl or
fling her waste at Priya

164
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:59,035
is hard-wired into her DNA.

165
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:02,939
I don't have an urge
to fling my waste.

166
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,275
Believe me, it's there,
we all have it.

167
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:08,445
Hit me with some more booze,
and I'll show you.

168
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,882
All right, here we are--
this is the tavern

169
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:16,553
where all the black-market
weapon trades go down.

170
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:19,355
I don't think my character
should be in a place like this.

171
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,558
Everyone's undressing
her with their eyes.

172
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,727
Maybe if you stop
dropping your sword

173
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:25,962
and bending over to pick it up.

174
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,015
Okay, what exactly
are we looking for?

175
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,101
Redheaded troll,
goes by the name of Glumly.

176
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:32,135
According to the
message boards,

177
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:33,670
if you want to
move stolen goods

178
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:35,805
and it's after school
hours, he's your guy.

179
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:37,073
Leonard,
is this going

180
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:38,875
to take much longer?
I thought we were

181
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,276
going to spend
some time together.

182
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:41,711
Uh, we are.
In the meantime,

183
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,514
you're welcome to whip up
a quick character and join us.

184
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:46,082
Seriously?

185
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,685
Well, you have to put
in a credit card number,

186
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:50,653
but it's fun.

187
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:52,422
Maybe I should just go home.

188
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:53,923
Our troll just walked
in! I got him!

189
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:55,759
We got him.
We're almost done.

190
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
So, how do

191
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:58,044
you guys want
to play this?

192
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,596
Be ruthless.
You tell him

193
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,898
if he doesn't start talking,
we'll register a complaint

194
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,801
with his Internet
service provider.

195
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:08,271
<i>Sheldon,</i> what if he gets his
Internet from his cable company?

196
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:13,209
He could lose his HBO and all their
delightful original programming.

197
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,546
I don't care!
I'm losin' it, man!

198
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:18,014
Why don't we play this smart?

199
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:20,316
Try a little
"good goblin, bad goblin."

200
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,385
Oh, dear Lord.

201
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:24,654
Nah, I think we have
to be more subtle.

202
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:27,624
Okay, I see where
this is going.

203
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,193
Fine, I'll have
sex with him.

204
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:35,298
That's not where it was going.

205
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,622
Good, because
I would hate that.

206
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:42,062
Leonard, you're busy--
let's talk tomorrow.

207
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,263
Oh, wait.

208
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:46,092
- Hang on. Are you upset?
- No, no, I think

209
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,611
it's sexy to date a boy
trapped in a man's body.

210
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:49,612
Oh.

211
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,613
Good, good.

212
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,316
I'll tell you
what happens.

213
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:57,220
And people think <i>I</i>
don't get sarcasm.

214
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:03,359
Well, well, well.

215
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:05,912
Look who it is.

216
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:06,996
Okay, be nice.

217
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,198
Hello.

218
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,116
Hi. We're just
heading out for a drink.

219
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:13,136
Because I do that now.

220
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,171
Count your blessings

221
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:17,340
you're not a Tanzanian chimp.

222
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,509
What?

223
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,460
Don't listen to her--

224
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:22,378
she's had a lot
of ice cream.

225
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,314
Do you want to join us?

226
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,983
Oh, thank you,
but I have work to do.

227
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:31,554
Four women walk
down the stairs--

228
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:34,140
how many reach the lobby?

229
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:41,573
Did your sister say anything
when you got home last night?

230
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:43,925
Oh, no, don't put me
in the middle of this.

231
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:45,593
I'm not going to
be your go-between.

232
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:46,761
Come on, help me out.

233
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:48,162
Am I in trouble?

234
00:09:48,163 --> 00:09:50,114
There's no
reason to worry.

235
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:51,266
That's a relief.

236
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,467
I'm sure
many women

237
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,402
in happy relationships
spend their nights

238
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:56,804
Skyping with their
ex-boyfriend Sanjay.

239
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:02,377
Good news, gentlemen--
I found our hacker.

240
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:03,711
- What?
- Really?

241
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:05,579
Yeah. No one can hide from me,

242
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,265
not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego,

243
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:09,484
not even topless
Natalie Portman.

244
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,320
I've never said
these words before,

245
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,722
but good job, Howard!

246
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:20,228
Thanks. Our culprit
is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711

247
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:21,429
Ocean View Road,

248
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,997
Carlsbad, California.

249
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:26,000
The name and the address
drip with evil.

250
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,335
What else do we know about him?

251
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,153
Why, quite a
bit, actually.

252
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:32,373
I'll bet he's some loser
who lives with his parents.

253
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,547
Yes, he does live
with his parents.

254
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:43,851
Here's a Google Earth
shot of their house.

255
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,820
Excellent!
It's in a cul-de-sac.

256
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:46,988
We can box him in.

257
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:49,891
Hold on, you're thinking
of going there?

258
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:52,226
Carlsbad is only
a couple of hours away.

259
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:53,344
Fine.

260
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:55,296
You walk up to the house,
knock on the door

261
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:57,298
and demand your stuff back.
What if he says no?

262
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:59,534
I don't know if you've been
following the news, Leonard,

263
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,336
but there have been
some terrific advancements

264
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:02,937
in the field of torture.

265
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,407
No one's getting tortured.

266
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:08,643
Fine, we'll abide by
the Geneva Convention.

267
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:10,078
But ask yourself this:

268
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,113
in the course
of our lives,

269
00:11:12,114 --> 00:11:14,449
how much lunch money
has been taken from us?

270
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,200
How many kites?

271
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,953
How many Scooby-Doo
Trapper Keepers?

272
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:21,089
I totally had one of those.

273
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,490
Of course you did.

274
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:25,026
It was a fun and practical way
of organizing your school work.

275
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:27,378
But the bullies
took it from us.

276
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:28,363
Well, no more.

277
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:30,531
Tonight, we take back
our dignity,

278
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:32,633
our birthright and our pride.

279
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:33,801
What do you say?

280
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:35,303
Who's with me?

281
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:43,177
I have a hip-hop aerobics class
at 5:00; could we go after?

282
00:11:43,178 --> 00:11:45,146
Sure.

283
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:47,014
Also, tonight's the Sabbath

284
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:48,583
and my mother and I
have a tradition of

285
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,785
lighting the candles and
watching <i>Wheel of Fortune,</i> so...

286
00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:51,819
If we could leave

287
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,121
at 8:00, we'd still be able to

288
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:54,722
regain our birthright
at 10:00, 10:30 latest.

289
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:56,824
Fine.

290
00:11:56,825 --> 00:11:59,127
Leonard?

291
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:01,796
Oh, geez, I-I don't know
if I can ditch Priya

292
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,131
two nights in a row.

293
00:12:03,132 --> 00:12:04,298
Oh, come on, man.

294
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:06,968
Bros before...

295
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:11,572
...my sister.

296
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,075
Aw, screw it.

297
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:15,209
I'm in.
Me, too.

298
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,078
And me.

299
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:20,098
One moment.

300
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:25,820
I'm hell-bent on catching
a cyber criminal,

301
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:28,072
not the common cold.

302
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:33,057
I'm sorry, I thought
this delay was

303
00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:35,660
so you could watch <i>Wheel of</i>
<i>Fortune</i> with your mother.

304
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:36,895
I am.

305
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,530
She's just bleaching
her mustache.

306
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:40,732
Check it out.

307
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,901
Hey, Ma!
"Before and After!"

308
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:46,337
Four words, 17 letters,
two N's, one V!

309
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:48,773
"Fanny pack of wolves!"

310
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:52,243
That's incredible.

311
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:53,912
Yeah, she's kind of
a <i>Wheel</i> savant.

312
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:57,849
Uh-oh, that's Priya.

313
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:02,520
Sitar music for her ringtone
is not cool, dude.

314
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:04,189
Hit the...

315
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:08,059
Hey, sweetie.

316
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,327
Yeah, I'm sorry.

317
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:11,229
I'm gonna be working late.

318
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:14,532
Yeah, I-I miss you, too.

319
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:17,535
Okay, sure, I'll call you
when I get home.

320
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,037
Okay, bye-bye.

321
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:20,305
Very nice.

322
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:22,106
You lie to my sister.

323
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,710
That's the nicest thing
he does to your sister.

324
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:34,552
Oh, guess who.

325
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:36,087
Cover for me.

326
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:39,424
Hello, Priya. What's up?

327
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:41,793
How would I know
if Leonard's at work or not?

328
00:13:41,794 --> 00:13:44,329
Don't be suspicious.

329
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,097
Look, if you want your
relationship with Leonard

330
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:47,765
to continue,
you're going to have to believe

331
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:49,534
whatever wild-eyed,
cockamamie excuse

332
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:51,769
the white devil
has the nerve to offer you.

333
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:56,508
Okay? Yeah, bye-bye.

334
00:13:57,476 --> 00:13:59,344
You owe me.

335
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:02,080
New puzzle, Ma!

336
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,381
"Same name"!

337
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:05,083
One N, two D's, three O's!

338
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:07,785
Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!

339
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:09,120
That's uncanny.

340
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:10,955
I know.
It's her superpower.

341
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:13,024
Well, that and jiggling
her arm fat.

342
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:18,429
I can't believe we're going
all the way to San Diego

343
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,198
to confront this guy.

344
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:22,834
Yeah, we're kind of
bad-asses, aren't we?

345
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:24,202
Totally.

346
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:26,070
Hey, how about
we stay the night

347
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:28,540
and hit Legoland
in the morning?

348
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,141
Sea World is better.

349
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:34,178
It has Shamu, who is
literally tons of fun.

350
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:37,448
But for the moment, let's stay
focused on Todd Zarnecki.

351
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:40,118
Yeah, we're coming for you,
Todd Zarnecki.

352
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:43,621
And for the record, Legoland
is more interactive.

353
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,690
I almost feel sorry

354
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:49,294
for the poor fool, sitting in
his split-level suburban ranch,

355
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:50,628
unaware that

356
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:54,332
a vengeful horde is barreling
down the San Diego Freeway

357
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,568
at 71 miles an hour.

358
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:58,035
Ease up there, lead foot.

359
00:14:58,036 --> 00:14:59,504
You trying to get us killed?

360
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,741
I took the liberty
of burning us

361
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:05,843
a mix of heroic
questing music.

362
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:11,115
This says "Beyonce
Bootylicious Dance Mix."

363
00:15:11,116 --> 00:15:12,784
It's a
re-writable CD.

364
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:14,719
Just put it in.

365
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,437
Beyonce? Really?

366
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:18,289
She's curvy and she owns it.

367
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,824
I like that.

368
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:30,234
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.

369
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:33,070
We are winged fury!

370
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:34,472
Which is still no excuse

371
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:36,374
for going over
the posted speed limit.

372
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:41,646
♪ ♪

373
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:44,182
Next time we go to
kick someone's ass,

374
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:45,783
we take the train.

375
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:49,220
I always prefer the train.

376
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:52,440
Sheldon, let's go.

377
00:15:53,425 --> 00:15:55,026
Coming.

378
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,964
Why did you bring that?

379
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:02,984
No weapon strikes more fear
into a man's heart

380
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:05,003
than a Klingon bat'leth.

381
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:08,156
Okay, let's get
clear on something.

382
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:10,241
We're just going to tell
this guy to transfer all of

383
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:13,044
your stuff back into your
account and then be on our way.

384
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:15,580
No one's bat'lething anybody.

385
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:19,450
So my blade shall not
taste blood tonight?

386
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:21,986
No.

387
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:25,590
Well, now I just feel silly
holding it.

388
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:27,258
Come on.

389
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,094
Can I at least
kick down the door?

390
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:32,563
You're welcome to try, but
the other day, it took you

391
00:16:32,564 --> 00:16:35,500
15 minutes to get
into a FedEx box.

392
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:40,038
Who is it?

393
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,839
Your doom!

394
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,141
Don't say "your doom."

395
00:16:43,142 --> 00:16:45,543
Who opens the door
for their doom?

396
00:16:45,544 --> 00:16:46,911
Good point.

397
00:16:46,912 --> 00:16:48,913
Basket of puppies.

398
00:16:51,517 --> 00:16:52,650
What?

399
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:54,318
Uh...

400
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:57,188
Sheldon?

401
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:01,359
Are you Todd Zarnecki?

402
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,994
Yeah. Who are you?

403
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:05,196
I am Sheldor of Azeroth.

404
00:17:05,197 --> 00:17:06,831
I want my things back.

405
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:07,965
I don't think so.

406
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:09,167
Let me see that.

407
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:10,468
Careful.
That's a collectible.

408
00:17:10,469 --> 00:17:11,552
I know.

409
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:15,139
I've always wanted one.

410
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:25,349
Well, he's even more cunning
than we thought.

411
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:31,622
You know, the joke's on him.

412
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:33,958
Without the certificate of
authenticity,

413
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:36,594
that bat'leth is worthless.

414
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:39,864
Yeah, he walked
right into our trap.

415
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:44,836
Legoland seems like
a hollow dream now.

416
00:17:46,004 --> 00:17:48,389
Uh-oh.

417
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,091
What's the matter?
Something's wrong.

418
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:51,743
I'm not getting any gas.

419
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:01,219
Anybody know anything about
internal combustion engines?

420
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,186
Of course.

421
00:18:02,187 --> 00:18:03,688
19th-century technology.
Very basic.

422
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:06,057
Does anybody know how to fix
an internal combustion engine?

423
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:08,493
No. No.
Not a clue.

424
00:18:08,494 --> 00:18:11,629
Well, we'd better call somebody
to come pick us up.

425
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,499
It'd be swell
if they had a train.

426
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:21,706
Thank you, Penny.

427
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:24,075
No problem.

428
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:25,610
So, Leonard,

429
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:27,678
I think it's interesting
you didn't call your girlfriend

430
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,880
to come get you.

431
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:31,349
Uh, I kind of
told her I was working.

432
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,184
So you lied to her.

433
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:35,052
Also interesting.

434
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:36,804
Yeah, she doesn't really
understand

435
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:39,757
the whole Warcraft
adventure-role-playing thing.

436
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:43,427
Well, doesn't matter if she gets
it, as long as she's pretty.

437
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:47,098
This one's funny,
Leonard.

438
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:49,534
How come you couldn't
make it work with her?

439
00:18:50,702 --> 00:18:53,304
So did you at least get
Sheldon's fake stuff back?

440
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:56,607
No. We failed
in our noble quest.

441
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:57,658
How come?

442
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:01,212
Todd Zarnecki was mean.

443
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:02,747
All right. Hang on.

444
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:04,182
What are you doing?

445
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:07,218
I'm gonna show you how we
finish a quest in Nebraska.

446
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:11,923
Oh. Beyonce.

447
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:20,731
This ain't no Beyonce.

448
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,737
Now what?

449
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,540
Give my friend his stuff back.

450
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,409
I don't know
what you're talking about.

451
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,877
Well, then, good news.

452
00:19:32,878 --> 00:19:34,912
Today's the day a girl's
finally going to touch you

453
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:36,313
in your little special place.

454
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:42,086
Now give him his stuff back.

455
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:43,621
Okay.

456
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:45,089
We did it!

457
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:49,510
I said, "we."

458
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:58,692
Oh, hold the door.

459
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:00,360
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

460
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,072
Going to see Leonard?

461
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:04,041
Yes.

462
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,392
How have you been?

463
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:06,777
Fine. You?

464
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:08,979
Very well, thank you.

465
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:40,377
-- sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> --

466
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:50,287
All right, well,
great seeing you.

467
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:52,489
Yeah. You, too.

468
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:55,960
Amy's right.

469
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:59,330
I do want
to fling my poop at her.
