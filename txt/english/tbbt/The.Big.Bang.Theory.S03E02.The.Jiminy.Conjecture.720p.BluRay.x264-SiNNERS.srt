1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:04,495
Sheldon, you're wrong.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,798
Wolverine was not born
with bone claws.

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,204
Howard, you know me to be
a very smart man.

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:13,176
Don't you think if I were wrong,
I'd know it?

5
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,046
- First of all...
- Give it up.

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,843
You're arguing with a crazy person.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,851
I'm not crazy.
My mother had me tested.

8
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,323
- Hey, guys.
- What are you doing here?

9
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,083
What? It's new-comic-book night.

10
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,757
Since you and Penny hooked up...

11
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:31,864
...we thought you two would be having
bouncy naked yum-yum night.

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,690
There's more to life than sex, Raj.

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,893
Who had Leonard flames out
in 24 hours?

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,731
I did.

15
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,501
Nothing flamed out.

16
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,767
We don't have to have sex
every night.

17
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:46,435
You don't have to,
but it's highly recommended.

18
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,945
Take advantage
of that window of opportunity...

19
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,210
...before it slams shut
on your little dinky.

20
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,213
It's not a matter of opportunity.

21
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,221
We're getting to know each other.
There's a learning curve.

22
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,757
What's to learn?
You get naked, do nasty things.

23
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:03,021
Then somebody makes scrambled eggs
and salami. Easy-peasy.

24
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,896
Perhaps what Leonard
is obliquely referring to...

25
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,398
...is the occurrence
of sexual dysfunction.

26
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,060
Okay, who had
Leonard gets a floppy disk?

27
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:15,402
Oh. A clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism
for insufficient blood flow...

28
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,873
...to the male sex organ.

29
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,438
Nothing like that happened, all right?
The sex was just fine.

30
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,145
Just fine?

31
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,619
<i>Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Pottermovie
was just fine.</i>

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,250
I'm not saying it was bad.
I'm just saying it wasn't great.

33
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,986
Okay, you mean for both of you?

34
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:39,394
Because we can totally see it
not being great for her. Am I right?

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,927
To tell you the truth, I think
we were both a little... I don't know...

36
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,437
- Disappointed? Let down?
- Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?

37
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,736
All I know is
it wasn't the way I dreamed it would be.

38
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,512
Sex is never the way
I dream it's gonna be.

39
00:01:56,283 --> 00:02:00,242
That's because in your dreams,
you're a horse from the waist down.

40
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:06,859
<i>Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin
Miniseries Issue 2, page 22.</i>

41
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,154
Retractable bone claws.

42
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,425
If you spent less time thinking about sex
and more time on comic books...

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,865
...we'd have far fewer
of these embarrassing moments.

44
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,891
Sheldon, dinner's here.

45
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,396
Tandoori Palace?

46
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,295
No, we went somewhere new.

47
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,634
You're good-naturedly ribbing me,
aren't you?

48
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,736
No, look, Mumbai Palace.

49
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,344
Why? Why would we change?

50
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:04,245
We had a perfectly good palace.
Tandoori Palace is our palace.

51
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,818
Trust me, this will be just fine.

52
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,251
You are the authority on just fine.

53
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,056
What's that supposed to mean?

54
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,695
Exactly. Not bad, but not great.

55
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,427
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know.

56
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,059
- I know. As I'm sure you're aware...
- Dut! Dut-dut-dut-dut!

57
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,101
If that's Morse code, that's terrible.

58
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,333
As I was saying, you and Leonard
had a disappointing sexual encounter.

59
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,606
Earlier this evening,
Leonard characterized it as, "Just fine."

60
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,274
So, what you're seeing is a continuation
of the mocking that followed.

61
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,956
Okay. Yeah, well, I'm just gonna go eat
my dinner elsewhere.

62
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,219
Maybe an airplane headed
for a mountainside.

63
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,358
Penny, wait. Aah.

64
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,098
What is wrong with you?

65
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,637
I sense I may have crossed
some sort of line.

66
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,640
- Yeah, you...
- Don't tell him.

67
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,643
Let's see if he can figure it out.

68
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,310
- Ugh. I am so embarrassed.
- Please don't be mad.

69
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,319
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing bad.

70
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,481
Just that last night was fine.

71
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,819
Fine? You said it was fine?

72
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,655
Yeah. It's a perfectly good word.

73
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:27,232
You put it in front of "wine" or "dining"
and you've really got something.

74
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:35,336
Okay, well, let me ask you this,
how was last night for you?

75
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,567
It was...

76
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,177
...okay.

77
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,177
Okay?

78
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,179
Yeah, it's a perfectly good word.

79
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,514
I mean, you put it in front of "dokay"
and you really got something.

80
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,122
All right, let's not overreact.

81
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,123
It takes time
to get to know each other's rhythms.

82
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,523
Learn what the other person wants
and likes.

83
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,858
- So you've been through this before?
- No.

84
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,698
Okay-dokay.

85
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,138
This is one of those things where talking
about it is not gonna make it better.

86
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,539
- Want a glass of wine? Okay.
- So much.

87
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,043
See, we should've done this last night,
you know?

88
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,375
Had a little wine, take the edge off.

89
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,213
Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits
electrical conduction in the nerve cells...

90
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:23,550
...and stimulates reuptake receptors
of inhibitory neurotransmitters...

91
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,283
...like gamma-aminobutyric acid.

92
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,230
Don't talk. Just drink.

93
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,965
No, you're misunderstanding.

94
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,628
A shiksa goddess
isn't an actual goddess.

95
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,643
We don't pray to them.
We prey on them.

96
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,243
Whatever, dude. The point is
Leonard's got one and you don't.

97
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,678
Is this it?

98
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,014
It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard
and Penny's sex life...

99
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,813
...in front of Leonard and Penny.

100
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,982
Good.

101
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:01,985
Now I can eat.

102
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,169
- What's that?
- Sounds like a cricket.

103
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,999
Hang on.

104
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,102
Based on the number of chirps
per minute and the temperature...

105
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,612
...it is a snowy tree cricket.

106
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:27,617
Oh. Give me a fricking break.
How could you possibly know that?

107
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,348
In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined
there was a fixed relationship...

108
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,119
...between the number of chirps per
minute and the ambient temperature.

109
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:39,129
A precise relationship that is not present
with ordinary field crickets.

110
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,563
How do you know the temperature
of this room?

111
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,635
Under the terms of my roommate
agreement I've had control...

112
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,205
...of the thermostat
ever since the sweaty night of '06.

113
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,138
Okay, you were right about Wolverine
and bone claws...

114
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,143
...but you're wrong about the cricket.

115
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:58,978
Howard, don't embarrass yourself.
The science chirps for itself.

116
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,880
Humorous word play.

117
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,386
No, no. Not this time.
I know insects, my friend.

118
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,585
I spent many childhood years capturing
them with nets, putting them in jars...

119
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,096
...sticking pins through them, mounting
them on cardboard with labels...

120
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,292
...identifying the genus and species.

121
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,437
In Latin.

122
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,837
Oh. Dude, you are never getting
a shiksa goddess.

123
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:30,748
<i>That is a snowy tree cricket.
Oecanthus fultoni.</i>

124
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,011
I was done with Latin by fifth grade.

125
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,613
Okay. Tell you what.

126
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,848
I am willing to bet anything
that's an ordinary field cricket.

127
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,654
- I can't take your money.
- What's the matter, you chicken?

128
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,525
I've always found that
an inappropriate slur.

129
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,428
Chickens are not at all timid.

130
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,763
In fact, when I was young,
my neighbor's chicken got loose...

131
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,963
...and chased me up the big elm tree
in front of our house.

132
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,877
- Chickens can't climb trees.
- Thank God.

133
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,282
Okay, I believe a chicken made you
his bitch.

134
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,615
The cricket thing, I don't buy. Bet me.

135
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,718
Fair enough.

136
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,358
What stakes do you propose?

137
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,885
<i>I will put up
my Fantastic Four Number 48...</i>

138
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,963
...first appearance of Silver Surfer...

139
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:23,068
<i>...against your Flash 123,
the classic "Flash of Two Worlds" issue.</i>

140
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,168
All right, you have a wager.

141
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,734
Hmm.

142
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,068
Great.
Now, how are you gonna settle it? Hmm?

143
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,737
There is no way to determine the species
of the cricket without examining it.

144
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,982
I wonder what the non-pathetic people
are doing tonight.

145
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,596
- More wine?
- Hit me.

146
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,443
- I don't see anything.
- Shh.

147
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,617
Hallway.

148
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,452
Ahh.

149
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,061
One at a time.

150
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,465
What was that?

151
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,474
My stomach.

152
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,639
Indian food doesn't agree with me.

153
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,083
Ironic, isn't it?

154
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,584
Elevator shaft.

155
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,727
Help me open it.

156
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,263
Are you crazy? We can't go down
an empty elevator shaft.

157
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,095
If you don't wanna proceed,
then you forfeit the bet...

158
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,238
<i>...and I'll take possession
of your Fantastic Four.</i>

159
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,964
Let's open her up.

160
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,672
Are you bothered
that I can so easily manipulate you?

161
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,245
Don't push me, Sheldon.

162
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,676
I may be small,
but I took kung fu when I was 13...

163
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,411
...and I remember a good deal of it.

164
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,679
Oh, really?

165
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:25,188
I grew up with an older brother
and a very contentious twin sister.

166
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,191
And I could easily best you
in any physical confrontation.

167
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:32,024
Be it noogies, swirlies or the classic,
"Why are you hitting yourself?"

168
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:38,300
Ooh. Big talk from a man who was once
treed by a chicken.

169
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,204
- Ahem.
- What are we drinking now?

170
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,112
Peppermint schnapps.

171
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,384
Why would you
buy peppermint schnapps?

172
00:10:55,555 --> 00:11:00,458
Because I like peppermint
and it's fun to say "schnapps."

173
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,292
- Hey, Leonard?
- What?

174
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,489
Schnapps.

175
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,329
Schnapps.

176
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:13,062
You're right, that is fun.

177
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,906
Be careful.

178
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,737
If I were not being careful...

179
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:23,246
...your telling me to be careful
would not make me careful.

180
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,586
Stairwell.

181
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:33,088
Uh-oh. Flashlight went out.
I need some batteries.

182
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,756
Fellas?

183
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,428
Hello?

184
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,767
It's really dark down here.

185
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:54,374
Oh, sweetie, you really can't hold
your liquor, can you?

186
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,843
I'm okay.

187
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:00,952
Just a little mouthwash
and then I'm gonna rock your world.

188
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,952
Are you okay?

189
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:21,897
Oh. Toby, what did you do in a past life
to be so disgusting now?

190
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,205
His name isn't Toby.

191
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,470
Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.

192
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:29,274
- What would you name him?
- An appropriate cricket name.

193
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,610
For example, Jiminy.

194
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,252
All right, Sheldon, here we go.

195
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,911
<i>Kleingast's Field Guide
to North American Insects.</i>

196
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,614
Hey, Toby.

197
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,226
Right here.

198
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,420
<i>See it? "The common field cricket,
a.k.a. Gryllus assimilis"...</i>

199
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,827
...which is Latin for "suck it, you lose."

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,934
Hang on.

201
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,899
<i>Voil�. "The snowy tree cricket,
a.k.a. Oecanthus fultoni"...</i>

202
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,439
...which is Latin for "I'll suck nothing."

203
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,435
<i>Of course, I'm joking, because the Latin
for that is "nihil exsorbibo."</i>

204
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,071
That is not Toby, this is Toby.

205
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,774
Raj, what do you think?

206
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,617
Oh. I really don't care anymore.

207
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:14,020
- God, I had the most horrible night.
- What happened?

208
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:18,186
Obviously another carnal fiasco
with the "shiksi" goddess.

209
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,854
Shiksa. Shiksa.

210
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:24,094
Forgive me.
Yiddish was not spoken in East Texas.

211
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,364
And if it was,
it wasn't spoken for long.

212
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,600
Yeah, fine, whatever.
The point is you're wrong, again.

213
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,041
We haven't established
that I'm wrong once.

214
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,680
Let's go down
to the Entomology Department...

215
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:39,011
...and let Professor Crawley tell us
what kind of cricket Toby is.

216
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,983
He's a snowy tree cricket.
And his name is Jiminy.

217
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:47,486
I bet I could throw a rock in this room
and come up with three better friends.

218
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,327
Holy crap.

219
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,874
<i>It's like Silence of the Lambs
down here.</i>

220
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,215
Don't do that.

221
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,310
Don't be such a girl. They're just bugs.

222
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,819
I don't like bugs, okay?
They freak me out.

223
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,081
Interesting.

224
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,589
You're afraid of insects and women.

225
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,093
Ladybugs must render you catatonic.

226
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,326
It was a joke.

227
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,201
I made it to lessen your discomfort.

228
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,839
You're welcome.

229
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,410
Ha-ha. Don't knock. Just walk in.

230
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:46,416
Why be polite to the world's leading
expert on the dung beetle?

231
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,854
Excuse me,
are you Professor Crawley?

232
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,914
Who wants to know?

233
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,393
I'm Dr. Cooper,
from the Physics Department.

234
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,052
- Couldn't wait, huh?
- I'm sorry?

235
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,758
I haven't even packed yet
and you're already measuring my lab...

236
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,903
...for one
of your godless laser machines.

237
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,569
No, you don't understand.
We just wanna ask you a question.

238
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,441
Let me ask you one first.

239
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,706
What's a world-renowned entomologist
with a doctorate...

240
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,544
...and 20 years of experience,
to do with his life...

241
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:22,381
...when the university cuts off
the funding for his lab, huh?

242
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:27,050
Ask rhetorical questions
that make people uncomfortable?

243
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,760
What's your deal?

244
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,459
Are they planning to outsource my job
to Bangalore?

245
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,496
I'm from New Delhi.

246
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,272
- We should find another entomologist.
- We're here. Let's settle this.

247
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,105
Professor,
can you identify our cricket?

248
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,303
Of course I can.

249
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,246
I can identify every insect
and arachnid on the planet.

250
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,682
Not that that's gonna keep me from
having to move in with my daughter...

251
00:15:54,854 --> 00:16:00,019
...in Oxnard. And we're not talking
Oxnard at the beach. No.

252
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:04,289
We're talking Oxnard
in the onion fields.

253
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:11,034
- Well, could you look at Toby?
- Toby?

254
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,129
What a stupid name for a cricket.

255
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,136
Told you.

256
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,835
It's a field cricket.

257
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,104
- Yes.
- No, wait.

258
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,009
Dr. Crawley, are you sure?

259
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,811
Young man, I've been studying insects
since I was 8 years old.

260
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,819
You know what they used to call me
in school?

261
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,786
Creepy Crawley.

262
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,685
Cruel as that may be,
that is not in itself a credential.

263
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,996
Let me show you something.

264
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,858
See that?
That's a Crawley's dung beetle.

265
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,128
I discovered it after spending
six months...

266
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,534
...slogging through
the Bornean rain forests...

267
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,074
...while my wife was back home...

268
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,575
...shacking up
with a two-bit ornithologist...

269
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:57,512
...who lives on a sailboat
and likes to wear boot-cut jeans.

270
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:03,148
So when I tell you
that that's a common field cricket...

271
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,688
...you can take that
to the damn bank.

272
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,485
Because God knows I can't.

273
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,220
That tramp took me for everything.

274
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,703
Well, apparently I was wrong.

275
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,869
Congratulations.

276
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,546
Enjoy Oxnard.

277
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,417
I'm sure your daughter's looking forward
to having you.

278
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,222
Oh, hey, Sheldon.
What you got there? New comic book?

279
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,364
Old comic book.

280
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,932
I just retrieved it
from my safe-deposit box.

281
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,395
What do you have
a safe-deposit box for?

282
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,739
Old comic books.

283
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:59,567
I lost this to Wolowitz
in an ill-considered cricket wager.

284
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,236
What, do they have Wii cricket now?

285
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,784
That can't be very popular.

286
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,981
Penny, I'd rather not talk about it.

287
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:12,147
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'm not feeling so hot either.

288
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,752
Why would that make me feel better?

289
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,285
I don't know, empathy?

290
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,167
I'm just saying that you're feeling upset
about something with Howard...

291
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,272
...and I'm upset about something
with Leonard.

292
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,431
Yes, the disappointing sex.

293
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,974
That's an inexact parallel.

294
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,772
You and Leonard can always return
to being friends.

295
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,280
I can never return to a state
in which Wolowitz has not bested me...

296
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,113
...like Mrs. Riley's chicken.

297
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,278
What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?

298
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,455
A chicken that was owned
by Mrs. Riley.

299
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,188
- Okay, forget the chicken.
- I wish I could.

300
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,095
No, no.
You may be right about me and Leonard.

301
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:59,260
Well, of course I'm right. What are the
odds I'd be wrong twice in one week?

302
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,100
No, I mean,
we can always go back to being friends.

303
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,142
I just said that... This conversation
has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.

304
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,182
- Hello.
- Hey.

305
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,217
What's going on?

306
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,847
Oh, you'd like to catch up
on the events of the day. All right.

307
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,791
Well, there was a half-hour wait at the
bank to get into my safe-deposit box.

308
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,692
I was forced to talk to Penny
about your sexual problems.

309
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:29,062
And, oh, yes, in a moment filled
with biblical resonance...

310
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:30,896
...pride wenteth before my fall...

311
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,063
<i>...causing my Flash 123
to goeth to Wolowitz.</i>

312
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,874
Wait a minute.
You talked to Penny about our sex life?

313
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:42,481
Leonard, it astonishes me
how you continually fixate on the trivial.

314
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,515
I lost a bet to Wolowitz.

315
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,818
- You're saying you talked to Penny?
- Yes.

316
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,355
- Interesting.
- Hardly.

317
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,856
Excuse me.

318
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,926
Have I crossed
some sort of line again?

319
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,585
Little bit.

320
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,555
Hmm.

321
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,101
Oh. Who cares?

322
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,874
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, what did Sheldon say to you?

323
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:20,280
Not a lot. That we always have the
option of going back to being friends.

324
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,588
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know.

325
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,280
I mean, you have to admit...

326
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,222
...things seemed simpler
when we were just friends.

327
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,088
I guess.

328
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,963
- It would take the pressure off.
- It would, wouldn't it?

329
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,228
So we'll just be friends.

330
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,803
Good. Good.

331
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,196
Come here.

332
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,149
Okay-dokay.
