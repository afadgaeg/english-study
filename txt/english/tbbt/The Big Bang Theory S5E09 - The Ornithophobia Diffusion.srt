Star Wars on Blu-ray.

Not on Blu-ray.

Only twice on Blu-ray.

- What do you mean?

You know, we haven't spent time alone
together since we broke up.

17

It's not a date, Leonard.
It's a man and a woman hanging out...

you're afraid of birds?

30
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,880
It's called ornithophobia, and someday it
will be recognized as a true disability...

93

No, you always picked
and it was always the same.

...until the woman turns around
and realizes love was here all along.

Come on, that is a great movie.
And it starts in ten minutes.

But I hate those movies.

00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,355
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

99
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,609

how often would you pretend...

103
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,662
...to like things
just to have sex with me?

Okay. We were going out.
You were gonna get sex anyway.

Really? You would've slept with me after
a three hour documentary on dams?

113

No. No woman would.

114

See, now, that's the great thing.
We're out as friends.

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,241

I really don't get your problem
with birds.

130
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:48,175
The question you should be asking is,
what is their problem with me?

131
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,429
My first memory, a hummingbird
dive-bombing my stroller...

132

...to get at the apple juice
in my sippy cup.

Hummingbirds are pretty.

Hummingbirds are the vampires
of the flower world.

Still my first choice
for an ankle tattoo.

Age 7, a blood-thirsty chicken
chases me up a tree.

Age 12, a magpie tries to steal
the retainer out of my mouth.

Age 16, a parrot in a pet store
calls me fat ass.

00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,998
- All right. I'd like an order of fries.
- Great. That'll be 5 dollars.

164
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,335
I am having the best time.

165
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,213
I'm so glad you suggested we do this.

166
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,217
- Oh. Sorry.
- No problem.

167
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,846
- What you writing there?
- Uh, a screenplay.

168
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,099
It's about a guy whose roommate is
having sex and tells him to go...

169
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,518
...and work on his screenplay.

170

171
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,942

- Oh. Ha, ha.

172
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,277
- I'm Kevin.
- Oh, Penny.

173
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,570
Nice to meet you.

174
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,032
- I'll let you get back to your date.
- Oh, no, no. This isn't a date. No.

175
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,993
Right?

176
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,704
Uh, right.

177
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,165
So have you written anything
I might have seen?

178
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,876
That depends.

This isn't a terrifying bird

184
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,734
It's just a blue jay.

185
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,533
That's a pretty big blue jay.

186
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,263

No!

191
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,740
So it is an amazing documentary.

192
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,618
They need electricity from the dam...

193

they wanna preserve the environment.

195
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,465
- Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?
- Oh, sure. Just one sec?

196
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,259
No problem.

197
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,845
- What's up?
- I know what you're doing.

198
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,055
- What?
- You're going to talk to that guy...

199
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,475
- ...because I said we weren't on a date.
- I'm talking to him because he's cute.

200
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,395
- Uh, come on. He's not that cute.
- Yes, he is...

201
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,898
...with his dorky T-shirt
and his little hipster glasses.

202
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,157
I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.

203
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:26,494
Yes, but when you're tall and have great
cheekbones, you're doing it ironically.

204
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,916
- So, what if I start talking to a girl?
- You should.

205
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,753
- Yeah, heh. I'm serious, I'll do it.
- Good, go.

206
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,547
There's some girls right over there.

207
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,053
- What are you waiting for?
- They're in a group. I'm scared.

208
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,850
Sheldon,
what do you expect us to do?

209
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,188
You're biologists.
Biology is the study of living things.

210
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,523
That's a living thing. Get cracking.

211
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,070
I specialize in microorganisms
and Amy studies brains.

212
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,532
Yeah, neither of us minored
in bird shooing.

213
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,285
Oh, come, now.
Your undergraduate work...

214
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,705
...must've included
a varmints and critters class.

215
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,125
Come back in, Sheldon.
He's not gonna hurt you.

216
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,670
He looks friendly.
I think he might be someone's pet.

217
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,756
What? No, Bernadette.
Don't be a hero.

218
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:25,094
- Aw, he's a sweetie.
- Yes. He's very sweet.

219
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:30,058
Now slowly and carefully
flush him down the toilet.

220
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:37,023
Sheldon, the only way to get past
this fear is to interact with it.

221
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,901
Just like you did with the mailman.

222
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:44,781
Every year, tens of people
around the world are killed by birds.

223
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,451
I'm not going to be another statistic.

224
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,080
Look how sweet he is.
Come over and say hi.

225
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,920
Come on, you can do it.

226
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,171

00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,274
I actually did it.

232
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,110
Okay, now flush him.

233
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,323
So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?

234
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,409
Um, let's see.

235
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,494
Hiking.

236
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,622
Karaoke in Koreatown.

237
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,877
Any Jennifer Anniston movie.

238
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,422
- Hey, sorry I ditched you.
- No, it's fine. Ditch away.

239
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,424
Oh, no.
We were gonna hang out. Let's hang out.

240
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,802
- It's cool. Go back to Kevin.
- No, he had to leave.

241
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,178
Interesting.

242
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,806
So now that he's gone,
you wanna hang out with me.

243
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,391
- This must be Penny.
- Yep.

244
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,560
I totally get it.

245
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,357
- Uh, I'm sorry. Get what?
- Don't worry about it.

246
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,484
There's guys over there.
Go talk to them.

247
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,572
- No, no. I wanna know what you told her.
- That's kind of between me and...

248
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,532
- Laura.
- Laura.

249
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,410
Oh, okay, I see.
So while he was telling you things...

250
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,372
...did he mention he owns not one,
but two Star Trek uniforms?

251
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,374
- Really?
- Yeah. Wears them.

252
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,710
Not just for Halloween.

253
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,172
Hey, pal.

254
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,718
You didn't see me telling Kevin
that you thought cold wars...

255
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,387
...were only fought in winter.

256
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,598
Okay, then I'll return the favor...

257
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,059
- ...and I won't tell...
- Laura.

258
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:40,855
...Laura that half the dirty movies
you own are animated.

259
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,987
When you were telling Kevin
about your acting career...

260
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,823
...did you mention your long-running
role as waitress...

261
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,410
...in a local production
of The Cheesecake Factory?

262
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,789
Did you tell her
about your lucky asthma inhaler?

263
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,334
Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.

264
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,005
A-S...

265
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,966
Take me home.

266
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,759
Maybe I'm not done hanging out...

267
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,223
You're right, it's getting late.

268
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,689
It's remarkable.

269
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,901
All that time spent in fear. For what?

270
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,237
He's magnificent.

271
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:35,034
Ah! Oh, dear. I just realized
I haven't offered you a beverage.

272
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,752
Aw, it's just like my grandma
with her parrot.

273
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,339
And after she lost her marbles,
with her remote control.

274
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:54,887
My phone's on the desk over there.
Take a picture of us together.

275
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,766
Make it good enough to go on a mug,
a mouse pad and a calendar.

276
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,150
If you were a dove,
I'd call you Lovey Dovey.

277
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:11,404
Oh, who am I kidding? This isn't a moment
for strict adherence to the literal.

278
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,323
You're just my little Lovey Dovey,
aren't you?

279
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:19,579
I guess you gotta have hollow bones
to get some sugar around here.

280
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,500
I still think
he looks like someone's pet.

281
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,210
Maybe we should put up posters.

282
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,630
Yes, it should have a big picture of him
and the words:

283
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,426
"Is this your bird? Not anymore."

284
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,472
We're gonna have
so much fun together.

285
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,016
You can carry messages
to all my enemies.

286
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,267
And, um...

287
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,646
I can tie a string to your leg
and fly you like a kite.

288
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,399
If you're keeping him,
I've got a cage you can borrow.

289
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,528
One of the test monkeys slipped
on a banana peel and broke his neck.

290
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,199
It was both tragic and hysterical.

291
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,622
Nonsense. No, Lovey Dovey
doesn't sleep in a cage.

292
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,125
No, Lovey Dovey sleeps
in his very own nest...

293
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,837
...which I'm going to get off
the window sill and put in my room.

294
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,507
Isn't that right, L.D.?

295
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,804
No.

296
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,430
Where are you going?

297
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,017
Come back, Lovey Dovey.
This is your home now.

298
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:27,271
I already ordered 20 pounds
of bird feed off of Amazon.

299
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,443
- He's gone.
- I'm sorry, Sheldon.

300
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,570
How could he do this to me?

301
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:39,158

00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,988
I am such an asthmatic dumb-ass.

330
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,450
I had a weird night.

331
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,577
Mine was great.

332
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,580
I'm going to be a mommy.
