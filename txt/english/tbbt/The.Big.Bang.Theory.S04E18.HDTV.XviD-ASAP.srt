1
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:04,440
Morning.

2
00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:06,218
Morning.

3
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:09,213
- Sleep okay?
- Um uh.  Great!

4
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:13,211
Hey, can I ask you something?

5
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:14,436
Sure.

6
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:17,396
Last night, me wanting to try
that stuff out of the Kama Sutra.

7
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:20,366
Was that fun for you
or kinda racially insensitive?

8
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:24,158
Yes. Just because you're in bed
with an India woman

9
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:25,631
you think that gives you permission

10
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:28,750
to use crazy positions
from an ancient Indian love manual.

11
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:32,392
Hey, if you can find a book
called "Weird Sex with White Boys"

12
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:33,671
I'd be okay with that.

13
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:38,877
No, no, you know you have such
beautiful eyes.

14
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:41,103
Have you ever thought about
getting contacts?

15
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:44,009
I tried in the seventh grade.
I could never get used to them.

16
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:45,234
Oh. That's too bad.

17
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:47,963
Yeah. If I had contacts,
I would have been the coolest

18
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:50,996
Debate Club president ever to be
stuffed into his own cello case.

19
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:56,973
If you had them on now, you could
see what we're going to do next.

20
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:02,449
That-That's okay.
I can infer from context.

21
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:07,624
Hey, Raj, you wanna see a new
magic trick I been working on?

22
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:08,849
Eh, Howard.

23
00:01:08,874 --> 00:01:11,942
If I may interject here
with a piece of friendly advice.

24
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:15,781
Is working on magic tricks, really
how you want to spend your time?

25
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:19,589
Uh, granted,
you're just an engineer, but...

26
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:24,067
That doesn't mean you might
not someday build a geegaw

27
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:25,292
or a thingamabob that

28
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:29,869
that may get you a "thank you" in someone
else's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

29
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:36,729
Is the trick making him disappear?

30
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:40,384
Sure, let's see it.

31
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:43,285
Here.
Shuffle these.

32
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,510
Okay.

33
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,540
Now spread them out on the table.
Face down.

34
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,534
Pick one.
Look at it.

35
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:50,759
Okay.

36
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:52,752
Now remember your card.
Put it back in the deck.

37
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:54,682
Is it any wonder
he doesn't have a doctorate?

38
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:58,632
Now remind me,
what's your birthday?

39
00:01:58,657 --> 00:01:59,857
October sixth.

40
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,302
Okay, October is the tenth month.

41
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:07,863
So 10-- one plus zero
is one plus six is seven.

42
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:09,088
Turn over the seventh card.

43
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,942
How about that!

44
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,167
But, is that your card?

45
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:16,671
Yes. It is.
Very cool!

46
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,390
Oh it's not cool.

47
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:25,287
It's a childish trick, designed
to confuse and intrigue simpletons.

48
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:27,501
How'd you do it?

49
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:30,558
A magician never reveals his secrets.

50
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,403
But surely a future
Nobel Prize winner can figure it out.

51
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,850
Fine.

52
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,075
Give me a second.

53
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,116
You ever notice when he thinks
real hard it smells like bacon?

54
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:50,155
- Oh hey!
- Sorry! Oop!

55
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:01,015

66
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:34,844
One, two,

67
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,382
three, four, five.

68
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,233
No way.

69
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,217
That's your card, right?

70
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,718
Seven of clubs!

71
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,086
That is amazing!

72
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:45,423
It's not amazing.

73
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,060
All magic tricks are merely
a combination

74
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,762
of manipulation
and misdirection

75
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:55,399
with the occasional dwarf in
a box wiggling his feet.

76
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,369
Oh, really?
So how did I do it?

77
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,971
I don't care how you did it.

78
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:03,741
I have more important things
to think about.

79
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,615
Clearly, the cards
are marked.

80
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,984
I thought you had more important
things to think about.

81
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:14,752
I do.
You just happened

82
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:16,654
to have caught me
on a break.

83
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,392
Oh, let me see
those cards.

84
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:22,727
Big deal. Not knowing

85
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,262
is part of the fun.

86
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,130
"Not knowing is part
of the fun."

87
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:28,099
Was that the motto
of your community college?

88
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:32,570
Hey, guys,
what do you think?

89
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:34,038
Priya took me
clothes shopping.

90
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,256
Hey, you look great.

91
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:36,407
Good for you, Priya.

92
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,376
I could never get that stupid
hoodie off him

93
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:39,344
when we were...

94
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,478
Well, you look great.

95
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,913
Thank you.

96
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,548
Lets go hang
everything up.

97
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,966
Yeah, good.

98
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,252
New contacts.

99
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:50,588
I should have done this
years ago.

100
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,127
So you finally getting used to
them doing it on a daily basis?

101
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,262
I'm not going out with him.

102
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,730
He can sleep
with whoever he wants.

103
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,466
Yeah, I was talking to Raj.

104
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,006
Oopsy.

105
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,541
This deck is rigged in
some fashion.

106
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,508
Fine. Get another deck

107
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:11,843
and I'll do
the trick with that.

108
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,444
So you're saying this is
a regulation deck?

109
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:16,347
I'm saying believe in magic,
you muggle.

110
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:22,820
You know, well, I'm happy
Leonard's found someone.

111
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,392
Not that anybody asked.

112
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,599
How many Star Trek uniforms
do you have?

113
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,985
Just two:

114
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:39,470
everyday and dress.

115
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,138
Uh-huh.

116
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:44,308
Listen, we need
to talk about something.

117
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,444
Oh, my God, you're breaking up
with me!

118
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,713
Why would you take me out
shopping

119
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:51,149
and then break up with me?
That is so cruel!

120
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,052
Leonard, I'm not breaking up
with you.

121
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,004
Oh, okay.

122
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,843
So, what's up?

123
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:04,162
It's a little weird,

124
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,331
your ex-girlfriend hanging out
here all the time.

125
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:08,433
I know.

126
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,001
I usually never see
my ex-girlfriends,

127
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,437
unless their hard drives crash.

128
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:16,908
I'm just saying, how would you
feel if I was hanging out

129
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,276
with my ex-boyfriend?

130
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,711
Um, not great, I guess.

131
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,579
But Penny and I are
just friends.

132
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,947
I don't care.

133
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:24,816
This is a woman you have
slept with.

134
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,200
If you want her around,

135
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:29,520
then I have to wonder if maybe
you're not ready to move on.

136
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,239
No, no-no-no, I'm ready!

137
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,758
I gave up the gift of
sight for you.

138
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,393
If that's not moving on,
what is?

139
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,663
You need to cut the cord
with Penny.

140
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,032
Oh... okay.

141
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,367
You don't sound very confident.

142
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:44,969
No, no, I'm confident.

143
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,405
Its not like I'm unfamiliar with
the "get lost" conversation.

144
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,541
Although, this will be the first
time I'll be the one saying it.

145
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,710
Thank you.

146
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,045
I appreciate it.

147
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,313
Sure.

148
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,782
Oh, God, you
smell so good.

149
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,817
Of course, that
could just be

150
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:01,736
my other senses
getting stronger.

151
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,793
Hypothetically, if I had access

152
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:13,398
to a Lieutenant Uhura uniform,
would you wear it?

153
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,633
Leonard, it is a source
of great pain

154
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:16,768
to me and my family

155
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,936
that my brother has that outfit
in his wardrobe.

156
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:20,438
Can we not discuss it?

157
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,207
I'm sorry. Never mind.

158
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,147
And was your card the jack
of diamonds?

159
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:33,551
Oh, unbelievable!

160
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,222
Know how he did it yet?

161
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,762
Um...

162
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:47,965
Aw, he has the same look
my little nephew gets

163
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:50,768
when he can't figure out
how I got his nose.

164
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,374
You know, I have some remedial
magic tricks

165
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,142
that might be more your speed.

166
00:07:58,143 --> 00:07:59,577
Like, ooh, look!

167
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,914
The pencil's rubber!

168
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,385
Hey, I think I know how you did
the card trick.

169
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,755
Oh, please, if I don't know,
you don't know.

170
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,407
That's axiomatic.

171
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,292
Come here.

172
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,128
You're right.

173
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:20,565
Not too bad for someone

174
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,101
who doesn't know
what "axiomatic" means.

175
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:31,976
Oh, hi.

176
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:33,310
Hey, you.

177
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:34,812
What happened with
the contacts?

178
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:36,080
One of them's upstairs.

179
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,650
The other one sort of slipped
back into my skull.

180
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:42,003
Hey, is that one of the new
shirts Priya got you?

181
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,287
Yeah.

182
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:44,922
You don't wanna
wash that.

183
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,791
No?
No, that's silk.

184
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,010
Seriously, what would you do
without me?

185
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,895
Yeah.

186
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,682
You know, I gotta
tell you, I think

187
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:57,268
you got a real winner
with Priya.
Yeah, me, too.

188
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,636
She seems really sweet.

189
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,805
Believe me, you do not want
to take that for granted.

190
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,574
There are a lot of bitches
out there.

191
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:07,979
Yeah, bitches are the worst.

192
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,847
All right, I'll
see you later.

193
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:12,550
Uh, Penny, there's something
I have to tell you.

194
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,684
What?

195
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:16,454
Okay, uh, how do I put this?

196
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:21,125
Um... are you familiar with
Darwin's observation

197
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:24,195
of the finches
in the Galapagos Islands?

198
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,497
Did they make a movie about it?

199
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,199
No.

200
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,134
Then no.

201
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:33,938
All right, well, anyway, Darwin
observed that when two groups

202
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:36,340
of finches competed
over the same food source,

203
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:39,544
eventually one of them would
evolve a different beak shape

204
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,213
so they could feed on
something else.

205
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,816
Okay.

206
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,085
So what do you think we can
learn from that behavior

207
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,521
that we can apply
to our own lives?

208
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:55,560
Uh, a bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush?

209
00:09:57,362 --> 00:10:01,199
Sure, that has birds in it.

210
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,870
It's fun talking to you,
Leonard; I always learn stuff.

211
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:11,742
I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna count that.

212
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:19,217
Do you really have
to wear that in bed?

213
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,656
Yeah. The doctor didn't want me
to rub my eye during the night.

214
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:29,193
It was either this or one
of those giant neck cones.

215
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:33,598
So did you get
to talk to Penny?

216
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,301
Oh, yes.
Indeed, I did.

217
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,003
And?

218
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:41,806
She completely understood
everything I said. Case closed.

219
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,441
Was she upset?

220
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,744
Maybe, but that's
not my problem.

221
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:48,713
She's not my girlfriend,
you are.

222
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,716
I hope you weren't
cruel to her.

223
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:56,120
Is the autumn cruel
for letting the flowers die,

224
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:59,023
or is that just nature's way?

225
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,995
Leonard?
Leonard?

226
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,129
Leonard?

227
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,631
What?!

228
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,367
I think I figured out
Wolowitz's magic trick,

229
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,536
and I need you
to pick a card.

230
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:17,074
I am not opening
that door, Sheldon!

231
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:18,409
As you wish.

232
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:28,052
Pick a card, put it back,
and prepare to be amazed.

233
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:32,056
Did you pick one?

234
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:33,491
Yep.

235
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:38,496
Is this your card?

236
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,764
Nope.

237
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,966
Drat.

238
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:45,436
Is this your card?

239
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:47,605
No.

240
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,674
I'll be right back.

241
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:58,834
Pick a card, Sheldon.

242
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:04,273
Now look at it,
and put it back in the deck.

243
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,843
Now do you remember your card?

244
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:09,946
Of course I do, I have
an eidetic memory.

245
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:11,714
My apologies.

246
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:14,183
Now shuffle the cards.

247
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:16,686
Shuffling.

248
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:18,421
Wait here.

249
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:23,893
Processing image,
cross-referencing...

250
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:25,661
Whatcha doin'?

251
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,698
I'm reverse engineering
Wolowitz's magic trick.

252
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:32,802
What's up
with the infrared cameras?

253
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:35,304
I'm measuring residual heat
levels on the playing cards

254
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:36,906
to determine
which one's been touched.

255
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:38,775
By the way,

256
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:40,176
if you hope to have children,

257
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,045
I suggest you switch
from briefs to boxers.

258
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:43,946
Your testicles look a tad warm.

259
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:54,824
Holy crap,
are you connected

260
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:56,993
to the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory?

261
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:59,562
Yes. I'm using their
Cray supercomputer

262
00:12:59,563 --> 00:13:00,863
to analyze
shuffling patterns.

263
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,800
Sheldon, that computer
is used

264
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:05,068
for national defense.

265
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:06,736
Hacking into it is
a federal crime.

266
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:09,906
Relax, we're not under
attack right now.

267
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:15,545
Okay, I'm leaving before the
black helicopters get here.

268
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,283
And is this my card?

269
00:13:20,284 --> 00:13:22,718
Rats!

270
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:29,025
I wonder if Howard used
a radioactive tracer.

271
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:32,929
Where am I going to find
uranium-235 this time of night?

272
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:38,134
Come on, CraigsList.

273
00:13:42,272 --> 00:13:45,308
Is it racist that I took you
to an Indian restaurant?

274
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:48,778
It's okay, I like Indian food.

275
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:52,248
Or as you probably call it
back home, "food."

276
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,184
Why didn't you wear
your contacts?

277
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,486
Don't you like them?

278
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:57,753
No, no, I do.

279
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,822
It's just I knew I was having
curry tonight

280
00:13:59,823 --> 00:14:03,359
and I only want one part
of my body to burn at a time.

281
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:07,330
You know...

282
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:10,233
...my company offered me a
position here in Los Angeles.

283
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:14,337
Does that mean you'd relocate
here permanently?

284
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:16,873
Maybe. What do you think?

285
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:19,208
I love it.

286
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,177
That's great!

287
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:24,313
Hi!

288
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:27,817
Hi! Just hang on.

289
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:30,953
Small world.

290
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,121
You did talk to her, didn't you?

291
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,724
Of course, I did.
I talked and talked and talked.

292
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:39,828
Hey! Look at Leonard
in his fancy-ass
grownup clothes.

293
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:43,499
Way to go, Priya.
For once, he doesn't look

294
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,835
like a mannequin in
the boys' department.

295
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,604
Hey, did he

296
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:50,373
tell you I saved
the silk shirt?

297
00:14:50,374 --> 00:14:51,741
No, he did not.

298
00:14:51,742 --> 00:14:53,843
He was gonna throw it
in the washing machine

299
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:56,546
with his
Spiderman underwear.

300
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,314
That's our Lenny, huh?

301
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,284
Yes, that's our Lenny.

302
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:03,536
So how's
the food here?

303
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:06,405
Oh, wow, that is
really, really good.

304
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,407
Oh, I'm sorry.
You guys are on a date.

305
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,326
We can hang out
anytime. Have fun.

306
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,661
Bye.
Good night.

307
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,997
Oh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot!

308
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,086
Whoo! It really
sneaks up on ya, huh?

309
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,504
All right, I gotta go.

310
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:28,945
It is pretty spicy.

311
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:33,516
Oh, I've been meaning
to tell you,

312
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,785
I figured out
your magic trick.

313
00:15:35,786 --> 00:15:37,587
Really?

314
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:38,788
Oh, yes.

315
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:41,257
In fact, I improved upon it.

316
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,226
I'd love to see that.

317
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:44,493
How about you, Raj?

318
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:46,329
Beefaroni and a show?

319
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,030
How do you turn that down?

320
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:52,902
All right.

321
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:54,570
Pick a card.

322
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:56,839
Okay.

323
00:15:57,908 --> 00:15:59,408
Bippity-boppity-boo.

324
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:12,121
What's with the wand
and the beep?

325
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:13,889
The wand is called showmanship,

326
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,259
and the beep is none
of your business.

327
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:19,495
Oh! Excuse me.

328
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,030
I'm getting a text message

329
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:23,599
completely unrelated
to this magic trick.

330
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,203
Oh, look, my
dry cleaning's ready.

331
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:31,107
And your card was
the five of spades. Ta-da.

332
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:34,877
These cards have barcodes
on them.

333
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:35,944
The wand is a reader.

334
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:37,947
It's transmitting to your phone.

335
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:43,719
I said, "ta-da."

336
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,787
Show's over.

337
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:47,089
That's pathetic.

338
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,792
Let me show you how
a real magician does it.

339
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,126
Raj, take a card.

340
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:52,995
Don't let me see it.

341
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:55,331
Okay.

342
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,832
Three of clubs.

343
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,234
Son of a gun,

344
00:16:58,235 --> 00:16:59,769
you're blowing my mind!

345
00:17:02,873 --> 00:17:05,474
Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!

346
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,446
That does it.
I'm getting uranium.

347
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:16,652
You ever gonna tell him?

348
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:19,822
Maybe.
When it stops being fun.

349
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:22,308
So never.

350
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,967
Oh, hey, I was
just on my way to work.

351
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,436
Oh, okay,
its not important.

352
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:34,403
It can wait.

353
00:17:34,404 --> 00:17:36,022
No, it's all right.
Walk me down.

354
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,023
So, what's up?

355
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:38,708
Uh, I kind of have
a problem

356
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:40,710
I was hoping
you could help me with.

357
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:41,777
Sure, anything.

358
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:44,280
Move out.

359
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:45,648
What?

360
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:46,982
Not far.

361
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,051
Hey, if you ever wanna
start a family,

362
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:50,903
La Cañada has
some great schools.

363
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,321
Okay, I'm not
moving anywhere.

364
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,457
What the hell
is this all about?

365
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,026
Why does it have
to be about anything?

366
00:17:57,027 --> 00:17:59,128
Can't a fella ask
his buddy to relocate,

367
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:01,230
no questions asked?

368
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:02,631
Oh, for God's sake,
Leonard,

369
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:04,133
this is about Priya,
isn't it?

370
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:05,868
She doesn't want me
hanging out with you.

371
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:09,038
Yes. There, I said it.

372
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,841
Okay, look.

373
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,009
I happen to like
your girlfriend.

374
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,927
And she likes you.

375
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:15,578
No, she doesn't.

376
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:17,313
Not really, no.

377
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:19,248
It doesn't matter.
Look, I promise from now on

378
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:20,716
I will keep
my distance from you.

379
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:23,119
Well, now, hold on.
What kind of distance

380
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,054
are we talking about?
Because we are neighbors.

381
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:27,356
I mean, I can hear the toilet
flush in your apartment.

382
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,992
You can hear my toilet flush?

383
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:32,561
I don't listen for it,
but it's nice to know

384
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:36,132
everything's okay
with your plumbing.

385
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,000
The building's plumbing.

386
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,201
Leonard, I get it.

387
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,669
You're in
a new relationship now.

388
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,904
And I'm happy for you.

389
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:44,373
So why don't we
just shake hands
and part friends?

390
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,574
Well, now hold on.

391
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:46,809
How about this?

392
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,012
How about we still hang out,
but on the down-low?

393
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:53,549
Are you really that kind of guy?

394
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,217
No.

395
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:59,422
I actually felt kinda silly just
saying "on the down-low."

396
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:02,975
Good-bye, Leonard.

397
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:07,563
Penny, wait.

398
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,066
Ah!

399
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:16,839
Damn contacts.

400
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:24,529
Incoming.

401
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,116
- Hi!
- Hey!

402
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:29,367
Hello.

403
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:33,371
Why so glum, chum?

404
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,373
Apparently,
you can't hack into

405
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,342
a government
supercomputer

406
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,943
and then try
to buy uranium

407
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,079
without the Department of
Homeland Security tattling

408
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,247
to your mother.

409
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,120
Oh, that's too bad.

410
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,689
Figure out the magic trick yet?

411
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,991
Figure out the magic trick yet?

412
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,226
Want me to tell you
how to do it?

413
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,061
No.

414
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,796
Ill show you one more time.

415
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,397
Raj?

416
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,099
Hang on.

417
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,034
This time do it with me,

418
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,337
so I can make sure
there's no monkey business.

419
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:11,310
All right.

420
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:25,106
Two of hearts.
I hate you.

421
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:29,010

422
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,667
Yeah, he's gonna win
the Nobel Prize.
