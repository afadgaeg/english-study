1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,259
It's from Game of Thrones.

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,095
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,848
If we're going to start
a fantasy sword collection...

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,683
And I've long thought we should.

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,186
...Is this really the sword to start with?

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,980
What did you have in mind?

7
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:27,234
Well, off the top of my head,
I'd have to go with Excalibur.

8
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,987
It gives you the right to rule England.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,781
It would be a replica of a movie prop.

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,908
Fair enough.

11
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:38,454
It would give you the right
to rule a replica of England.

12
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,833
Well, they don't have an Excalibur here,
so, what do you want to do?

13
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,127
Ugh, tough decision.

14
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,671
There's no weaponry
from Lord of the Rings...

15
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,340
...forged in a Chinese sweatshop?

16
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,303
Mm-hm, just Bilbo Baggins'
sword over there.

17
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:58,682
Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger,
wouldn't we look silly?

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,686
- Okay, let's go for it.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Heh.

19
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,189
Oh, I see you guys have found
my little treasure.

20
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,983
Yeah, pfft, it's okay, I guess.

21
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,818
Okay? It's magnificent.

22
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,487
Buh-buh-buh-buh.

23
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,074
What do you want for it?

24
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,159
Oh, it's hard to
put a price on something...

25
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,828
...that's a copy of something
that was on pay cable.

26
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,332
But for my friends, let's say 250.

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,460
- Ooh, that's pretty steep.
- It's a limited edition.

28
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,922
They only made 8000 of these
bad boys.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,467
Only 8000.
We're wasting precious time. Buy it.

30
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,387
Hang on. Can you do any better?

31
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,432
I'm already giving
you the friends and family discount.

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,185
Oh, did you hear that?
The friends and family discount.

33
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,646
We are honored and we will take it.

34
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,065
Slow down. Two hundred.

35
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,818
What are you doing?
250 is already a discounted price.

36
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,904
- Will you shut up?
- Tell you what, I'll go 235.

37
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,322
Nope. Maybe another time.

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,451
- Okay, 225, my final offer.
- Take it, take it.

39
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,497
- Two hundred.
- Man, you're killing me.

40
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,707
Killing you? I can't breathe.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,044
Two ten and I'm losing money.

42
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,880
Oh, no, we can't let him lose money,
Leonard. I'm so sorry.

43
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,008
Two ten and you throw in
the Iron Man helmet.

44
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,803
Are you crazy? That helmet's
signed by Robert Downey, Jr.

45
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,054
So?

46
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,266
If you're gonna question
the importance of a signature...

47
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,310
...on a plastic helmet from a movie
based on a comic book...

48
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,772
...then all of our lives
have no meaning.

49
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,739
- Okay, fine. Just the sword, 210.
- Thank you. I can eat meat this week.

50
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,202
See that? I just saved us 40 bucks.

51
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,621
I've long said that what you lack
in academic knowledge...

52
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,166
...you make up for in street smarts.

53
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,209
- You want me to wrap it?
- No, it's okay.

54
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,212
I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.

55
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,299
- Hey, Stuart.
- Ah, hey, Wil.

56
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,843
Hello, Wil Wheaton.

57
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,515
- Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
- It's part of my sword collection.

58
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,976
- Do you have a sword collection?
- No.

59
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,395
Heh, I'm not surprised.

60
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,190
Here's the Batman six twelve...

61
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,859
...with the Jim Lee alternate cover
that you wanted.

62
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,528
- Oh, awesome. What do I owe you?
- Forty bucks.

63
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,488
- Good deal.
- Sucker.

64
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,450
He didn't even ask
for the friends and family discount.

65
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,703
I'm having a party on Friday
and I was hoping you would stop by.

66
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,997
- Will there be girls there?
- Of course.

67
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,209
Because there wasn't last time.

68
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,212
There will be girls.

69
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,881
You guys are invited
if you want to come by.

70
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,843
- Thank you.
- All right, great. Later.

71
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,764
I see what you're doing.

72
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,100
You accept an invitation to a party
at the home of my sworn enemy.

73
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,269
He tells everyone
we're going to be there.

74
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,397
And when we don't show,
he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.

75
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,693
I was actually thinking about going.

76
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,947
And then declaring the party
a fiasco and storming out...

77
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,825
...leaving him humiliated
in front of his guests. Love it.

78
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:09,081
No, I was gonna grab Raj
and Howard and have a good time.

79
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,166
Ah, great, more guys.

80
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,294
It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton
sausage-fest.

81
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,782
- Sheldon, can you grab me a water?
- Possibly.

82
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,452
- Can you or can't you?
- It's not that simple, Leonard.

83
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,038
It never is, is it?

84
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,166
At this moment,
our relationship exists...

85
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,585
...in two mutually contradictory states.

86
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,715
Until you either do not go
or go to Wil Wheaton's party...

87
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,135
...you are simultaneously
my friend and not my friend.

88
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:09,099
I'm characterizing this phenomenon
as Schrödinger's friendship.

89
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,062
- Got it. Can I have my water?
- Yeah, of course.

90
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,481
Now get it yourself, you traitor.

91
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,903
- Wait, what is going on?
- In case you have forgotten...

92
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,407
- ...Schrödinger's cat is a thought...
- No, I didn't forget.

93
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,452
Um, there's this cat in a box
and until you open it...

94
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,579
...it's either dead or alive or both.

95
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,707
Although our cat got stuck
in my brother's camp trunk...

96
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,919
...and we did not need to open it to know
there was all kinds of dead cat in there.

97
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,591
Homespun stories, knowledge
of physics and a bosom that defies it.

98
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,302
You're the whole package,
aren't you?

99
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,931
Sorry I'm late. Ugh, I got great news.

100
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,935
NASA picked my team's design
for the deep field space telescope...

101
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,563
...that's going on the
International Space Station this spring.

102
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,482
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: Oh, woo, heh.
<font color="#808080">AMY</font>: Wow, heh.

103
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,984
- Howie, that's wonderful! Congratulations!
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: Uh, heh.

104
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,237
It gets better. Someone has
to go up with the telescope...

105
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:09,117
...as a payload specialist,
and guess who that someone is, heh.

106
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,495
Muhammad Li.

107
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,873
Who's Muhammad Li?

108
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,626
Muhammad is the most
common first name in the world...

109
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,378
...Li, the most common surname.

110
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,048
As I didn't know the answer, I thought
that gave me a mathematical edge.

111
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,427
It's me, Sheldon. It's me.
I'm going up in space!

112
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,888
Technically, I'm an astronaut.

113
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,807
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Oh, my God.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: That's amazing.

114
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,850
- Heh.
- Hang on a second.

115
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,519
NASA doesn't have a shuttle anymore.

116
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,771
- How are you gonna get up there?
- Oh, uh, it's cool.

117
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,190
You fly to Moscow,
they take you to Kazakhstan.

118
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,194
Then you get in a Russian Soyuz rocket
which shoots you into a low earth orbit.

119
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,656
Or it just sits on the launch pad because
the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel...

120
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,367
...on the black market, heh.

121
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,537
Are those Russian rockets safe?

122
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,788
Safe as it can be...

123
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,916
...when it was built by the folks
who brought you Chernobyl. Ha, ha.

124
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,421
I'd like to propose a toast.

125
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,090
The dream to go up into space
is one we all share...

126
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,844
...and Howard's making that a reality.
We're all very proud of you.

00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,095

- That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
- Thank you.

130
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,061
Simultaneously, a festival
of cloying clichés. You sicken me.

131
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,072
You're really quiet. Is everything okay?

132
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,075
Fine.

133
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,954
Just a little tired.

134
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:40,250
I hope not too tired because I'm feeling
particularly masculine right now.

135
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,588
All systems go,
if you catch my drift. Heh.

136
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,216
I always catch your drift.

137
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,094
Well, something's obviously
bugging you.

138
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,304
What is it?

139
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,516
I can't believe you signed up for
the space program without talking to me.

You're worried about me.

142
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:09,070
That is so sweet. You know,
there's a saying we have at NASA.

143
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:17,370
What makes the right stuff so right
is that it always comes home.

144
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,166
Just stop talking, Howard.

145
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,419
This isn't the reaction I expected...

146
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,255
...when I told you
I was gonna be an astronaut.

147
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,549
What did you think was gonna happen?

148
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,177
Honestly? Sex, heh.

149
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,806
- Howard.
- Do you realize what a big deal this is?

150
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,936
What an honor it is
to be chosen to go into space?

151
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,731
Yeah, I get it. I just wish
you included me in the decision.

152
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,443
We're supposed to be partners.
We're supposed to be a team.

00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,733
- So, what do you think?
- No.

165
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,279
- No?
- No.

166
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,780
Wh...?

167
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,824
Whoa, why not?

168
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,912
Howard, ugh,
my father was a police officer.

169
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,123
We never knew
from one night to the next...

170
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,501
...if he was gonna come home alive.
It was horrible.

171
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,337
And I don't want to live
that way with you.

173
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,174
Well, hey...

174
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:57,846
...my father abandoned me
and my mother when I was 11.

175
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,765
We never saw him again.

176
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,892
Oh, boo hoo, you're not going to space.

177
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,484
- Pretty cool about Howard, huh?
- Don't talk to me...

178
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,030
...as if nothing's happened between us.
And yes, it sure is, buddy.

179
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,076
Will you stop
with the Schrödinger stuff?

180
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,705
Would you prefer an application
of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?

181
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,041
In which I could either
know where you are...

182
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,627
...or whether I like you, but not both?

183
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,672
You never stop talking, do you?

184
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,636
What difference does it make
if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?

185
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,055
No, Wil Wheaton
is Sheldon's mortal enemy.

186
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,057
- Mortal enemy?
- Mm-hm.

187
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,435
Sheldon, I know you're a bit
of a left-handed monkey wrench but...

188
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,482
- You really have a mortal enemy?
- In fact, I have 61 of them.

189
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,403
- Would you like to see the list?
- Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.

190
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,907
You just got off the list.
Would you like back on it?

191
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:06,373
This'll just take a moment.
It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.

192
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:16,424
- A floppy disk?
- Well, I started the list when I was 9.

193
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,718
How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?

194
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,261
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Oh, God.
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Come on.

195
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,556
As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher...

196
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,600
...Wil Wheaton's character
on Star Trek.

197
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,687
So I drove for hours by bus
to a Star Trek convention...

198
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,231
...at which Wil Wheaton
was scheduled to appear...

199
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,401
...so that I could get
my Wesley Crusher action figure signed.

200
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,652
But he never showed...

201
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,279
...because apparently,
it was "cooler" for him...

202
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,324
...to be the lower-left corner
on Hollywood Squares.

203
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,913
Oh, damn! The floppy failed.

204
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,499
Well, whoever was in charge
of quality control...

205
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:54,963
...at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989,
congratulations, you just made the list.

206
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,762
- Howard?
- Change your mind about sex?

207
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,598
I'm still mad but I'll do it.

208
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,144
No, I've just been thinking.

- Really.

213

If going into space means that much
I will never say another word about it.

214
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,702
Thank you, heh.

215
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,371

- I love you too, heh.

216
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,752

00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,671
- Okay.
- Heh.

You actually asked Bernadette
to leave your house?

What choice did I have?
She went behind my back...

225

...and turned
my own mother against me.

- Little bit, heh.
- I hate to say it...

230
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,568
- ...but she did kind of betray you.
- Interesting.

231
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:45,031
You see betrayal in others
but not yourself.

232
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,410
Going to Wheaton's party
is not betraying you.

Of course, you would have to believe that.
Evil always thinks it's doing right.

00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,314
If we're going to get back together,
she's gonna have to apologize...

241
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,902
...and accept that I'm a grown man
who can make his own decisions.

242
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,655
Then convince your mother
to let you go into space.

243
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,073
Obviously.

244

And you're going to have to choke back

272
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,181
...as you mumble,
"I was, but I chose to go to a party...

...to get one signed and I didn't show.
Look at what I wrote.

324
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:38,634
"To Sheldon, sorry this took so long.
Your friend, Wil Wheaton."

325
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,679
It's my last one.
I want you to have it.

326
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,934
Look, everyone.
Wil Wheaton is my friend!

327
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,859
Oh, wow. I haven't seen
one of these in years.

328
00:19:56,236 --> 00:20:00,281
Remember how we used to make these
things look like they were masturbating?

329
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,825
Brent Spiner, what have you done?

330
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,786
That was a mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.

331
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,414
Signed by my close personal friend,
Wil Wheaton.

332
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:12,001
Sorry, Slim. I've got some Mr. Data dolls
in the trunk of my car.

333
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,711
You want me to sign one for you?

334
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,088
You've already signed something,
Brent Spiner.

335
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,674
Your name on my list.

336
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,930
From this moment on,
you are my mortal enemy.

337
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,807
Don't worry. It doesn't take up
a whole lot of your time.

338
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,103
Come on, buddy. Let's not waste
another second on this loser.

339
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,898
Love your house.

340
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,902
- Can we get autographed dolls?
- Sure.

341
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,738
Twenty bucks.

342
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,034
Ten.

343
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,497
- Eighteen.
- Twelve.

344
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,749
- Sixteen.
- Two for 30.

345
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,377
And you come to my birthday party.

346
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,173
Done.
