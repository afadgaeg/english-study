Dave Roeger, here, at NASA. We need
to talk about your upcoming mission.

Yes, yes, I've been doing

I'm still stuck at nine, but...

6
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,816

That's great, uh, but that's not why I called.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,529
We've run into a bit of a snafu.

9
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,198
Your Soyuz capsule failed
the pressurization test...

10
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,910
...so bottom line,
the mission's been scrubbed.

11
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,415
You're kidding.
So, what does that mean?

12
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,043
Uh-huh.

I'm really disappointed.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,178
This was my dream

This one's a little tight under the arms.

25
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,278
Okay.

26
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,115
Maybe it's tight because
you're wearing long underwear?

27
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,158
Yes, of course that's why it's tight.

28
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,745
Let me rephrase the question.

29
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,456
- Why are you wearing long underwear?
- You're kidding.

30
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,751
Shouldn't the question be,
why aren't you?

31
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,338
No, it should be, why are you?

32
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,799
Leonard, these rental tuxedos...

33
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,052
...have been worn by hundreds
of sweaty strangers.

34
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,263
I don't like my own sweat
touching my skin.

35
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,640
How do you think I feel about theirs?

36
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,477
- Why don't you slip this on?
- Said the hangman offering a noose.

37
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,274
Heh, well, that wasn't as entertaining
as when he rents bowling shoes...

38
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,109
...but it was right up there.

39
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,988
Well, that's it.
My orders have been rescinded.

40
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,532
I am officially "no go" to space.

41
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,703
I'm sorry, Howard, but I gotta tell you,
I'm a little relieved you're not going.

42
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,413
- Why?
- Come on.

43
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,958
You were gonna go in a rocket
designed in the 1960s by the Russians.

44
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,376
Yeah, so?

45
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,837
When was the last time
you heard someone say:

46
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,757
"Ooh, check out this Blu-ray player.
It must be good, it was built in Russia"?

47
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,220
Well, their technology isn't that bad.

48
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,016
When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz
capsule, you free-fall from space...

49
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,477
...at 500 miles per hour, and the only
thing that slows you down...

50
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,939
...is a parachute that pops out
before you crash into the ground.

51
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,609
The thing was designed
by the same brilliant minds...

52
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,820
...who were unable to capture
Rocky and Bullwinkle.

53
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,241
All right, well, whatever.
I wasn't worried.

54
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,492
You weren't?

55
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,038
Okay, let me explain
the difference between you and me.

56
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:30,417

57
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,338
Oh, I don't remember
the episode of Star Trek...

58
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,550

and brags about it in a tuxedo store.

59

Make all the jokes you want, but there's
only one of us brave enough...

00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,431

not your worst opening line.

Check it out. It's the gas I use
in my laser to support high voltages.

75

secondary use.

00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,518
I'm sorry, I did. I crossed a line.
I didn't mean to!

162
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,895
Who says that
right in the middle of sex?

163
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,564
I don't know. It just came out.

164
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,108
People say weird things
during sex all the time.

165
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,736
- Well, they sure as hell don't say that.
- Lt was the heat of the moment.

166
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,656
No, the heat of the moment is,
"Yeah, just like that"...

167
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,409
...not, "Will you marry me?"

168
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,914
- I'm sorry, just give me another chance.
- So you can crawl under covers and go:

169
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:47,168
"Hey baby, wanna go look for houses
in neighborhoods with good schools"?

170
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:52,048
Again, I'm sorry. With Howard
and Bernadette getting married...

171
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,509
...I got caught up
in a little wedding fever.

172
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,094
I take it back.

173
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,806
You can't take something like that back.
What are we supposed to do now?

174
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:05,687
Okay, at some point, we'll look back
and this is going to be a funny story.

175
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,148
Why don't we just start
doing that now?

176
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,983
- You're kidding.
- No.

177
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,945
Hey, do you remember...

178
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:19,284
...that time when I proposed to you
in bed, heh?

179
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,495
And you were all, like,
"What are you doing"?

181
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,333
That was so funny.

182
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,003
So funny.

183
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,633
- It's not funny.
- Just give it a minute.

184
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,303
Is that a little smile I see there?

185
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,389
I should go.

186
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,020
Hey, I was thinking, for our first dance
at the wedding...

187
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,732
...what if we learn the final number
from Dirty Dancing?

188
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,194
- You're kidding.
- No, come on.

189
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:58,490
How cool would that be?
Me running into your arms.

190
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,035
You lifting me up into the air.

00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,374
- You're in a good mood.
- Yeah, well, why wouldn't I be?

193
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,834
I'm marrying the girl of my dreams...

194
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,879
...and finally got my mother to agree
not to come on our honeymoon.

Oh, hi, Dave. What's up, heh?

201
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,561
No kidding. Really, heh?

202
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,066
Well, that's great news.

203
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,652
Great, great news.

204
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,699
All right, I'll watch my e-mail
for the details.

205
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,785
Okay, talk soon.

206
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,454
What's so great?

207
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,333
It looks like I'm going into space
after all, heh.

208
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,711
Howie, that's wonderful.

209
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,005
Uh-huh, wonderful.

210
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,717
Yay!

211
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,973
What happened?
I thought they cancelled your mission.

212
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:09,060
They... They did.
But NASA really wants my telescope...

213
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,481
...up on the space station, so they're
putting me on an earlier launch.

214
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,442
When?

215
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,736
A week from Friday.

216
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,530
What? We're getting married
that Sunday.

217
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:26,745
You're right, heh. I... I can't go to space.
I have to get married...

218
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,373
...and no one can say that's not
a good reason. I'll call him back.

219
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,836
Wait. I don't wanna be the one
who stands in your way.

220
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,506
Well, too bad, you already did.
It's a done deal. But I forgive you.

221
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,009
No. That's not how I wanna start
our marriage.

222
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:44,262
Killing your dream? We'll have
the wedding when you get back.

223
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,767
Yeah, but what about all the plans
and the guests?

224
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,018
We'll call them.

225
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,980
Although my dad's gonna go
a little nutso over losing his deposits.

226
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,901
You're right, he is.

227
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,028
Your dad's gonna be furious.

228
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,781
There's no way he's gonna let us
postpone this wedding.

229
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,991
Well, we tried.

230
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,120
I'll talk to him.
He won't say no to his little girl, heh.

231
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,541
No, I... l should talk to him.
You know, man to man.

232
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,126
Howie, my dad can be a bully.

233
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,420
He's gonna make you cancel
your flight.

234
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,632
Yeah, we can only hope, heh,
that he doesn't.

235
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,931
Bishop to queen four, level two.

236
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,977
- Check.
- Sheldon, Knight takes Bishop.

237
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,021
You all right?

238
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,440
I'm fine.

239
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,611
Are you? You left your queen exposed
from above...

240
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,114
...trapped your knight in the corner,
and you keep sighing and saying:

241
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,783
"Why me?"

243
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,994
Very well.

244
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,998
Can I ask you a question
about women?

245
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,294
We got you that book last year.
Wasn't everything in there?

246
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,173
No. I'm having
a relationship problem with Amy.

247
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,552
And by the way,
that book gave me nightmares.

248
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,513
If it makes you feel any better...

249
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,057
...I screwed things up pretty good
with Penny.

250
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,643
Look at us, Leonard.

251
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:18,523
Engaging in the social convention of
men bellyaching about their old ladies.

252
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,860
I guess we are. So...

253
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,486
What's going on?

254
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,282
Believe it or not,
Amy has embarked on a campaign...

255
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:32,412
...to increase my feelings for her
by making me happy.

256
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,500
I'm sorry,
that must be very difficult for you.

257
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,378
It's awful. This morning...

258
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,048
...she arranged for me to be
an Amtrak Junior Conductor for the day.

259
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:49,053
It's usually only open to children.
She got them to make an exception.

260
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,931
Shame on her.

261
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,851
They let me blow the whistle,
Leonard.

262
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,896
She's good.

263
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,481
I know. And it gets worse.

264
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,569
Her efforts are causing me
to have affectionate feelings for her...

265
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,780
...at inappropriate times.

266
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,744
You mean like in bed
or in the shower?

267
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:17,206
No. And would you please stop
referencing that infernal book?

268
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,376
For example, this morning...

269
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,589
...I was calculating the random motion
of virtual particles in a vacuum...

270
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:31,554
...when suddenly, the particles morphed
into an image of Amy's dandruff...

271
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:39,646
...gently cascading down onto her pale,
slightly hunched shoulders.

273
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,275
What has that vixen done to me,
Leonard?

274
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,110
How do I make it stop?

275
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,114
Well, if you had a physical relationship,
I'd say propose during sex.

276
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,992
Turns out that's a real mood-killer.

277
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,287
- I assume we're talking about you now?
- Yeah.

278
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,791
So that's how this works?
I complain and then you complain...

279
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,502
...and no one offers any solutions?

280
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,421
Pretty much.

281
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,383
Well, no wonder the women
are winning.

282
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,555
Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?

283
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,225
Just looking at some old pictures.
Come on in.

284
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:21,688
Family pictures, or...?
Holy crap, that's a dead person.

285
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,108
Last murder case before I retired.

286
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,276
How many bodies do you see there?

287
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,738
Careful. It's a trick question.

288
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:37,120
- I'm not sure.
- No, you'll never get it. It's a fraction.

289
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,580
How about that, heh.

290
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,002
Anyway, sir,
I need to talk to you about something.

291
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,670
Walnut?

292
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,715
No, thank you. I'm allergic.

293
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:54,220
Oh, sure. My partner used to have that.
He's dead now.

294
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,975
- From nuts, heh?
- No, his wife shot him.

295
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,730
But she was nuts. So in a way...

296
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,859
Nice story. Anyway...

297
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,278
...the reason
I wanted to talk to you is...

298
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:15,241
...NASA has moved up my launch
to the international Space Station.

299
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:19,287
- Yeah, so?
- So the date is going to conflict...

300
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,957
...with me marrying your daughter.
Now, I know what you're going to say.

301
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,752
I made a commitment to Bernadette
and to your family...

302
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,756
...and I've got a lot of nerve coming here
and demanding that we postpone this.

303
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,176
Well, message heard and understood.
Mission cancelled. Thank you.

304
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,387
Where are you going?

305
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,805
I'm sorry.

306
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,224
May I be excused?

307
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,186
No, you may not.
Let me tell you something.

308
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,481
When I first met you...
You just gonna stand there?

309
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,276
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Is this going to...?

310
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,029
Well, I should sit...
May I be seated? I'll just sit.

311
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,118
When I first met you, I didn't like you.

312
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,622
I'm aware of that, sir.

313
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,583
But then you and I
had some time together.

314
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,251
Uh-huh, heh.

315
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,545
It did not get better.

316
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,881
Right, right, heh.

317
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,966
That silly Beatle haircut.

318
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,261
You riding around on a red Vespa.

319
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,139
And you're still living at home
with your mother.

320
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,769
To be honest, I thought Bernadette
chose you to punish me.

321
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,107
But then I heard
about your astronaut thing...

322
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:33,111
...and I realized I judged you too fast.

323
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,447
Maybe you are the right guy
for my little girl.

324
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,118
Oh, I am. And just so you know
I'd still be an astronaut...

325
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,828
...even if I didn't go to space, heh.

326
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,957
You know, I've got an ID card
and a NASA golf shirt.

327
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,208
No, no. You gotta go.

328
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,627
You can't turn down
an opportunity like this.

330
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,255
But what about the wedding...

331
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,757
...and all the money you put down
for the reception?

332
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,467
You let me worry about that.

333
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,513
You go up to that space station
and you make me proud.

334
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,227
Um, okay.

336
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,313
You got a problem with that?

337
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,899
All right, look,
I'm gonna level with you.

338
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,319
I'm terrified about going into space.

339
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,698
I mean, uh,
what if I don't make it back?

340
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,701
It's gonna be okay, son.

341
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,789
- You really think so?
- Of course.

342
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,669
A pretty girl like Bernadette.
She'll find a new guy.

343
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,513
- Hey.
- Hey.

344
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,557
- Off to work?
- Yeah.

345
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,435
- Have a nice night.
- Okay, you too.

346
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,646
Penny, just wait.

347
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,858
I've been thinking about what I said
when we were in bed.

348
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,027
Yeah, I've been thinking about it too.

349
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,279
I noticed you never answered me.

350
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,741
You're right.

351
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,080
No.

352
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,878
- Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Yep.

353
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,548
- Is it still weird because I proposed?
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Yep.

354
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,425
I have a couple more
quick questions.

355
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,595
- Do you wanna call me from the car?
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Nope.

356
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,058
I played that pretty well.

Hello, Leonard.

- What are you doing?
- We're playing doctor.
