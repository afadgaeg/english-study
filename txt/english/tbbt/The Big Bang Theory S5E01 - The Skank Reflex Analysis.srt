My brother...

00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:07,506
...he's got a big crush on Bernadette.

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,883
You're moving back to India?

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,600
What's going on?

00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,360
What does it look like?

10
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:39,121
It's not what it looks like.

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,831
What are you grinding about?

12
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,959
Penny's brain teaser this morning.

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,755
She and Koothrappali
emerge from your bedroom.

14
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,633
She is disheveled
and Raj is dressed only in a sheet.

15
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:56,555
The sole clue:
It's not what it looks like.

16
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,349
Tsk, just let it go, Sheldon.

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,936
If I could, I would,
but I can't, so I shan't.

18
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,354
Now...

19
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:08,442
...knowing Penny, the obvious answer is
they engaged in coitus.

20
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:14,573
But since that's what it looks like,
we can rule that out.

21
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,952
Let's put on our thinking caps,
shall we?

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,961
Raj is from India, a tropical country,
third-world hygiene...

23
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,590
...parasitic infections are common,
such as pinworms.

24
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,384
- Mm-hm.
- The procedure for diagnosing pinworms...

25
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,553
...is to wait until the subject is asleep...

26
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,264
...and the worms crawl out of the rectum
for air.

27
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,564
Yes, just like that.

28
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:53,195
Penny could have been inspecting
Raj's anal region for parasites.

29
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,865
Oh, boy, that's a true-blue friend.

30
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,035
They slept together, Sherlock.

No, you weren't listening.

33
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,250
She said, "it's not what it looks like."

34
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,544
She lied.

35
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,590
Oh.

36
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,178
Now don't I look silly
sitting here wearing this?

37
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,463
- Hey.
- Hey.

38
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,677
Hey.

39
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,937
Leonard, is it awkward for you...

40
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,024
...knowing one of your dear friends
had sexual intercourse...

41
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,777
...with a woman you used to love
in the very place you lay your head?

42
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,157
No, I'm fine with it.

43
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,202
That sounds like sarcasm.

44
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,371
But I'm gonna disregard it
because I have an agenda. Paintball.

45
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,958
Specifically, the interdepartmental
tournament this weekend.

46
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,170
Now, in order to function better
as a fighting unit...

47
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,839
...I thought we should establish
a chain of command.

48
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,259
Now, it goes without saying
that I would outrank the three of you.

49
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,221
But the question remains,
by how much?

50
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:47,100
Now, I don't see me
as some four-star general back at HQ...

51
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,354
...riding a desk and playing golf
with the Secretary of Defense.

52
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:54,316
But I also can't be Sergeant Cooper
because that might lead you...

53
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,487
...to think of me as a regular Joe. This
might take some thought. As you were.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,990
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- How could you do that?

55
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,825
- What is it to you?
- I got his back.

56
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,786
Yeah, right.
You're jealous because...

57
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,289
...I'm Penny's number-two choice
after Leonard.

58
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,168
Hey, if I wasn't engaged to Bernadette,
that totally could have been me.

59
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,505
Please. Sheldon would've
been before you...

60
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,383
...and he might not even
have genitals.

61
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,052
Why do you care so much?
You're dating my sister...

62
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,887
...and Penny and I are in love.

63
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,222
- What, heh?
- What?

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,433
Gentlemen, if I may interject.

65
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,978
I've decided my rank will be captain.

66
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,647
If it's good enough for Kirk,
Crunch and Kangaroo...

67
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,691
...it's good enough for me.

68
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,944
- You're not in love with Penny.
- Yes, I am.

69
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,282
The god Kamadeva has shot us
with his flowery arrows of love.

70
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,034
- Who?
- He's the Hindu version of Cupid...

71
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,246
...but way better
because he rides a giant parrot.

72
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,292
Raj, come on, you fall in love
with any girl who smiles at you.

73
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,420
A month ago, you were writing poems
about his fiancée.

Keeping accurate track
of your alcohol intake.

87
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,436
Smart idea, considering how trampy
you get when you've had a few.

88
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,313
You heard what I did?

- Well, I heard who you did.
- Ugh.

I mean, what is wrong with me?

92

- Know the story of Catherine the Great?
- No.

She ruled Russia in the late 1700s, and
one night when she was feeling randy...

97
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:29,304
...she used an intricate system of pulleys
to have intimate relations with a horse.

98

I'm sorry,
what does this have to do with me?

99
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,436
She engaged
in inter-species hanky-panky...

100
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,271
...and people still call her great.

to marry Jason Sorensen...

...but by the time my class got out there,
he was engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb.

Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary
to caption the obvious?

149
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,447
He's been like that
since he was a toddler.

What's going on?
What do you want?

But I can't deal with the fact
that she slept with my friend, Raj.

is moving back to India.

334
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:24,972
Oh, sweetie.

335
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,308
Hemorrhoids acting up again?

336
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,393
You don't know the half of it.

337
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,604
Oh, yes, I do.

338
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,898
Try a dab of this.

339
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,654
"Rose-scented Preparation-H
for women?"

340
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,616
Now, the H is for her.

341
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,374
- I'm proud of you.
- Shh. Here comes my joke.

342
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,334
How you doing?

343
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,504
Sitting pretty.
