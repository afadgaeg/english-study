1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,204
- Hold.
- What?

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:08,806
Explain your sneeze.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,810
- I'm sorry?
- Do you have allergies?

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,809
- No.
- Too much pepper on your salad?

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,415
- I don't put pepper on salads.
- I've heard enough. Sit over there.

6
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,811
Come on, I don't wanna sit by myself.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,887
That's what Typhoid Mary said.
Clearly, her friends buckled.

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,515
Guys, help me.

9
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,522
- Sheldon, come on.
- Yeah, it's just one sneeze.

10
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,022
- You're on your own.
- See you, buddy.

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,196
Oh, Leonard, I have something for you.

12
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,495
Per our roommate agreement,
this is your 24-hour notice...

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,934
...that I will be having
a non-related female...

14
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,666
...spending two nights
in our apartment.

15
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:47,771
When you say non-related female,
you still mean human, right?

16
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,039
Well, of course.

17
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,743
Pets are banned by the agreement,
with the exception of service animals...

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,911
...such as Seeing Eye dogs
and, one day...

19
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,386
...cybernetically enhanced
helper monkeys.

20
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,551
Are you planning
on kidnapping a woman?

21
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,586
- Sarcasm?
- Yes.

22
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:06,528
But mixed with genuine concern.

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,098
For your information...

24
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:11,135
...I'll be playing host
to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.

25
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,966
- Cosmological physicist from Princeton?
- Yes.

26
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,073
And until you acquire
a surgical mask...

27
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,304
...please address your comments to me
through a napkin.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,881
We've been corresponding for years
about our mutual interest...

29
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,485
...in gravitational wave signatures
of inflatons in the early universe.

30
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,987
Now she's under consideration
for a position at our university.

31
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,658
Why didn't you tell me
you knew Elizabeth Plimpton?

32
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,886
I am a huge fan of hers.

33
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,327
I didn't realize I had to share
my connection...

34
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,762
...with things you're a fan of,
but, very well.

35
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,732
You enjoy Canadian bacon.
I've been to Toronto.

36
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,802
- Okay, fine. Where is she gonna sleep?
- My room, of course.

37
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,340
Holy crap.

38
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,304
Holy crap.

39
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,983
- Yeah, I have a two-part question.
- Go ahead.

40
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,345
A, are you kidding me?

41
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,852
And B, seriously,
are you freaking kidding me?

42
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,289
A, I rarely kid.

43
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,862
And B, when I do kid, you will know it
by my use of the word "buzzinga."

44
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:14,365
So you're saying the two of you are
going to be sleeping in the same bed?

45
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,966
Yes.

46
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,301
Buzzinga.

47
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,166
Leonard?

48
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,867
Thank you.

49
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:29,278
Why is a renowned scientist staying
in our apartment instead of a hotel?

50
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,951
She doesn't care for hotels.
And who can blame her?

51
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,781
Windows that don't open,
multi-user linens...

52
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,615
...keys shaped like credit cards.

53
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,691
As if one walks around
with unassigned slots in one's wallet.

54
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,989
All right, I believe I have time
for one more question.

55
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,695
Yes, Raj?

56
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,857
When can I sit with you again?

57
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,562
When I've seen two negative
throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart.

58
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,035
You know the drill.

59
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,833
All right, if you'll excuse me...

60
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,637
...I am off to start
a prophylactic course of antibiotics.

61
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,641
I can't believe he's friends
with Elizabeth Plimpton.

62
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,375
I can't believe
they let him into Canada.

63
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,316
Whoa. You heard the man.
Where's your throat cultures?

64
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,318
- Kidding. Sit down.
- Ha.

65
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,526
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Oh, Penny, excellent.

66
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,097
I have a question
about these maxi pads.

67
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:58,398
Are the wings truly functional
or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?

68
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,139
What? What are you
doing with...? What?

69
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,038
The stock boy at Walgreens was
frustratingly uninformed on the subject.

70
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,646
Sheldon, what are you doing
with maxi pads?

71
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,979
I have a lady friend who will
be staying with me for a few days.

72
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,279
Oh.

73
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,580
What?

74
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,314
I want her to feel at home.

75
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:21,791
I also bought scented soaps,
pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews...

76
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,897
...and what is apparently a yogurt
specifically designed...

77
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,590
...to regulate the female bowel.

78
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,668
Wait. Wait, hold on. Back up.

79
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,771
You're having a woman stay with you?

80
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,636
Yes. Why does that seem
to flabbergast everybody?

81
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,471
No, no, no, I'm not flabbergasted.

82
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,237
I'm puzzled.

83
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,643
Yeah, let's go with puzzled.

84
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,078
A word of warning:

85
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,116
My guest is a noted physicist...

86
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,618
...and the leading expert
on quantum cosmology...

87
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,987
...so please try to avoid wasting her time
with female gibber-gabber.

88
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:54,987
Female gibber-gabber?

89
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,858
Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks...

90
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,865
...gossip about your friends,
Brad and Angelina.

91
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,468
No, they're not my friends.

92
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,768
Not surprised, considering how
you talk about them behind their backs.

93
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,277
She's here. She's here.
How do I look? Do I look smart?

94
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,710
Oh, good grief. This isn't about you.

95
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:20,977
Coming.

96
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,123
Now, listen, one of the great minds
of the 21st century...

97
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:28,557
...is about to play host to one of the
other great minds of the 21st century.

98
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,721
So pay attention.

99
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:34,799
Years from now, my biographer
might ask you about this event.

100
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,797
Well, I have so many things
to tell your biographer.

101
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,336
Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness.

102
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,135
I completely forgot your address.

103
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,870
But then, I remembered
that I'd written it on my hand.

104
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,843
Lucky I didn't confuse it with
what I'd written on my other hand...

105
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,314
...which are the coordinates
for a neutron star.

106
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,478
Because if I tried to go there,
I'd be crushed by hyper gravity.

107
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,658
- Anyway, hello.
- Hello.

108
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,987
- Nice to finally meet you in person.
- I would imagine it is.

109
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,729
This is my friend and roommate,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

110
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,425
Hi-lo.

111
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,071
Oops. I started to say hi, and then
I switched to hello in the middle.

112
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,106
It came out "hi-lo."

113
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,708
Duh.

114
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,245
It's nice to meet you.

115
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,678
I've read both your books
and your papers.

116
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,445
I'm Leonard.
I live here. You're brilliant.

117
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,020
I apologize.
He's only an experimental physicist.

118
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,252
No need to apologize. Some of my
best friends are experimental physicists.

119
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,090
Well, not my best friends.
But I know them.

120
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,898
My best friend
is a molecular chemist named Wendy.

121
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,093
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

122
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,898
- Hi-lo.
- Heh, heh.

123
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,706
Hungry? Can I offer you anything?

124
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,707
If anyone should offer her anything,
it should be me.

125
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,573
Elizabeth, can I get you something?

126
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,808
Perhaps a feminine-hygiene product
or a bowel-regulating yogurt?

127
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,475
Interesting choices.

128
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,554
Based on my current needs,
I guess I'd pick the yogurt.

129
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,780
Excellent.

130
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:07,449
If the yogurt works, I bought
some delightful scented candles.

131
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,259
Look, it's you.

132
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,905
Thank you so much
for opening up your home to me.

133
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,768
Well, who wants to stay in a hotel?

134
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,935
Windows that don't open,
those crazy card-shaped keys.

135
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm so glad you understand.

136
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,511
No, he doesn't understand.

137
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,777
- I understand.
- I understand too.

138
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,454
You're just misappropriating
my understanding.

139
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,116
I think any university would want you.

140
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,693
Except any university
that already had you...

141
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,023
...because they would've
already wanted you...

142
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,462
...before they, you know, got you.

143
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,198
From the mind that brought you hi-lo.

144
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,373
Let me show you to your room.

145
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,009
All right, I guess I am tired.

146
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,202
- Good night, Leonard.
- Sleep night.

147
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,108
I mean, obviously, good night.

148
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,478
I started to say sleep tight.
Then I changed my mind in the middle.

149
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,642
I swear to God, I'm smart.

150
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,118
Get it together, man.

151
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:18,687
All right, let me show you
some of the features of the room.

152
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,060
First, windows. Conventional.

153
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,203
Open, closed. Open, closed.

154
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,635
Halfway open, or halfway closed...

155
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,570
...depending on
your philosophical bent.

156
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,642
Over here is my comic-book collection.
Feel free to browse.

157
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,805
There's a box of disposable
reading gloves on the nightstand.

158
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,644
Good to know.

159
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,185
In here,
you'll find emergency provisions.

160
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,222
An eight-day supply
of food and water, a crossbow...

161
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,860
<i>...season two of
Star Trek: The Original Series...</i>

162
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,689
...on a high-density flash drive.

163
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,663
What if there's a disaster
that destroys all the USB ports?

164
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,599
Then there's really
no reason to live, is there?

165
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,327
Can I ask you a question
about your roommate?

166
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,099
He's an odd duck, isn't he?

167
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,338
What's his relationship status?

168
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,206
Well, there was
a misbegotten adventure...

169
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,541
...with a waitress
who lives across the hall.

170
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,775
It ended as inexplicably as it began.

171
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,249
They had very little in common
except for carnal activity.

172
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,856
That's why I acquired
these noise-canceling headphones.

173
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,358
If you decide to use them,
please clean the earpieces afterwards...

174
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,895
...with the Wet Wipes
you'll find in the bathroom.

175
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,056
They're in the drawer
labeled "Wet Wipes."

176
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:28,794
- Okay.
- Good.

177
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,129
I'll leave you
to your nighttime ablutions.

178
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,602
I've e-mailed you
the morning bathroom schedule.

179
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,140
You'll also find a laminated copy
in your welcome packet.

180
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,604
On the back of
the emergency-escape-route diagram.

181
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:42,873
How thoughtful.

182
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,710
- Sleep well, my friend.
- You too.

183
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,482
Let me just get one thing.

184
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,655
It's my backup emergency supply kit.

185
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,953
The living-room escape route
doesn't pass through here.

186
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,152
Now, good night.

187
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,456
And if there's an apocalypse,
good luck.

188
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,664
Yes?

189
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,836
- I saw your light on.
- Is everything all right?

190
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,743
Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.

191
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,438
Me neither.

192
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,444
Look what I'm reading.

193
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,014
It's you.

194
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,515
- I thought you already read it.
- I did.

195
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:23,588
But it's been a while, and I wanted
to sound smart over breakfast.

196
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,581
Aw, you're smart.

197
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,192
Oh, good. I wasn't sure
it was coming across.

198
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,590
What chapter are you on?

199
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,196
Uh, six.

200
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:36,199
Ah. The extragalactic distance ladder.

201
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,437
- Want to know a little secret?
- Sure.

202
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,836
I wrote the section on the
Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.

203
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,540
Really?

204
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,149
Sure doesn't read that way.

205
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,114
Here, let me show you.

206
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,150
When we consider the brightness
of pulsating variable stars...

207
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,382
...we start to see
a possible explanation...

208
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,495
...for some of the discrepancies
found in Hubble's constant.

209
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,392
Wow.

210
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,694
You really make science come alive.

211
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,583
Vocal test.

212
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,818
Morning vocal test.

213
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,029
Second vocal test.
Second morning vocal test.

214
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,423
- Morning, Sheldon.
- Morning.

215
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,329
- Morning, Sheldon.
- Morning.

216
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:46,438
- I trust you had a pleasant night?
- More than pleasant.

217
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,512
Excuse me.
I'm going to relieve myself.

218
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,347
- How do you take your coffee?
- Black.

219
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,281
Okeydoke.

220
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,052
Pee for Houston. Pee for Austin.

221
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,958
Pee for the state my heart got lost in.

222
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,964
And shake twice for Texas.

223
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,105
Something his mother taught him.

224
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,475
All right.
Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours.

225
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,771
The seat is down and has been
sanitized for your protection.

226
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,814
That's very thoughtful,
but I think I'll finish my coffee first.

227
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,812
Ah, so the yogurt didn't work.

228
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,117
I'll fire off a critical e-mail
to the manufacturer.

229
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,723
Oh, good, you're up.
My car won't start.

230
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:42,986
I need a ride to work.

231
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,288
Did you ignore
your check-engine light?

232
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,558
No, Mr. Smarty-pants.

233
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,759
I ignored the fill-gas-tank light.

234
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,963
Leonard, Penny wants to exploit
any feelings you have for her...

235
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,903
...in order to get a ride to work.

236
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,134
Oh, uh, sure, let me just put this
in a travel mug.

237
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,003
- Hello?
- Hi.

238
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:06,241
Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton,
a leading expert on quantum cosmology.

239
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,285
Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress
who doesn't understand...

240
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,424
...the role gasoline plays
in the internal combustion engine.

241
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,360
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

242
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,191
- Are you enjoying your stay?
- Yes, very much.

243
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,661
Good.

244
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,369
Wonderful. Meaningless
pleasantries accomplished.

245
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,939
Elizabeth, Leonard's bathroom time
is coming up...

246
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,872
...and, believe me,
you do not want to follow him.

247
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,141
Excuse me.

248
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,606
Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed
so I can take everyone to work.

249
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,277
You and Sheldon and Sheldon's friend,
Dr. Plimpton, who you just met.

250
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,853
It'll be fun.

251
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,218
Like a clown car. Heh, heh.

252
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,859
- Hang on.
- Hm, yeah? What? Huh?

253
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,555
We just broke up.

254
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:51,991
You and me? Yeah, we did.

255
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,395
Not too long ago.
How are you doing with it?

256
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,562
Not as good as you, apparently.

257
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,065
I don't follow.

258
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,965
You know, it's none of my business.

259
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,075
You wanna sleep with Sheldon's buddy
right after we broke up, go for it.

260
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,040
- Well, now...
- Excuse me.

261
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,204
I'm uncomfortable
with you recommending...

262
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,680
...Leonard pursue intercourse
with Dr. Plimpton.

263
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,718
Who, I assure you,
has better things to do.

264
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,081
I'm not recommending it.

265
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,745
I'm saying it already happened.

266
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,184
Oh, that's preposterous.

267
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,384
Tell her, Leonard.

268
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,723
Well...

269
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,028
No.

270
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,099
Oh, come on. It wasn't my fault.

271
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:36,070
The implication being that you somehow
tripped and fell into her lady parts?

272
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,602
I'm just gonna take the bus to work.

273
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,713
- Penny, I can still drive you.
- No, no, it's okay.

274
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,942
You might slip on a banana peel
and get me pregnant.

275
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,954
I must say,
I'm shocked by this betrayal.

276
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,588
I didn't betray Penny.

277
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,952
Not Penny, me.

278
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,626
How am I betraying you?

279
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:59,525
Elizabeth's my friend,
and you're playing with her.

280
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,431
Yeah, I guess I did.

281
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,076
What the hell are you doing?

282
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,976
Relax, it's Nyquil.

283
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,547
- You still have a cold?
- Maybe, but I don't care.

284
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,746
That's the great thing about Nyquil,
it's like 10 percent booze.

285
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,585
I call it the nighttime
sniffling, sneezing, coughing...

286
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,057
...so-you-can-talk-to-girls medicine.

287
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,220
Are you having trouble sleeping?

288
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,831
Because, boy, I was up all night.

289
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,465
Did you get a cold too?

290
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,001
No, I was awake all night.

291
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:45,671
If you want, I can give you
some of my mom's sleeping pills.

292
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,308
- She won't notice they're missing?
- She doesn't know she takes them.

293
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,978
No, that's okay. It was something else
keeping me up last night.

294
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,781
And again this morning.

295
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,481
And I didn't mind.

296
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:09,158
I was up last night.
I was up this morning. I didn't mind.

297
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,996
Those are your clues.

298
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,674
Ooh, ooh, did the pigeon
on your window sill have more babies?

299
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,038
- No.
- Were you making another Lego movie?

300
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,216
- No.
- Because let me tell you:

301
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:29,548
It's not enough to make the Legos move.
They also have to capture your heart.

302
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,882
Okay, I'll give you one more clue.

303
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,026
It involved another person.

304
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,052
Did you get a Japanese love pillow?

305
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,497
How is a Japanese love pillow
another person?

306
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:45,159
It is if you love her
and give her a name.

307
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,568
Dr. Plimpton,
I'd like you to meet my colleagues.

308
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,208
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

309
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,504
- And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
- Hi.

310
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,307
- I'm a big fan of your work.
- Thank you.

311
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,475
And, of course, you've already
introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.

312
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,912
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

313
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,657
Boy, I'm kind of tuckered out.

314
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,554
How are you feeling, Elizabeth?

315
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,185
You know what? I am a little tired.

316
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,763
Would you be a dear
and get me a cup of coffee?

317
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,025
Sure. Black, right?

318
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,568
Actually, now I think I want it
hot, brown and sweet.

319
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,569
Coming right up.

320
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,103
What?

321
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,715
What do you mean, "what?"
It's "Halo" night.

322
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,907
I can't. I'm too sick.

323
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,676
Go away.

324
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,351
That's why we moved
"Halo" night here.

325
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,046
I brought my mom's chicken soup.

326
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,281
I'm not hungry.

327
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,289
Don't send him away. Let him in.

328
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,226
- Who is that?
- I bought a parrot.

329
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,391
Yeah, right.

330
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,394
- Dr. Plimpton?
- Hi.

331
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,802
- Howard, right?
- Uh, yeah.

332
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,032
Can I ask you a question, Howard?

333
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,972
Do you like role-playing games?

334
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,808
Yeah, sure. Heh.

335
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,542
In fact, I'm a dungeon master.

336
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,278
Not tonight.

337
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,980
Tonight, you are a deliveryman.

338
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,490
You've brought soup but, uh-oh, Raj and I
don't have enough money to pay you.

339
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,629
So we'll have to come
to some other kind of arrangement.

340
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,132
Beg pardon?

341
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,662
You figure out the details.
I'm gonna change into something...

342
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,468
...I don't mind getting ripped off
my milky flesh.

343
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,908
What the frak?

344
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,505
Go away.

345
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,242
She wants New Delhi, not kosher deli.

346
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,513
Besides, you have a girlfriend.

347
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,187
We broke up weeks ago.

348
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,482
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I was waiting for the right time.

349
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,921
This is the right time.

350
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,928
Hey, who's ready for "Halo"?

351
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,258
Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost.

352
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,860
The numbers
are shaky enough as it is.

353
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,434
I don't understand.

354
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,203
Oh, good. Leonard's here.

355
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,964
Good?

356
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,338
Elizabeth? What's going on?

357
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,638
What's going on is you and Howard
are my moving men.

358
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,213
And Raj is my new landlord.

359
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,977
And I don't have enough money
to pay any of you.

360
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,723
Is she suggesting
what I think she's suggesting?

361
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,156
<i>Yup. Welcome to
the Renthouse Forum.</i>

362
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,119
Okay, show of hands.
Who's up for this?

363
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,822
We'll all be naked
in front of each other.

364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,228
I'm out.

365
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,794
Everybody ready?

366
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,202
Follow my lead. Almost.

367
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,874
We're going to go out into the hallway
and make a dramatic entrance.

368
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,570
Oh, good. It's so much better
when everyone commits.

369
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,806
Run, run, run. Don't look back.

370
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,817
I thought we had something special.

371
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,082
So you say you can't pay your rent?

372
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,235
- Oh, Leonard?
- Hey.

373
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,768
I found these in the dryer.

374
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,872
I'm assuming they belong to Sheldon.

375
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,273
Thanks. It's really hard
to find these in his size.

376
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,104
So listen.

377
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,011
I've been meaning to talk to you
about the other morning.

378
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,675
You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?

379
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,952
Yeah, I wanted to explain.

380
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,113
No. You don't owe me an explanation.

381
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,418
- I don't?
- No, you don't.

382
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,117
So you're not judging me?

383
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,286
Oh, I'm judging you
nine ways to Sunday...

384
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,898
...but you don't owe me
an explanation.

385
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,966
Nevertheless, I'd like to get one
on the record...

386
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,866
...so you can understand
why I did what I did.

387
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,064
I'm listening.

388
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,613
She let me.
