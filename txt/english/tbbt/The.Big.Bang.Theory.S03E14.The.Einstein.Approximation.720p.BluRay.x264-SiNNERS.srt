1
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,346
What you doing?

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,885
Attempting to view work
as a peripheral image...

3
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,922
...so as to engage
the superior colliculus of my brain.

4
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,263
Interesting. I usually just have coffee.

5
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,524
- You've been up all night?
- Is it morning?

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,931
- Yes.
- Then I've been up all night.

7
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,104
And you're stuck?

8
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:44,005
Why else would a person try to engage
their superior colliculus?

9
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,943
Uh, sorry, sweetie.
I can't help you till I've had my coffee.

10
00:00:55,389 --> 00:01:00,383
If you don't put him in his crate at night,
he just runs around the apartment.

11
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,058
What is he doing now?

12
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:09,134
Mm, he's either isolating the terms
of his formula...

13
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,294
...and examining them individually...

14
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,599
...or looking for the alligator
that swallowed his hand...

15
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,209
...after Peter Pan cut it off.

16
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:21,581
Captain Hook's hand was eaten
by a crocodile, not an alligator.

17
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,115
If you're going to mock me,
at least get your facts straight.

18
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,481
Aye, aye, captain.

19
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,223
I can't see it.

20
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,915
It just won't coalesce.

21
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,651
Maybe you need a fresh start.

22
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,560
You're right.

23
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,604
Great idea, Leonard. Thank you.

24
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:23,038
Electrons move through graphene,
act as if they have no mass.

25
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,205
How long has he been stuck?

26
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,314
Mm, intellectually, about 30 hours.

27
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,382
Emotionally, about 29 years.

28
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,983
Unit cell contains two carbon atoms.

29
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,282
Interior angle of a hexagon
is 120 degrees.

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,658
Have you tried rebooting him?

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,367
No. I think it's a firmware problem.

32
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,697
Hey, it's disco night
at the Moonlight Roller Rink tonight.

33
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,001
Who's up for getting down?

34
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,404
Oh, that's perfect.

35
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,307
Bernadette's been hawking me
to take her roller skating.

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,142
Penny likes to skate.
The four of us could double.

37
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,340
We're in.

38
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,079
Great. It's not like I brought it up
because I wanted to go.

39
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,659
- You can come with us.
- No. I don't have to go.

40
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:17,092
I'm happy just to guide you
to suitable entertainment choices.

41
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,392
I'm a walking, brown yelp.com.

42
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,865
Structure, constant structure.
One atom.

43
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,734
Boy, he's really gone, isn't he?

44
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,173
Yeah. This morning he used
a stick of butter as deodorant.

45
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:35,445
I thought I smelled popcorn.

46
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,776
The same as fermions.
Travels on a pathway.

47
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,386
Hexagonal. Always hexagonal.

48
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,753
<i>I haven't seen him this stuck since he
tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.</i>

49
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,726
Hey. Those are my lima beans.

50
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,525
Not lima beans. Carbon atoms.

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,636
But if I don't eat my lima beans,
I can't have my cookie.

52
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,203
Here. You want my peas?

53
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,863
Peas. Perfect. They can be electrons.

54
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,100
You want my corn?

55
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,301
Don't be ridiculous.

56
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,138
What would I do with corn?

57
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,043
Roller skating.
Shall we grab a bite to eat first?

58
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,244
Good. P.F. Chang's?
My mom has coupons.

59
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,082
Oh, great.

60
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:21,053
- Your mom is not coming, right?
- Not this time. I promise.

61
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,396
Just to be clear,
roller-skating was my idea.

62
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,759
I'm unhappy
that you turned it into a date...

63
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,164
...and I hope you both fall on your asses
and break your coccyxes.

64
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,837
The plural of "coccyx" is "coccyges."

65
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,603
Screw you.
Give me back my lima beans.

66
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,806
Oh, my God.
Have you ever been so embarrassed?

67
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,110
Not recently.

68
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,187
I don't know which was lamer,
their roller skating or their disco dancing.

69
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:53,486
For me, the worst part was when
people saw us leave with them.

70
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:58,329
You had some nice moves out there,
Howard.

71
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,695
- Thanks. You too.
- You noticed all the people looking at us?

72
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,305
Not really. I was in my boogie zone.

73
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:11,341
- And when Howard tried to do the splits?
- Shh.

74
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,944
Sorry, I'm moving slow.

75
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:16,105
- I think I bruised my coccyx.
- Aw, poor baby.

76
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,012
Don't tell Koothrappali.

77
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,886
- After you.
- Oh. What a gentleman.

78
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,351
Hey, Sheldon.

79
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,620
Oh, my God, are you...? Whoa!

80
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,058
Good Lord! You're ruining everything!

81
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,163
- Oh, damn.
- Are you okay?

82
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,730
Do I look okay?

83
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,799
Don't bark at me. I fell too.

84
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,903
You've been falling all night.
You're used to it.

85
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,467
Sheldon, what are you doing?

86
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,335
The same thing I've been doing.

87
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,569
Trying to figure out why electrons
have no mass...

88
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,543
- ...when traveling through graphene.
- With marbles?

89
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:52,013
I needed something bigger
than peas, now, didn't I?

90
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,655
Sheldon, when was the last time
you got any sleep?

91
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,846
Two, three days.

92
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,083
Not important. I don't need sleep.
I need answers.

93
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,754
I need to determine where
in this swamp of unbalanced formulas...

94
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,593
...squateth the toad of truth.

95
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,737
The toad of truth?
Is that a physics thing?

96
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,669
No. That's a crazy thing.

97
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,433
Okay, Sheldon.

98
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,570
What happens to our neuroreceptors
when we don't get enough REM sleep?

99
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,616
They lose their sensitivity to serotonin
and norepinephrine.

100
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,844
Which leads to...

101
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,785
Impaired cognitive function.

102
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:35,087
Right. So march in there,
brush your teeth and go to bed.

103
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,227
But I don't wanna go to bed.

104
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,059
I'm gonna count to three. One...

105
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,793
Oh, all right.

106
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,240
That was amazing
how you handled him.

107
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,401
I know how to deal
with stubborn children.

108
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,912
My mother used to run an illegal
daycare center in our basement.

109
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,595
Leonard. You're giggling in your sleep.

110
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,326
It's not me. It's my new ring tone.

111
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,403
<i>The Joker. From Batman.</i>

112
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,139
Well, it creeps me out.

113
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,434
Me too. But I paid 3 bucks for it.

114
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,271
Well, just answer the phone.

115
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,012
Hello?

116
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,644
Yeah, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

117
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,255
Yeah. He's my roommate.

118
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,492
Oh. Is he okay?

119
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,289
All right. I'll be right there.

120
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,156
What happened?

121
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,996
Sheldon's escaped
and is terrorizing the village.

122
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,130
Okay, have fun.

123
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,472
Hi. I'm Dr. Hofstadter.

124
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,477
- Where is he?
- Ball pit.

125
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,215
- Thanks for not calling the cops.
- Oh, it's no big deal.

126
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:11,448
My sister's got a kid who's special.

127
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,991
Yeah, well, he's extra special.

128
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,889
Hey, Shelly.

129
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,396
What you doing?

130
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,967
Size ratio was all wrong.
Couldn't visualize it.

131
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,331
Needed bigger carbon atoms.

132
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,140
Sure, sure.

133
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,677
How did you get into this place?

134
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,179
Back door has a five-pin tumbler system,
single circuit alarm. Child's play.

135
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,513
You can start sorting
protons and neutrons...

136
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,587
...while I build carbon atoms.

137
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,554
No, I don't think so.
We need to go home now.

138
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,824
But I'm still working.

139
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,430
If you don't come out of there,
I'm gonna have to drag you out.

140
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,664
You can try...

141
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,232
...but you'll never catch me.

142
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,429
For God sakes.

143
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,107
Sheldon, come here!

144
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,440
Buzzinga.

145
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,086
Buzzinga.

146
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,857
Buzzinga.

147
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,758
Buzzinga.

148
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,586
Buzzinga.

149
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,400
Leonard and Penny.

150
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,731
- Leonard and Penny.
- Aah!

151
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,737
What? What, what, what?

152
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,244
Leonard and Penny.

153
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,375
- What?
- I have good news.

154
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,610
And you had to barge in
and wake us up...

155
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,584
- ...in the middle of the night?
- Your cell phone was off.

156
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,054
Because we didn't
wanna be disturbed.

157
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,053
That didn't work out, did it?

158
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,425
Sheldon, what do you want?

159
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,794
I came to tell you I've got the answer.

160
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,790
Really?

161
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,062
You figured out
the graphene problem?

162
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:10,403
No, I'm still hopelessly stuck on that.
But I figured out how to figure it out.

163
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:13,444
I know I said I could handle
your roommate, but I was wrong.

164
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,910
We have to break up.

165
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,312
What are you talking about?

166
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,350
- Ahem.
- Oh.

167
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,280
Einstein.

168
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,316
Yeah. I'm gonna need a little more.

169
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,687
Albert Einstein.

170
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,326
Keep going.

171
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,968
When Einstein came up
with special relativity...

172
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,967
...he was working
at the patent office.

173
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,504
So you're gonna go work
at the patent office?

174
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,335
Oh, don't be absurd.
That's in Washington.

175
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,206
I could never live in a city
whose streets are laid out...

176
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,937
...in a wheel-and-spoke pattern.

177
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,345
No. I'm going to find
a similarly menial job...

178
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,487
...where my basal ganglia are occupied
with a routine task...

179
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,522
...freeing my prefrontal cortex
to work quietly in the background.

180
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,118
A great plan.

181
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,127
Of course. Even talking to you
is sufficiently menial.

182
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,822
I can feel the proverbial juices
starting to flow.

183
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,025
Okay.
Well, thanks for sharing with us.

184
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,830
- Good night.
- You're welcome.

185
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,404
Good night to you too.

186
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,367
Oh. By the way, I was watching you sleep
for a moment.

187
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:20,980
I noticed your snoring seems to be worse
when you're on your back.

188
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,876
No. Leonard doesn't snore.

189
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,540
No. I wasn't talking to Leonard.

190
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,688
Told you.

191
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:35,050
So, Mr. Cooper,
you're looking for a job.

192
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,388
A menial job.

193
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,259
Like yours.

194
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,562
Why, thank you for noticing.

195
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,566
I'm menial employee of the month.

196
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,210
Do you have a particular field in mind?

197
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,244
I do. For thousands of years...

198
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:58,009
...the lowest classes of the human race
have spent their lives laboring...

199
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,584
...to erect monuments
under the lash of betters.

200
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:04,518
Until finally they dropped down
and became one with the dust...

201
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,852
...through which they trudged.

202
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,290
Do you have anything like that?

203
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,730
- No.
- Shouldn't you check your database?

204
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,693
No.

205
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,108
You didn't really type.

206
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,435
I didn't really have to.

207
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,548
So how about construction?

208
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,616
Oh, that would be good.

209
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,379
Yeah, sawing, hammering,
eating out of a lunch pail...

210
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:39,423
...as my working-class fellows and I
sit perched precariously on a girder...

211
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,321
...high above the metropolis.

212
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:47,828
No, no. This is putting up sheetrock
at a housing project in Rosemead.

213
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,799
- I could do that.
- Good.

214
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,300
- One question.
- Yes?

215
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,336
What's sheetrock?

216
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,938
Moving on.

217
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,309
How about doing deliveries
for a florist?

218
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,969
That seems acceptable.

219
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,945
- Do you have your own car?
- I don't drive.

220
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,111
Of course you don't.

221
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,320
Mr. Cooper,
let me just ask you a question.

222
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,980
What was your last job?

223
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,821
Senior theoretical particle physicist
at CaITech, focusing on M Theory.

224
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,293
Or in layman's terms, string theory.

225
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,960
I see.

226
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,328
Just give me a second.

227
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,968
Security!

228
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,380
Okay.
I'll get those drinks started for you.

229
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,678
Behind you.

230
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,013
Sheldon? What the hell are you doing?

231
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,521
Trying to get these tables cleared.
We're slammed.

232
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,026
No, wait. Wait. No, wait.
What are you doing here?

233
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,857
A reasonable question.

234
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,123
I asked myself:

235
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,826
"What is the most mind-numbing,
pedestrian job conceivable?"

236
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,368
Three answers came to mind.

237
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,972
A toll booth attendant,
an Apple store genius...

238
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,875
...and what Penny does.

239
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:09,208
Now, since I don't like touching
other people's coins...

240
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:14,217
...and I refuse to contribute
to the devaluation of the word "genius"...

241
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,717
...here I am.

242
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,884
You just walked in
and they hired you?

243
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,026
- Just like that?
- Oh, heavens no.

244
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,163
Since I don't need to be paid,
I didn't need to be hired.

245
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,822
I simply came in, picked up a tray
and started working for the man.

246
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,893
Let me get that plate out of your way.

247
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,061
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.

248
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,867
Is it? Just a moment ago,
I had a minor epiphany...

249
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,203
...regarding polymer degradation
phenomenon...

250
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,573
...while scraping congealed nachos
off a plate.

251
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,408
- Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
- Thanks.

252
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:48,247
Sheldon, wait. This isn't even what I do.
I'm a waitress, not a busboy.

253
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,912
You're right. That is more menial.

254
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,688
Hello, I'm Sheldon.
I'll be your server today.

255
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,395
I don't recommend the salmon.

256
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,690
I saw it in the kitchen.

257
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,929
All right. One bacon cheeseburger...

258
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,871
...breaking two Jewish
dietary restrictions simultaneously.

259
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,907
Kudos.

260
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,069
And beer-battered fish and chips.

261
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,114
Now, here's your tartar sauce.
I also brought you salsa.

262
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,980
A little unconventional,
but I think you'll like it. It's zingy.

263
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,783
And for you, Factory Burrito Grande,
no cheese, no sour cream...

264
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,792
...no ugly consequences
from your lactose intolerance.

265
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,596
Hang on.

266
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,967
- Black beans, not pinto beans?
- Yes.

267
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,970
- Guacamole? No cilantro? Lettuce?
- Yep.

268
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,108
- Understand why I'm doing this?
- I do.

269
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,141
That'll be all.

270
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,439
That was fun.

271
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,315
How long can he keep this up?

272
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,646
I heard about this professor
who melted down, bought a van...

273
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,154
...spent the rest of his life
as a dog groomer.

274
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,985
Never went back to the university?

275
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,151
Only to shampoo
Professor Shamburg's shih tzu.

276
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,292
Sheesh.

277
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,661
You know, I bet if we all chipped in,
we could buy Sheldon a van.

278
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,328
But he's afraid of dogs.

279
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,030
Yeah. That's the only thing wrong
with that plan.

280
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,010
Hey, guys. Sorry you had to wait,
but we are swamped.

281
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,477
What's this?

282
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,172
Sheldon took our order.

283
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,682
Sheldon doesn't work here.

284
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,020
Well, honey, not to complain...

285
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,850
...but we were starting to think
you didn't either.

286
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,852
Is that really necessary?

287
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,164
Good Lord.

288
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,631
The interference pattern
in the fracture.

289
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,836
The motion of the wave
through the structure.

290
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,871
I've been looking at it all wrong.

291
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,509
I can't consider
the electrons as particles.

292
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,838
They move through the graphene
as a wave.

293
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,175
It's a wave!

294
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,882
The moment to applaud would be now.

295
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,582
Troglodytes.

296
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,227
Sheldon. Where are you going?
Aren't you gonna clean this?

297
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,330
I'm sorry, I don't work here.

298
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,906
- Happy now?
- I'm on a cloud.

299
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,173
Swing me.

300
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,080
<i>Not much between despair and ecstasy</i>

301
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,850
<i>One night in Bangkok
And the tough guys tumble</i>

302
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:42,921
<i>Can't be too careful with your company</i>

303
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:48,757
<i>I can feel the devil walking next to me</i>

304
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,204
Sheldon, come here!

305
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,405
Buzzinga.

306
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,943
Buzzinga.

307
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,953
Buzzinga.

308
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,658
Buzzinga.

309
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,799
Buzzinga.
