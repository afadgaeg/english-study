00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,641
- Five.
- Uh-huh.

- Gamma.
- I said funny.

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,445
- Upsilon?
- Heh, good one.

11
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,406
And an electrical charge.

12
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,034
- Positive.
- Ha, ha! Perfect.

167
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,715
Mm, I can already feel my cares
just melting away.

168
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,552
I'm excited to work with my boyfriend.
It's romantic.

169
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,221
Way to kill the mood.

170
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,433
Come on, Sheldon. We can be like
Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre...

171
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,852
...who spent their days
working side by side...

172
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,356
...bathed in the glow of their love
and the radium that ultimately killed her.

173
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:31,278
Screw Beauty and the Beast,
that's the love story Disney should tell.

174
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,239
Okay. What do we start with?

175
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:38,034
Maybe, uh, splicing some genes.
Clone a sheep.

176
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,371
Perhaps, uh, grow a human ear
on a mouse's back?

177
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,748
<font color="#E86CE4">(AS MICKEY MOUSE)</font>
"Ha, ha! I'm a freak."

178
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,919
Well, I'm gonna be doing
some brain stem histology...

179
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,964
...while you put yourself
on the business end of a sponge...

180
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,591
...and wash those beakers.

181
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,177
Wash those b... Oh, I get it.

182
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,973
Little hazing for the new fellow. Yeah.
Better keep an eye out for, what...

183
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,975
...shoe polish on the microscope...

184
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,894
...or mad cow disease
in my grilled cheese sandwich?

185
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,982
No, I just need those beakers washed.
Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.

186
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,235
Excuse me, you have
Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab.

187
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,987
You're gonna make him
do the dishes?

188
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,824
That's like asking the incredible Hulk
to open a pickle jar.

189
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,120
Sheldon, you've never worked in a lab
like this before.

190
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,623
You have no experience
in the field of biology.

191
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,125
I have plenty of experience in biology.

192
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,961
I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998...

193
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,882
...and it's still alive. Let's do this.

194
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,931
Where's Howard?

195
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,059
No, "Hi, Raj," no, "How are you, Raj?"

196
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,936
Just straight to,
"Where's the other white guy?"

197
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,522
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,735
So, listen, I heard something about him.
Can you keep it between us?

199
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,446
Ooh, gossip. When I first got here...

200
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,157
...I thought Americans really gossiped
around the water cooler.

201
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,369
I hung out there for a month,
but the only gossip I heard...

202
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,789
...was about some creepy guy
hanging out by the water cooler.

203
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,334
Bernadette wants to get a prenup.

204
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,337
Oh, that's a shame.
He's gonna be devastated.

205
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,631
I never know what to do
in these situations.

206
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,841
- Should I give him a heads up?
- Hmm.

207
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,386
I'm gonna give you the advice
I yell at the TV...

208
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,263
...when the Bachelor
is handing out roses.

209
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,308
Follow your heart.

210
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,311
Check it out.

211
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:33,108
Look at the size of that
Rice Krispie Treat. Same price, ha, ha.

212
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,527
Ahem, hey, Howard,
I need to tell you something.

213
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:39,197
I know, it's not on my wedding diet.
I don't care.

214
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,414
No. Listen, I heard that Bernadette's thinking
about asking you for a prenup.

215
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,708
A prenup?

216
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,751
Heh, wow.

217
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,545
What are you gonna do?

218
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,215
I don't know.

219
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,384
Follow your heart.

220
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,018
You know what?
It's not a big deal.

221
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,187
I mean,
she makes more money than me.

222
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,816
She wants to protect
her financial interests.

223
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,944
- It's completely reasonable.
- Good, that's a healthy attitude.

224
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,448
Actually, it's good for both of us.
I have assets to protect too.

225
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,533
Like what?

226
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,744
Well, I've got some rare comic books.

227
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,246
You know,
the Vespa's almost paid off.

228
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,375
Ma and I have a primo
double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai...

229
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,837
...right near the guy who played
Mr. Roper on Three's Company.

230
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,256
Mr. Roper's dead?

231
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,011
You can't just spring that on a guy.

232
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,556
Here you go.

233
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,727
This is now the only lab with glassware
washed by a man with two doctorates...

234
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,272
...and a restraining order
signed by Carl Sagan.

235
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,108
Soap spots. Wash them again.

236
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,154
You're being ridiculous.
Those are perfectly clean.

237
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,365
This beaker used to contain
cerebrospinal fluid...

238
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,618
...from an elephant
that died of syphilis.

239
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,162
If it's, in fact, perfectly clean,
drink from it.

240
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,713
Biologists are mean.

241
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,593
Perhaps this task
will be a little bit more up your alley.

242
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,763
I need you to count the bacteria spores
on these petri dishes.

243
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,098
There was something wrong
with that detergent.

244
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,268
- That was way too bubbly.
- I'm sure it was.

245
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,814
I intend to write that soap company
a strongly-worded letter.

246
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,983
Yeah, good for you.
Now start counting.

247
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,069
You know what this place needs?

248
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,863
A suggestion box.

249
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,452
Three hundred sixty-six.
Three hundred sixty-seven.

250
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,954
How's it going?

251
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,081
How's counting going?

252
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,666
When I was in kindergarten...

253
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,878
...I recited pi to a thousand places
for the school talent show.

254
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,548
- I think I got this.
- Great.

255
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,138
Aw, nuts.

256
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,226
One.

257
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,688
This is preposterous.

258
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,315
You're giving me these tasks
because you're afraid...

259
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,986
...if you give me anything meaningful
to do, I'll show you up.

260
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,029
Really? Is that what you think?

261
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,447
Yes, that's what I think.

262
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,659
And I'm super smart,
so it's probably true.

263
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,830
Hey, I've been training in the field
of neurobiology for 12 years.

264
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,542
You've been here three hours and
you spent one of them in the bathroom.

265
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:42,714
Well, I'm sorry, it takes me a while to get
things going on an unfamiliar toilet.

266
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,343
I've given you the simplest things to do
and you haven't done one of them right.

267
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,554
That's because
I'm not being challenged.

268
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,723
It's the same reason
Einstein failed math.

269
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,058
Maybe the math
was too bubbly for him.

270
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,228
You think you're doing science
by cutting up that brain?

271
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,105
They could do the same at Quiznos.

272
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,567
And they'd offer to toast it for me too.

273
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,986
Okay, smart guy.

274
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:09,157
I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus,
which is incredibly delicate work.

275
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,409
Have at it.

276
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,370
All right.

277
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,291
I'm no stranger to a little gray matter.

278
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,376
<font color="#E86CE4">(SHELDON SNIFFS)</font>

279
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:28,509
Locus coeruleus.

280
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,888
You're getting warmer.
It is indeed in the brain.

281
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,601
Hope your hands are steady.
It's the width of a single hair.

282
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,063
But this is just biology,
so it's no problem for a genius like you.

283
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,358
It's not. I will have you know
in the field of physics we work...

284
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:47,236
...with particles so small they make
fat jokes about the locus coeruleus...

285
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,783
...i.e., when your locus coeruleus
sits around the house...

286
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,077
...it sits around the house.

287
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,582
Oh.

288
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,502
- Are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?
- No.

289
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:08,341
What you see
is a man trembling with confidence.

290
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,138
Does the locus coeruleus
normally bleed that much?

291
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,724
No, but your thumb does.

292
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,980
Oh, dear.

293
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,944
Yeah, you're a biologist.

294
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,616
What are you doing here?

295
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,910
I'm on vacation.

296
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,623
Social convention dictates that I let
my hair down at a local watering hole.

297
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,295
Social convention is stupid.

298
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,340
What happened to your thumb?

299
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,509
Yeah, I have ten fingers
and ten toes.

300
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,805
If I tell you a story about each of them,
we'll be here all day. Let's move on.

301
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,599
- What can I get you?
- Ah.

302
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,729
Seeing as I'm on vacation,
a piña colada seems appropriate.

303
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,440
Extra pineapple slices,
extra whipped cream...

304
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,861
...extra cherries, extra umbrellas,
and, uh, hold the rum.

305
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,740
Don't let me have too many of those.

306
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,200
Hey. What are you guys doing here?

307
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,370
We're grown men.
We drink at bars, heh.

308
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,831
No and no.

309
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,960
Everything okay
with you and Bernadette?

310
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,463
Oh, yeah, sure.

311
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:32,175
- You and Amy? Good?
- Oh, better than good.

312
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,512
Those girls text me every detail
of their lives as it happens.

313
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,015
I'm not signing a prenup.

314
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,186
All right, Wolowitz, listen up. You
sign anything she puts in front of you.

315
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,146
You are the luckiest man alive.

316
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,107
If you let her go, there is no way
you can find anyone else.

317
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,861
Speaking on behalf of all women, it
is not gonna happen, we had a meeting.

318
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,572
And you.

319
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,533
A grown man fainting at the sight
of a little blood.

320
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:02,497
Excuse me,
this is a fairly substantial wound. You...

<font color="#E86CE4">(KNOCKING ON DOOR)</font>

322
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,754
Amy. Amy.

323
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,465
Amy.

324
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,676
What do you want?

325
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:20,848
I was kind of hoping I could continue
vacationing in your laboratory.

326
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,601
After all, I did book the whole week.

327
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,231
Do you honestly think
you can just waltz back in here...

328
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,358
...after the way you behaved
yesterday?

329
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:35,738
I was not myself.
I had lost a lot of thumb blood.

330
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,119
- That's not an apology.
- That is your opinion.

331
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,329
I want a real apology.

332
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:49,752
- I'm sorry that you weren't able to...
- No.

333
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,964
- That my genius got...
- No.

334
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,592
- That the soap was so...
- Sheldon.

335
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,054
Fine.

336
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,226
Sorry.

337
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,937
You're forgiven.

338
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,480
Now, if you wanna stay...

339
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,984
...get started on those beakers.
They're still dirty from yesterday.

340
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,490
Next year, I'm going to Epcot.

341
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,123
Are you mad at me?

342
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,041
No. I'm not mad at you.

343
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,878
I just wish you would've come to me...

344
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,590
...so I didn't have to hear it
through the nerd-vine.

345
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,011
So, what are we gonna do?

346
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,056
- You really want me to sign a prenup?
- I don't know.

347
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,392
My dad's pretty insistent on it,
though.

348
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,519
Why don't I talk to your dad?

349
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,688
- Man to man.
- Really?

350
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,900
- Oh, that'd be so great. Heh.
- Done.

351
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,030
I should probably give you a heads up
about a couple things.

352
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,659
Even though he's retired from
the police force, he still carries his gun.

353
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,705
But don't worry, he won't shoot it.
It's more of a fashion statement.

354
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,917
Okay, heh.

355
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,377
And just to be safe,
when you talk to him...

356
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,047
...don't bring up Jimmy Carter,
gardeners...

357
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,550
...foreign people, homosexuals,
Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control...

358
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,886
...organic food,
the designated hitter rule...

359
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,472
...recycling
or the fact that you're Jewish.

360
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,437
Got it, got it.
Will you e-mail me that list, heh?

361
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,275
So the thing to watch for,
if he's shouting at you, you're okay.

362
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,277
But if he starts to get real quiet...

363
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,198
...leave as quickly as you can
without making eye contact.

364
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,786
Not in a straight line,
throw some zigs and zags in there.

365
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,247
<font color="#E86CE4">(SIGHS)</font>

366
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,249
You know, this isn't that pressing.

367
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,834
Why don't I talk to him about it
in May, heh?

368
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,588
In May you're gonna be on
the International Space Station.

369
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,757
They got a phone.
