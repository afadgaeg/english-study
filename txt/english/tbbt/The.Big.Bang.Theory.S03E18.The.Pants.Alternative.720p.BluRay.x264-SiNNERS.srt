1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,837
<i>Okay, in Avatar
when they have sex on Pandora...</i>

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,530
...they hook up their ponytails.

3
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:11,166
So we know their ponytails
are like their junk.

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,835
Yeah. So?

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,981
When they ride horses
and fly on birds...

6
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,639
- ...they also use their ponytails.
- Your point?

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:22,016
My point is if I were a horse or a bird I'd
be very nervous around James Cameron.

8
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,483
It amazes me how you constantly
obsess over fictional details...

9
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,653
...when there are important things
in the world to worry about.

10
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:34,323
<i>For example, why wasn't William
Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?</i>

11
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:37,529
Hey, Sheldon,
I was up in the administration office...

12
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,332
...and I happened to overhear
the name of the winner...

13
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,441
...of the
Chancellor's Award for Science.

14
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,375
You wanna rub my nose in the fact my
contributions are being overlooked again?

15
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,913
I am the William Shatner
of theoretical physics.

16
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,041
All right, I'll play.

17
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,710
What self-important preening fraud
are they honoring this year?

18
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,049
Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that.
You.

19
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,216
- I won?
- You won.

20
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,924
I won.

21
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,359
This is astonishing.

22
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,057
Not that I won the award.
No one deserves it more.

23
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,703
Actually, I guess I misspoke.
It's not astonishing.

24
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,634
It's more like inevitable.

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,265
Not sure what to do.
Maybe call my mother.

26
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,967
Wait. I'm gonna conduct
an interview with myself...

27
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,203
...and post it online.

28
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,714
Well, good for him.

29
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,876
Yeah, the one thing
the William Shatner...

30
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:30,046
...of theoretical physics needed
was an ego boost.

31
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,497
Did it look like that spear was gonna
go right through your skull?

32
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,763
No.

33
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,507
Hey, you didn't want a Slurpee
at 7-Eleven, you don't get glasses.

34
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,772
Oh. That will be another
congratulatory call for me.

35
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,845
- Mute, please.
- Wait. Hang on. Flaming arrow.

36
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,551
Hello?

37
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,216
Oh, Chancellor Morton,
how are you, sir?

38
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,728
Yes, I was expecting your call.
Three years ago.

39
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,734
I see.

40
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,064
What happens if
I choose not to give a speech?

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,407
Uh-huh. And if I don't want to forfeit
the award?

42
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,235
Well, you've got that tied up
in a neat little bow.

43
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,247
All right, thank you.

44
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,977
- Problem.
- What?

45
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,985
They expect me to give a speech
at the banquet.

46
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,417
I can't give a speech.

47
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,084
Well, no, you're mistaken.
You give speeches all the time.

48
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,427
What you can't do is shut up.

49
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,494
Yeah, before the movie,
you did 20 minutes...

50
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,104
...on why guacamole turns brown.

51
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,940
Turned brown
while you were talking.

52
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,101
I'm perfectly comfortable speaking
to small groups.

53
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,406
I cannot speak to large crowds.

54
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,946
What to you is a large crowd?

55
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,277
Any group big enough
to trample me to death.

56
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:43,753
General rule of thumb is 36 adults
or 70 children.

57
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,926
Sheldon. Congratulations.

58
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,755
Brought you cheesecake from work.

59
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:52,956
You know, because of your award,
not because that busboy sneezed on it.

60
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,760
- I'm not accepting the award.
- Why not?

61
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,964
Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper
has stage fright.

62
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,631
That's no reason to back out.

63
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,970
I once got a pretty big
honor in high school.

64
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,943
I was terrified about appearing
in front of a big crowd...

65
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,106
...but I went through with it.
You know?

66
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,116
The world looked pretty darn good
sitting on a haystack...

67
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:17,552
...in the back of a Ford F-150 as a
member of the corn queen's court.

68
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,724
Thank you. I'll bear that in mind...

69
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,625
...if I'm ever nominated
for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.

70
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,064
- Sheldon, you're being ridiculous.
- Am I?

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,828
Let me tell you a story.

72
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,168
Where's 70 children
when you need them?

73
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:40,507
I was 14 and graduating
summa cum laude from college.

74
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,672
"Summa cum laude" is Latin
for "with highest honors."

75
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,843
I just love how you always skip over
the part where no one asks.

76
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,013
I was valedictorian
and expected to give an address.

77
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,022
Even now I can remember
that moment...

78
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:56,185
...when I walked up to the podium
and looked out at the crowd.

79
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,331
There must have been
thousands of people.

80
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,591
My heart started pounding
in my chest.

81
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,098
I began to hyperventilate.

82
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,669
My vision became blurry,
and before I knew it...

83
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,704
Oh, dear.

84
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,369
- Oh, my God.
- Sheldon?

85
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,843
- Sheldon, are you okay?
- Don't trample me.

86
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,351
Come on, Mother, you know
why I can't accept the award.

87
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,217
With all due respect,
I don't think praying will help.

88
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:29,061
No, I have not heard the song
"Jesus, Take the Wheel."

89
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,721
No, no, no.
You don't need to start singing it.

90
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,232
Yes, I'll buy it on "the iTunes,"
Mother.

91
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,461
Goodbye, Mother.

92
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,341
Hello.

93
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,870
- Sit down. We wanna talk to you.
- Am I in trouble?

94
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,983
Did my mother call you?

95
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,413
Just sit.

96
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,745
We think we can help you
with your stage fright.

97
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,719
Oh, I doubt that.

98
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:01,418
I haven't figured out a way
and I'm much smarter than all of you.

99
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,757
Yes, but you're not smarter
than all of us put together.

100
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,094
Oh, I'm sorry.
That is what I meant.

101
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,662
Okay. Your problem is
you're trying to do this all by yourself.

102
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,774
We could help you.
We can be your team.

103
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,376
Like Professor Xavier
and his X-Men.

104
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,875
I do like the X-Men.

105
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,111
<i>Did I see X-Men?</i>

106
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,778
Yeah, we watched it last week.
You said you liked it.

107
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,947
Oh, I say a lot of things, sweetie.

108
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,423
So how about it, Sheldon?

109
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:40,430
I don't know. If you're my X-Men,
what are your powers?

110
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,865
Okay, well, I'm gonna take you
shopping, get you a nice suit.

111
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:47,029
- Might give you more confidence.
- It's not exactly a mutation...

112
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:50,438
...that would get you into Xavier's
School for Gifted Youngsters...

113
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,100
...but go on. Leonard?

114
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,215
I thought I could try to analyze you
and get to the root of your anxiety.

115
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,544
What qualifies you to attempt
to understand my mind?

116
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,153
My mother is a highly regarded
psychiatrist...

117
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,313
...and I've been in therapy
ever since...

118
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,654
...she accused me
of breast feeding co-dependently.

119
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,960
And Raj says he can teach you...
What did you call it?

120
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,331
I don't know,
some Indian meditation crap.

121
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,334
I see. I assume since the rest of you
have set the bar so low...

122
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,343
...you're saving the most impressive
contribution for last.

123
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,505
Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.

124
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:35,415
My power is the ability to pretend
like I give a damn...

125
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,183
...about your piddly-ass problems.

126
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,658
And that's 24/7, buddy.

127
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,767
And I appreciate the pretense.

128
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:54,037
So, what do you say, Sheldon?
Are we your X-Men?

129
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,439
No. The X-Men were named
for the X in Charles Xavier.

130
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,877
Since I am Sheldon Cooper,
you will be my C-Men.

131
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,052
Oh, that's not a good name.

132
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,862
Okay, Sheldon...

133
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,522
...I'm going to be leading you through
a series of meditation exercises.

134
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,533
These methods come
from the ancient gurus of India...

135
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,866
...and have helped me
overcome my own fears.

136
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,075
And yet you can't speak to women.

137
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,543
But thanks to meditation...

138
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,376
...I'm able to stay in the same room
with them without urinating.

139
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,551
Now, ahem, close your eyes.

140
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,384
Okay, but don't punch me.

141
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,826
- What?
- When I was little my sister would say:

142
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,929
"Close your eyes,
you'll get a surprise."

143
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,758
And then she'd punch me.

144
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,427
- I'm not going to punch you.
- That's what my sister used to say.

145
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,934
- Look, do you wanna do this or not?
- I'm sorry. Proceed.

146
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,768
All right, ahem...

147
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,844
...imagine yourself in the one place
you feel most at home.

148
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,608
- Where is that?
- SimCity.

149
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:17,584
More specifically, the SimCity
I designed, Sheldonopolis.

150
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,121
Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.

151
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,761
Where exactly? Sheldon Square?

152
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:27,559
Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium,
home of the fighting Sheldons?

153
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,123
Whatever you like.

154
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,862
I thought this was supposed to be
guided meditation.

155
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,700
Fine, you're in Sheldon Square.

156
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,206
Really? This time of the year?
It's a bit nippy.

157
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,308
Then put on a sweater.

158
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,975
Suppose I could run downtown
and pick up something at Shel-Mart.

159
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,615
Yeah. Whatever.
Just go buy a sweater.

160
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:51,280
The nice thing about Shel-Mart is
I own it, so I get a 15 percent discount.

161
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,123
You own the damn thing,
just take a freaking sweater.

162
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,126
I didn't turn a profit last quarter...

163
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,164
...by taking product off the shelves
willy-nilly.

164
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,597
All right.

165
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,995
You've paid for a sweater
and you're in Sheldon Square.

166
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,740
Ahem. Hang on.

167
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,140
It's a cardigan, I have to button it.

168
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,750
- Oh, no.
- What now?

169
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,751
A Godzilla-like monster
is approaching the city.

170
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,152
I have to get my people to safety.

171
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,691
People of Sheldonopolis,
this is your mayor.

172
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:28,850
Follow me.

173
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,862
If the children can't run,
leave them behind.

174
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,830
Oh, the simulated horror.

175
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,272
Raj?

176
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,707
Just as I suspected.

177
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,012
Meditation is nothing but hokum.

178
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,158
I question your premise.

179
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,229
How is a new suit going to prevent me
from passing out...

180
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,366
...in front of a ballroom
full of people?

181
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,728
It'll give you confidence.

182
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,893
Sometimes when I'm feeling
stressed out...

183
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,732
...I go out and buy a cute top
or a fun skirt...

184
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,034
...and I have a whole new outlook
on life.

185
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,739
Don't you eventually realize
you're the same stressed-out person...

186
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,904
...in a cute top or a fun skirt?

187
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,509
Yeah, that's when I buy shoes.

188
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,648
Now, let's see what we got.

189
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,914
Oh. This is nice.

190
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,752
It's only one color.

191
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,224
Yes, so?

192
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,356
That's a lot of money
for only one color.

193
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,825
Fine. Why don't you pick out
what you like?

194
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,597
Hmm.

195
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,600
This is pretty sharp.

196
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,043
No. You're wrong.

197
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,411
This is great.

198
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,452
I had a suit like this when I was six.

199
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,757
Okay, I think we have a winner.

200
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:14,559
- Where the hell did you find that?
- In the prom department.

201
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,962
It's ridiculous.

202
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,730
Says the former member
of the corn queen's court.

203
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:24,410
- Please just try this one on?
- Okay.

204
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,104
But anything I put on now
is only gonna suffer in comparison.

205
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,449
This is absurd. I look like a clown.

206
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,095
So, Sheldon...

207
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,962
...how you doing?

208
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,596
That's how you start
a psychotherapy session?

209
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,636
How am I doing?

210
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,264
I was promised a riverboat journey
into the jungles of my subconscious.

211
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,172
Instead I get the same question...

212
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,644
...I hear from the lady
who slices my bologna at Ralph's.

213
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,348
I'm sorry. I'll start again.

214
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:10,012
Would it be helpful to you
if I told you about my dreams?

215
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,017
Um... I don't know, maybe.

216
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:17,026
I recently had a dream
that I was a giant.

217
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:22,156
But everything around me
was to scale so it all looked normal.

218
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,872
Well, how did you know you were
a giant if everything was to scale?

219
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,307
I was wearing size a million pants.

220
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,484
- Why don't we just talk?
- Ah. The talking cure.

221
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,210
Classical Freudian. Good choice.

222
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,378
If it will help speed things along...

223
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,719
...my answers to the standard
Rorschach inkblot test are:

224
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:51,557
A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat...

225
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:56,464
...and D, my father killing my mother
with a hypodermic needle.

226
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,365
Why don't I just start?

227
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,905
Sometimes people have trouble
accepting accolades...

228
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,912
...if on a subconscious level,
they don't feel they deserve them.

229
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,550
Do you think maybe
that's what's happening here?

230
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,583
Really, Leonard?

231
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:19,021
You just going to try to recycle Adler's
doctrine of the inferiority complex?

232
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,922
I could probably get that
from the woman at Ralph's.

233
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,587
And she'd let me taste some pieces
of cheese for free.

234
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,928
But it could be part of your problem.
Let me give you an example.

235
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:33,732
When I was 8, I won a ribbon
at the science fair for my project...

236
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,932
...Do Lima Beans Grow Better
to Classical Music.

237
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,079
But my mother pointed out
that it was just a rehash...

238
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,611
...of my brother's earlier...

239
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:44,511
...Do Lima Beans Grow Worse
to Rock 'n ' Roll.

240
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,913
I felt so guilty
I gave the ribbon back.

241
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,421
And how did that make you feel?

242
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,754
Terrible.

243
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,395
I worked really hard on that project.

244
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,623
I stayed up all night singing
the clown's aria from Pagliacci...

245
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,462
...to a lima bean sprout.

246
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,568
Go on.

247
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,465
It wasn't my fault.

248
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,610
I had never seen
my brother's project.

249
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,803
And my mother could've told me
before...

250
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,743
...instead of at the ceremony
in front of everyone.

251
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:22,085
So I hear you saying you're angry
with your mother.

252
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,316
Damn right,
I'm angry with my mother.

253
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,432
For God's sake,
I was 8 years old.

254
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,624
She humiliated me.

255
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,566
That's when the bed-wetting
started again.

256
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,941
- Thank you, Leonard.
- For what?

257
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,340
If someone as damaged as you
can find his way...

258
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,342
...to crawl out of bed each morning...

259
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,812
...I think I can face
a simple awards ceremony.

260
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,012
Wait, that's it?
I thought we had a whole hour.

261
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,323
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

262
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,689
It is my great honor
to introduce the winner...

263
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:07,321
...of this year's Chancellor's Award
for Science, and my good friend...

264
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,865
...Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

265
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,031
But before I do,
I'd like to share with you a letter...

266
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,370
...from Sheldon's mother,
who couldn't be here tonight.

267
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:21,479
Isn't that nice?
His mother sent him a letter.

268
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,512
She's proud of him.

269
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,981
Wonder what that feels like.

270
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,712
"Dear Shelly."

271
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,882
That's what she calls him.
Shelly. It's a pet name.

272
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,893
You know what my mother's
pet name for me is? Leonard.

273
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,997
But I digress.

274
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,731
- "Dear Shelly, I am so proud..."
- Oh, dear.

275
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,736
- What's the matter?
- I'm getting dizzy.

276
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,707
Don't worry.
You're surrounded by your C-Men.

277
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,843
I can't do this. I'm going to faint.

278
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,880
All right, drink this. It'll relax you.

279
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,713
- Alcohol? I don't drink alcohol.
- Fine, faint.

280
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,857
I don't feel different.
This alcohol's defective.

281
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,224
Here. See if this one works.

282
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:19,531
First of all,
the projects were totally different.

283
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,101
I was showing that classical music
nurtures lima beans...

284
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,904
...and makes them grow.
But my mother didn't hear me.

285
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,206
If you look at the relationship
between nurturing and growth...

286
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:33,443
...I'd like to point out that my brother
is 8 inches taller than me.

287
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,918
I'm ready!

288
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:38,946
Right.

289
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,216
Ladies and gentlemen,
our guest of honor...

290
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,793
...Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

291
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,566
Thanks, shorty. I'll take it from here.

292
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,793
All right,
you people ready to have some fun?

293
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,462
You have an understanding
of differential calculus...

294
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,801
...and at least one year
of algebraic topology?

295
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,443
Well, here come the jokes.

296
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,613
Why did the chicken
cross the Mobius strip?

297
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,616
To get to the same side?
Buzzinga.

298
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,987
A neutron walks into a bar and asks,
"How much for a drink?"

299
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,590
The bartender says,
"For you, no charge."

300
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,995
Hello? I know you're out there.

301
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:26,468
I can hear you metabolizing oxygen
and expelling carbon dioxide.

302
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,468
It looks like we have some
academic dignitaries in the audience.

303
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,510
Dr. Randall
from the geology department...

304
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,170
...only man who's happy
when they take his work for granite.

305
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,146
Bada-cha.

306
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,150
I kid the geologists, of course...

307
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,154
...but it's only because
I have no respect for the field.

308
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,021
Let's get serious for a moment.

309
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,698
Why are we all here?

310
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,528
Because we're scientists.

311
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,627
And what do scientists study?

312
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,363
The universe.

313
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,371
And what's the universe made of?

314
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,806
I am so glad you asked.

315
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,142
<i>There's antimony, arsenic
Aluminum, selenium</i>

316
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,375
<i>Hydrogen and oxygen
And nitrogen and rhenium</i>

317
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,849
<i>And nickel, neodymium
Neptunium, germanium</i>

318
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,045
Everybody!

319
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,055
<i>And Iron, americium
Ruthenium, uranium</i>

320
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:22,217
<i>Europium, zirconium
Lutetium, vanadium</i>

321
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,487
Just the Asians!

322
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,030
<i>And lanthanum and osmium
And astatine and radium</i>

323
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,373
Penny, Leonard.

324
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,513
Would you be able to answer
some questions I'm having...

325
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,248
...about the events of last night?

326
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,859
- Sure.
- Question one.

327
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,018
Where are my pants?

328
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,488
You might wanna check YouTube.

329
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:05,537
- What do I search?
- It's already loaded. Just hit play.

330
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,567
<i>All right, people,
let's get down to the math.</i>

331
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:16,010
<i>It Is only three-dimensional thinking
that limits our imagination.</i>

332
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,548
<i>Can I take my pants off
over my head?</i>

333
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,787
<i>Of course not,
my body's In the way.</i>

334
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:28,552
<i>But If we had access
to higher dimensions...</i>

335
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,255
<i>...we could move our pants
around our bodies...</i>

336
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,594
<i>...through the fourth dimension...</i>

337

00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,542
