1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,802
All right, that's the last servo.

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:07,171
Behold the Mobile
Omnidirectional Neutralization

3
00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:09,146
and Termination Eradicator.

4
00:00:09,662 --> 00:00:10,545
Or...

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,670
MONTE.

6
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:16,056
Featuring one articulated
razor-sharp killing saw,

7
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:18,315
one polycarbonate grinding
and flipping wheel,

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,439
steel-armor plate exoskeleton
top and bottom,

9
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:23,479
and enough horsepower to drive
a 110 pounds of mechanized death

10
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:26,311
from zero to holy crap
in 4.8 seconds.

11
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:30,640
Is it wrong to say
I love our killer robot?

12
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:34,458
As with my father,
I both love and fear it.

13
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:38,161
All right, enough chitchat.
Let's destroy something.

14
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:40,548
One, two, three.

15
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:43,796
What shall be first to taste
the wrath of MONTE?

16
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:45,664
Maybe we should start small.

17
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,250
Perhaps today is the day

18
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,324
we finally find out
what's inside the Magic Eight Ball.

19
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:53,872
Did it when I was four.

20
00:00:53,997 --> 00:00:57,138
It's an icosahedral die
floating in tinted blue water.

21
00:00:57,854 --> 00:01:01,304
Man, call "spoiler alert"
before you say things like that.

22
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:03,770
How about the toaster oven?

23
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,913
What did the toaster oven
ever do to you?

24
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:08,476
What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins
in the third grade?

25
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,277
He still punched me in the face
with my own fists.

26
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:13,475
Sorry, little nerd,

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,672
you were just in the wrong boys' room
at the wrong time.

28
00:01:17,385 --> 00:01:18,835
Gentlemen, goggles.

29
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:21,545
This is an auspicious moment.

30
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,571
Like Robert Oppenheimer
or Neil Armstrong,

31
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:28,341
we need the appropriate words
to mark this historic scientific event.

32
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:32,256
How about "Die, toaster, die"?

33
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:35,339
That'll do it.

34
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,878
All right, what's next?

35
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,336
No, I think I'm just going
to stay in tonight and do laundry.

36
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,781
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

37
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:32,886
This door got the full MONTE.

38
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,626
What the hell?

39
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:39,417
Killer robot.
We built it.

40
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,680
Yeah, well, it almost killed me.

41
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,542
If it wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead.

42
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:50,710
So, who exactly
does it want to kill?

43
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:54,160
I'm sorry, are you
unaware of the upcoming

44
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,195
Southern California
Robot Fighting League

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,070
Round Robin Invitational?

46
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:03,181
You know, since I moved last year,
not all my mail has been forwarded.

47
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a big deal.

48
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:10,453
There's an awards banquet
and a dance afterward.

49
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:13,436
Perhaps you'd like to come with me.

50
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:18,504
I know the other fellas would be
really excited to see a girl there.

51
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:22,056
How is it supposed to be a dance
if I'm the only girl?

52
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,904
Well, that may be
a slight exaggeration.

53
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:27,245
You'd be the only doable girl.

54
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,555
You are a pig, Howard.

55
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:35,498
How is "doable" anything
but a compliment?

56
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:38,303
- Why don't we just work on the robot?
- Please, not now.

57
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:41,578
Once again, Penny and I
have begun our little tango.

58
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,300
Our tango?

59
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,433
The carnal repartee,
the erotic to and fro.

60
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,925
But as delicious
as the appetizer might be,

61
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,572
at some point
we will have to succumb

62
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:56,242
and eat the entrï¿½e
while it's still...

63
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:03,976
... hot.

64
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,520
I'm begging you, stop talking.

65
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:13,163
Look, normally
I can just ignore you.

66
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:15,967
I get it... you're a little peculiar.
Like Sheldon.

67
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,705
Excuse me, Penny, but in this room,
you're the one who's peculiar.

68
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:23,457
You might be right.

69
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,560
But back to you.
I know you think you're some sort

70
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:28,920
of smooth-talking ladies' man,
but the truth is,

71
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:31,019
you are just pathetic and creepy.

72
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:35,737
So what are you saying?

73
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,210
I am saying it is not a compliment
to call me "doable."

74
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,723
It's not sexy to stare
at my ass and say,

75
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:46,057
"It must be jelly 'cause
jam don't shake like that."

76
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:48,890
And most important,
we are not dancing a tango,

77
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:50,538
we're not to'ing and fro'ing.

78
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,124
Nothing is ever going
to happen between us. Ever.

79
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:55,861
Wait a minute.

80
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,455
This isn't flirting.
You're serious.

81
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:01,196
Flirting?
You think I'm flirting with you?

82
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:04,364
I am not flirting with you.
No woman is ever gonna flirt with you.

83
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:06,863
You're just gonna
grow old and die alone.

84
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:12,800
Thanks for the heads up.

85
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:16,007
Where you going?

86
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:19,309
I'm going home to live
my creepy, pathetic life.

87
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:26,157
Someone had to say it.

88
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:31,871
What?

89
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:36,357
He said maybe we should enter you
in the killer robot competition.

90
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:54,313
Howard, the phone is ringing!

91
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:58,822
Here's a crazy idea, Ma: Answer it!

92
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:04,341
All right, hold on.

93
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:06,218
It's your friend, Leonard!

94
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:09,517
He wants to know why
you're not at school today!

95
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:13,126
I don't go to school, Ma.

96
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,034
I work at a university.

97
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,807
That's a school!
Now pick up the phone!

98
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,169
I don't want to talk to anybody.

99
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:24,423
Should I ask Leonard to bring
over your homework?!

100
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,376
I don't have homework.

101
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,810
I'm a grown man with a master's
degree in engineering!

102
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:33,665
Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants.

103
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:36,778
Want me to get you a Popsicle?

104
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:38,366
Cherry, please!

105
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,505
I ate the cherry.
All that's left is green.

106
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:46,825
You make me want to kill myself.

107
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:49,729
- What's going on?
- I don't know,

108
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:51,993
now they're just yelling
about Popsicles.

109
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:57,154
- Sounds like Penny really got to him.
- I'm not surprised.

110
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,126
Despite his hard and crusty shell,
Howard is a very sensitive man.

111
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:02,169
Do you know he writes poetry?

112
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:06,659
Mostly about men from Nantucket
and hermits named Dave,

113
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:09,763
but he does it
with real sensitivity.

114
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,448
Hey, Hofstadter.

115
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:14,390
Word around the pwasma wab
is you built a wobot?

116
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:18,005
- Yes, we did, Kripke.
- His name is MONTE.

117
00:07:18,378 --> 00:07:20,466
Well, if you have any dewusions
about entering him

118
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:22,458
against my wobot,
the Kwipke Kwippler

119
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,678
in the Southern California
Robot Fighting League

120
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:27,796
Wound Wobin Invitational,
aka the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.,

121
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:30,481
his name is gonna be Scwap Metal.

122
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:33,493
Come on, is that really necessary?

123
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:35,303
Leonard, I believe it is.

124
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:36,774
This is trash talk,

125
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:40,666
and trash talk is a traditional
component in all sporting events.

126
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:43,268
Kripke,

127
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,338
your robot is inferior

128
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,090
and it will be defeated by ours

129
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:50,612
because ours exceeds yours
in both design and execution.

130
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,681
Also, I'm given to understand
that your mother is overweight.

131
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,877
Oh, snap.

132
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,442
Of course, if that is the result
of a glandular condition

133
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,213
and not sloth and gluttony,
I withdraw that comment.

134
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,861
What difference does it make?
Fat is fat.

135
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:10,799
There are boundaries.

136
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:14,089
Tell you what,
forget the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.

137
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:17,867
Wet's settle this <i>woboto a woboto</i>.

138
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,206
What do you mean?

139
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,665
There's no guarantee
we're gonna go against each other

140
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,001
in the Wound Wobin,
so let's throw down.

141
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:26,003
You know,

142
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,706
unless you're afwaid.

143
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:31,634
We accept your challenge.
Name a time and place.

144
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:34,293
- Tomorrow, 3:00, the kinetics wab.
- Make it so.

145
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:35,922
No, don't make it so.

146
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:39,308
Barry, we can't fight you tomorrow.
Our engineer is incapacitated.

147
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:40,768
What's wrong with him?

148
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:44,529
He's depressed because he's pathetic
and creepy and can't get girls.

149
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:48,909
We're all pathetic and cweepy
and can't get girls.

150
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:52,323
That's why we fight wobots.

151
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,852
If you're not there,
you'll be exposed to widicule.

152
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:03,328
I'm curious, what part of America
is that accent from?

153
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:11,782
- You got a minute?
- Yeah, come on in.

154
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:13,070
What's up?

155
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:15,830
- I need you to apologize to How...
- Get out.

156
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:20,600
Come on. He won't come out of his house
and we need him for a robot battle.

157
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,049
Well, then have the robot
go and get him.

158
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:24,812
The robot didn't hurt his feelings.

159
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,760
His feelings needed to be hurt.

160
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,817
He's been in bed for two days.

161
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,948
Probably with a blow-up doll.

162
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:33,977
He's not with a...

163
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:37,054
Does it really matter
who or what he's with?

164
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,769
The guy is devastated.

165
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,454
Please, how could I possibly
devastate Howard?

166
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:45,577
Okay, don't take this as a criticism,
but you kind of have

167
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:48,669
that overexposed-to-gamma-rays
thing going on.

168
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,289
What does that mean?

169
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:53,660
You know, like, most of the time,
you're the easygoing Bruce Banner,

170
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:57,335
but then, when you get angry,
you kind of turn into, like, you know?

171
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:01,986
I turn into a bear?

172
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:07,049
Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner?
You didn't get The Incredible Hulk?

173
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:10,791
Never mind.
Just, please go talk to him.

174
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:11,859
And say what?

175
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,945
That I didn't mean it,
because I meant it.

176
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,787
Maybe you can go at it
from a different angle,

177
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:19,814
like, you see a
glimmer of goodness in him

178
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,003
and you only said what you said
because you want to

179
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:25,164
nurture it and make it shine.

180
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:32,054
Okay, let's try it this way.

181
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:34,153
Remember the day
we met and you asked me

182
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:37,279
to go to your boyfriend's
apartment to get your TV back

183
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:41,254
and he was nine feet tall and he took
my pants off and you said...

184
00:10:42,153 --> 00:10:43,779
What was that?
What did you say?

185
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:46,590
Oh, yes.
You said you owed me one.

186
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:49,773
Okay, come on, that's not fair.

187
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,764
I came home with no pants.

188
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,613
Fine, I'll go over there tomorrow.

189
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:58,402
Thank you.

190
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,370
I should probably give you
a heads up about his mother.

191
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,925
What about her?

192
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:07,858
She's a delightful woman.
You'll love her.

193
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:15,172
<i>Howard, there's a blonde girl,
Patsy, here to see you!</i>

194
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:17,391
Who?

195
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:19,469
<i>Okay, now she's saying it's Penny.</i>

196
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:22,931
I don't wanna talk to her.

197
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,286
Ma!

198
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:27,117
<i>She ran past me.</i>

199
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:29,290
<i>Was I supposed to tackle her?</i>

200
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:34,609
So, I just came by
to see how you were doing.

201
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:36,079
I'm fine.

202
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:38,265
Good.

203
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:40,657
Your mom seems nice.

204
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:44,156
People move away from her
on the bus.

205
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:48,075
What do you want?

206
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:54,118
I just want to apologize.

207
00:11:57,703 --> 00:11:59,853
For some things that I have said.

208
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,764
About you.

209
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,685
I've been informed
that you have feelings.

210
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:13,899
And apparently, I have hurt them.

211
00:12:15,441 --> 00:12:17,235
So, I'm sorry.

212
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,263
Fine. You're sorry.
Good-bye.

213
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,497
So... you're okay?

214
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:30,514
Hey, I'm a big boy.

215
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,429
I'm not traumatized
by some random comment

216
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:35,139
from some random woman.

217
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:37,903
I mean, get over yourself.

218
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:44,258
Bye.

219
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:52,579
So close.

220
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,551
Oh, my God.
That's Kripke's robot?

221
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,581
<i>As you can see, the Kwippler is weducing
the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.</i>

222
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:11,039
I can't watch anymore.

223
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,632
Sheldon, we have to call it off.

224
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,042
We don't have that option.

225
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,295
We've accepted the challenge.
We can't run away from a fight.

226
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,812
Please, we've spent our whole lives
running away from fights.

227
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:24,177
Personally, I can squeeze
through a hole in a fence half my size.

228
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:28,651
Impressive as that may be,
MONTE is not us.

229
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:30,709
MONTE has no fear.

230
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,853
Didn't we watch the same video?

231
00:13:33,316 --> 00:13:37,036
Kripke's robot just had angry sex
with a mid-sized automobile.

232
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,672
You are overlooking the fact
we know what we're up against

233
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:43,136
and we can modify MONTE
so that he's prepared.

234
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:44,512
You wanna prepare him?

235
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:47,742
Install a bladder and a pair of shorts
so he can wet himself.

236
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:51,621
Excuse me, but how are we gonna make
any modifications without Wolowitz?

237
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,037
- Have you heard from Penny?
- Not yet.

238
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:56,697
Have faith, gentlemen.
We don't need Wolowitz.

239
00:13:56,822 --> 00:14:00,272
Engineering is merely
the slow younger brother of physics.

240
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:02,787
Watch and learn.

241
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:09,598
Do either of you know
how to open the toolbox?

242
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,438
And then, when I was 14,

243
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:17,790
I met Marcy Grossman.

244
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:20,248
She was so beautiful.

245
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:23,482
She just got her braces off

246
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,845
but they left a little
of the overbite.

247
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:28,900
It was so hot.

248
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:33,036
Like a sexy little chipmunk.

249
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:40,091
I didn't have the courage

250
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:42,047
to ask her out,

251
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:44,067
but I dedicated a song to her

252
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:46,426
at the ninth grade talent show.

253
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,379
That sounds sweet.

254
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:51,404
<i>Marcy Grossman is sunshine</i>

255
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:54,687
<i>On a cloudy day</i>

256
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:58,702
<i>When it's cold outside</i>

257
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:02,067
<i>Marcy Grossman is the month of May</i>

258
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,419
It's cute.

259
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:05,153
<i>I guess</i>

260
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,722
<i>You'd say</i>

261
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,256
<i>What can make me feel this way</i>

262
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:16,028
<i>Marcy Grossman,
Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman</i>

263
00:15:16,153 --> 00:15:18,585
<i>Talkin' 'bout Marcy</i>

264
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,634
That's great.

265
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,461
<i>... Grossman.</i>

266
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,109
It's fun.

267
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:27,742
And then she came up
with that sexy little chipmunk mouth

268
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:29,990
and spit in my hair.

269
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:36,746
Which brings us to tenth grade.

270
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:40,937
Do you think maybe sometimes

271
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:42,816
you try too hard?

272
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:46,131
Look at me.

273
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:50,463
What chance do I have
if I don't try too hard?

274
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:54,345
You'd have a terrific chance.

275
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,256
I mean, you're smart, you're funny.
You have a cool job.

276
00:15:57,381 --> 00:16:00,081
You build stuff
that goes into outer space.

277
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:01,007
I guess.

278
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,380
I'm telling you,
I've known you for a year and a half

279
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,714
and this is the first time
I feel like I'm talking

280
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,233
to a real person.

281
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:09,718
And you know what? I like him.

282
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:11,682
He's a nice guy.

283
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:14,514
You really think so?

284
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:17,968
I don't know.

285
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,046
I do.

286
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:38,784
Nice little bot you've got here.

287
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:39,944
I'm aware.

288
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:42,891
What's this do, spin?

289
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:45,406
Yep. At 3400 RPM.

290
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,342
It can cut through steel
like it was wubber.

291
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:51,381
Neat.

292
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:54,054
Good work.

293
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:56,473
Sheldon, we've gotta call this off.

294
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,066
No, Leonard.

295
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:00,559
For years,
merciless thugs like Kripke

296
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:02,754
have made my life
a series of painful noogies

297
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,577
and humiliating wedgies

298
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:07,275
and the insensitively named
Indian burns.

299
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,903
That stops now.

300
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,379
But we don't have a chance.

301
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:13,445
The only improvement
you were able to make

302
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,867
was to put fresh batteries
in the remote.

303
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,579
What you fail to realize is
Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw:

304
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:22,344
overconfidence
from his robot's massive size

305
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:24,125
and its overwhelming power.

306
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,952
That's not overconfidence.
That's observation.

307
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:31,005
Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey
to my psychological warfare.

308
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,352
Observe.

309
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:39,130
I would ask if your robot
is prepared to meet its maker,

310
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:42,185
but as you are its maker,
clearly the two of you have met.

311
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,694
What is his pwoblem?

312
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:53,363
Way to bust out
the Jedi mind tricks, dude.

313
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:56,898
I just wanna make sure
we're all clear.

314
00:17:57,023 --> 00:17:59,862
Standard robotic fighting
league rules apply.

315
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,238
Are you cwazy?

316
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:04,317
This is a stweet fight.
The stweet has no rules.

317
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,460
He's right, Leonard.
The paradigm is to the death.

318
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,670
I will, however,

319
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,502
give you the opportunity
to concede my superiority now

320
00:18:11,627 --> 00:18:14,427
and offer me your robot
as the spoils of war.

321
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,438
Never.

322
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,847
I'd rather see MONTE dead
than in your hands.

323
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,017
That could be easily arranged.

324
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,851
Ready, set, go?

325
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,311
- Do it.
- All right then.

326
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:27,942
Weady. Set. Go.

327
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:35,107
- Come on, Sheldon, you got this.
- Indeed.

328
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:37,490
We are prepared for anything
he can throw at us.

329
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:46,312
That's new.

330
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,169
Run, MONTE, run!

331
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,502
Run, MONTE!

332
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,423
Go, go, go, go!

333
00:18:56,446 --> 00:18:59,227
Don't hurt us, don't hurt us,
don't hurt us!

334
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:06,890
Well, so much for making up

335
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:09,564
for the emotional wounds
of childhood.

336
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:12,300
I did this.

337
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,904
MONTE was killed
by my hubris and my pride.

338
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:18,398
No matter what anybody says,
this is my fault.

339
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,623
No one's arguing with you, dude.

340
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,612
I got your text. How bad is...

341
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:28,333
Forget the robot.
What happened to you?

342
00:19:29,524 --> 00:19:31,565
- He slipped and fell.
- Yes,

343
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,296
I slipped and fell.

344
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:34,823
In the bathroom.

345
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:36,952
Bounced right off the tub.

346
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,491
Now he knows what bathtubs
are capable of doing

347
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:42,472
when you don't treat them
with respect.

348
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:47,644
They sucker punch you
when your eyes are closed.

349
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:51,433
So what do you think, Howard?

350
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,399
It's not that bad, right?

351
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:56,945
A little electrical tape,
some solder...

352
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,459
Are you insane?

353
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,603
I've seen space probes
that crashed into the desert

354
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:03,409
that were in better shape than this.

355
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,111
You're right.

356
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:07,609
MONTE's gone.

357
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:11,209
We'll bury him in the morning.
A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

358
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,060
Leonard, you'll play your cello.

359
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:17,085
Honey, aren't you getting
a little carried away?

360
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,133
I mean, it's just a toy robot.

361
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:23,429
"Just a toy robot"?

362
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,063
I know, I got it.

363
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,543
Sheldon, I'm sorry.

364
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,154
Don't get the wrong idea.

365
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,968
The way I see it,
I'm halfway to pity sex.
