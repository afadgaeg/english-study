1
00:00:00,377 --> 00:00:02,630
Let's see,
Raj was the kung paoï¿½chicken.

2
00:00:02,905 --> 00:00:05,038
- I'm the dumplings.
- Yes, you are.

3
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:08,077
Creepy, Howard.

4
00:00:08,863 --> 00:00:10,221
Creepy good or creepy bad?

5
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,605
Who was the shrimp
with lobster sauce?

6
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:17,125
That would be me.
Come to papa, you un-kosher delight.

7
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:21,232
I'm not necessarily
talking to the food.

8
00:00:26,992 --> 00:00:28,171
Sit over there.

9
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:34,546
Sit over there.

10
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:45,471
Baby wipe?

11
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:48,593
- Why do you have...
- No, don't ask! Don't!

12
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:51,462
I'll tell you why.

13
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:54,902
I had to sanitize my hands
because the university

14
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:58,060
replaced the paper towels
in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.

15
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:00,235
I thought the blowers
were more sanitary.

16
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:01,856
- Really, don't.
- Why...?

17
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:05,030
Hot air blowers
are incubators and spewers

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,931
of bacteria and pestilence.

19
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:08,551
Frankly, it'd be more hygienic

20
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:11,661
if they had a plague-infested gibbon
sneeze my hands dry.

21
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:15,093
Hey, guys, I just got
the most amazing news...

22
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:21,542
Do you think you'll ever be able to talk
in front of me without being drunk?

23
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:25,781
Okay, I'll just,

24
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,359
go eat by myself.

25
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:28,841
You don't have to do that.

26
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:32,053
It's okay, between him not talking,
him talking and him...

27
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,494
I'm better off alone.

28
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,393
Good-bye, you poor,
strange little man.

29
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:45,934
She's so considerate.

30
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:47,474
What's your news?

31
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:50,337
Remember that little planetary object
I spotted beyond the Kuiper Belt?

32
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,636
Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ Sub-17.

33
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:55,045
Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood.

34
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:58,969
Anyway, because of my discovery,
<i>People magazine </i>is naming me

35
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:00,957
one of their 30 under 30 to watch.

36
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:02,792
Congratulations.

37
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:04,416
That's incredible.

38
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:05,536
Excuse me,

39
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:08,606
30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

40
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:12,437
30 visionaries under 30 years of age

41
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:15,841
to watch as they challenge
the preconceptions of their fields.

42
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,468
If I had a million guesses,
I never would have gotten that.

43
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:23,735
They've got me in with a guy who's doing
something about hunger in Indonesia,

44
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:26,820
and a psychotherapist who's using
dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners,

45
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,270
and Ellen Page,

46
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,867
star of the charming
independent film, <i>Juno</i>.

47
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:33,764
I'd so do her.

48
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,949
You'd do the dolphins.

49
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:41,247
Do I get an honorable
mention for designing

50
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,374
the telescope camera
mounting bracket you used?

51
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,586
Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative

52
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,921
in which a humble boy from New Delhi

53
00:02:49,124 --> 00:02:50,712
overcame poverty and prejudice

54
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:53,483
and journeyed to America
to reach for the stars.

55
00:02:53,712 --> 00:02:55,687
Poverty?
Your father's a gynecologist.

56
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:57,214
He drives a Bentley.

57
00:02:58,487 --> 00:02:59,599
It's a lease.

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,219
I'm confused.

59
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:06,937
Was there some sort
of peer review committee

60
00:03:07,057 --> 00:03:09,233
to determine which scientists
would be included?

61
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,389
Peer review?
It's <i>People magazine</i>.

62
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:12,795
<i>People</i> picked me.

63
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:16,539
- What people?
- The people from <i>People</i>.

64
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:20,475
But exactly who are these people?
What are their credentials?

65
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,017
How are they qualified?

66
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:24,672
What makes accidentally
noticing a hunk of rock

67
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:27,813
that's been traipsing around
the solar system for billions of years

68
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:30,783
more noteworthy than any other
scientific accomplishment

69
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:32,340
made by someone under 30?

70
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,260
Boy, I'll bet Ellen Page's friends
aren't giving her this kind of crap.

71
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,656
Are you proud of yourself?

72
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,479
In general, yes.

73
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:05,998
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

74
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:16,801
There's my missing neutrino.

75
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:19,705
You were hiding from me
as an unbalanced charge,

76
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:22,302
weren't you,
you little sub-atomic dickens?

77
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:26,185
Hey, look,
I found my missing neutrino.

78
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:28,979
Oh good, we can take it
off the milk carton.

79
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:33,405
We're going to apologize to Raj
and invite him out to dinner.

80
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:35,027
Apologize for what?

81
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,698
He came over last night
with some pretty good news

82
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,407
and we weren't very supportive.

83
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,951
I sense you're trying
to tell me something.

84
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,651
You were a colossal asshat.

85
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,006
No, I beg to differ.

86
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:53,045
Of the three of us, I was by far
the most supportive.

87
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:54,787
Really? Do tell.

88
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,717
How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?

89
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:00,552
When I was 11,

90
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:03,668
my sister bought our father
a "World's Greatest Dad" coffee mug

91
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:06,675
and, frankly, the man coasted
until the day he died.

92
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:09,965
Okay, let's try it this way.

93
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:13,107
What if this <i>People magazine</i> thing
is the best he's ever gonna achieve?

94
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,276
I had not considered that.

95
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,820
Come on.

96
00:05:18,473 --> 00:05:21,080
I often forget
other people have limitations.

97
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:22,544
It's so sad.

98
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,245
- He can feel sadness?
- Not really.

99
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:28,455
It's what you and I
would call condescension.

100
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:33,485
Now when we go in there,
let's show Raj that we're happy for him.

101
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:34,697
But I'm not.

102
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,090
Well, then fake it.

103
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:40,495
Look at me.
I could be grinding on the fact

104
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:42,817
that without my stabilizing
telescope mount

105
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:46,765
he never would have found that stupid,
little clump of cosmic schmutz.

106
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:50,435
But I'm bigger than that.

107
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:52,605
Fine.
What do you want me to do?

108
00:05:53,444 --> 00:05:54,481
Smile.

109
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:05,254
Crap, that's terrifying.

110
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:09,788
We're here to see Koothrappali,
not kill Batman.

111
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:13,750
Try less teeth.

112
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:20,837
Close enough.
Come on.

113
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:25,346
- Hey, Raj.
- Hey, guys. What's up?

114
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:27,640
We just wanted
to invite you out to dinner.

115
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:30,277
To celebrate your
"30 under 30" thing.

116
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:31,554
Right, Sheldon?

117
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,608
That's very nice of you.
I would like that.

118
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:39,432
Hello, boys.
Dr. Gablehauser.

119
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:41,172
- Dr. Koothrappali.
- Dr. Gablehauser.

120
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,921
- Dr. Hofstader.
- Dr. Gablehauser.

121
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,488
- Dr. Cooper.
- Dr. Gablehauser.

122
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:45,803
Mr. Wolowitz.

123
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:50,246
Boys, I've got a question for you:
Who in this room

124
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:51,807
discovered a star?

125
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:54,583
Actually, 2008-NQ Sub-17
is a planetary body.

126
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:57,266
I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about me.

127
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,619
You, my exotic young friend,

128
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:01,231
are my star.

129
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:05,196
But you didn't discover him.
You merely noticed he was here,

130
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:08,012
much like he did
with 2008-NQ Sub-17.

131
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:10,182
Sorry.

132
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:15,593
Boy, we've got to get you
into a better office.

133
00:07:15,713 --> 00:07:17,523
Something more suited
to your status.

134
00:07:17,683 --> 00:07:19,271
You don't have to go to any trouble.

135
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:21,193
How about Von Gerlich's old office?

136
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:23,680
I'd rather have Fishbein's.
It's bigger.

137
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,630
Wait a minute,
I called dibs on Fishbein's office

138
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,698
the day he started showing up
at work in his bathrobe.

139
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:33,706
He gets a new office, I can't even get
paper towels in the men's room?

140
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,417
Damn, this is hard.

141
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:44,185
Let me ask you something.

142
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:47,021
What do you think
the business of this place is?

143
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:53,684
- Science?
- Money.

144
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:54,810
Told you.

145
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:58,616
And this boy's picture
in <i>People magazine</i>

146
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:00,899
is gonna raise us a pile
of money taller than...

147
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:03,402
well, taller than you.

148
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:06,864
I have a Master's degree.

149
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:08,286
Who doesn't?

150
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,466
Have you ever had lunch
in the president's dining room?

151
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:16,090
I didn't even know there was
a president's dining room.

152
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,819
It's the same food
as the cafeteria, only fresh.

153
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,961
- Come on, little buddy.
- Okay, big buddy.

154
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:23,111
See you tonight, guys.

155
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,766
You can stop smiling now.

156
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,418
So anyway, after a fantastic lunch,

157
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:36,073
I was whisked off
to the <i>People magazine</i> photo shoot...

158
00:08:36,193 --> 00:08:38,599
Have any of you boys
ever been to a photo shoot?

159
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:40,189
It's fantastic.

160
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,188
Apparently,
the camera loves me and I, it.

161
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:49,086
They shot me in front of a starry
background where I posed like this.

162
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:57,174
They're going to digitally add
a supernova.

163
00:08:57,294 --> 00:08:59,958
They say it's the perfect metaphor
for my incandescent talent.

164
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,313
Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas
that collapses upon itself.

165
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:09,168
Excuse me.
Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor.

166
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:10,666
Go for Koothrappali.

167
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:13,179
They gave him an assistant?

168
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,691
If I want a new pen, I have to go
to the bank with wire cutters.

169
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:20,092
Have we at this point
met our social obligations?

170
00:09:20,212 --> 00:09:21,105
Not yet.

171
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:22,858
Okay, just put it on my calendar,

172
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,985
but start thinking of a reason
why I can't go.

173
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,949
All righty?
Koothrappali out.

174
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:30,305
God bless that boy.
I don't know what I'd do without him.

175
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:32,074
You just got him this afternoon.

176
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:35,146
Yes, but I'm finding
that having a lackey suits me.

177
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,327
A lackey?

178
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:39,153
I'm sorry.
Is that politically incorrect?

179
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:41,660
In India, we just call them
untouchables.

180
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,199
- Now?
- Almost.

181
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:48,262
Speaking of untouchables,
I've got great news for you guys.

182
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,842
<i>People magazine</i> is having
a reception this Saturday

183
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:53,637
and I managed to get you invited.

184
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:56,263
- Gee, thanks.
- You're welcome.

185
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:59,077
Of course, I couldn't get you
into the VIP section

186
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:00,822
because, you know, that's for VIPs

187
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:03,204
and you guys are just,
you know... P's.

188
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,914
There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea

189
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:10,220
where, when a hunter
flaunts his success

190
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,565
to the rest of the village,
they kill him

191
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:15,718
and drive away evil spirits
with a drum made of his skin.

192
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:17,410
Superstious nonsense, of course,

193
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:19,476
but one can see their point.

194
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:30,089
Here you go, Raj.
You might want to drink this one slowly.

195
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,218
So, Saturday night,
can I count on my posse?

196
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:36,597
Gee, I'd love to, Raj,
but I can't make it.

197
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:42,339
No, I could...

198
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,771
I can make it. But I won't.

199
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:50,287
What are you talking about?

200
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:53,022
There's a reception
for my magazine article on Saturday.

201
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:54,651
And you guys aren't going?

202
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:58,229
I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating
a tremendous accomplishment

203
00:10:58,349 --> 00:11:00,423
and you're not even going
to support him?

204
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:03,753
A tremendous accomplishment would be
if the planetary body he discovered

205
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:06,960
were plummeting toward Earth
and he exploded it with his mind.

206
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:11,180
That would be cool.
I'd go to that reception.

207
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:14,920
Come on, this is huge.
Raj is gonna be in <i>People magazine</i>,

208
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,263
and he didn't even have to knock up
one of the Spears sisters.

209
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:21,024
Would you like to go with me?

210
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:23,477
Of course I would.
I would be honored.

211
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:25,020
Really? Cool.

212
00:11:25,524 --> 00:11:27,052
Shame on you guys.

213
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:32,535
Look at that,
I got a date with Penny.

214
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:35,531
I can't believe
it took you a whole year.

215
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:38,823
- Now?
- Now.

216
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:45,752
Hey, buddy,

217
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,751
I'm going to be
in <i>People magazine</i>.

218
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:50,152
Yeah, call me
when you're on the cover.

219
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,192
Raj, look at you!

220
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:06,696
I know. I'm resplendent
like the noonday sun, am I not?

221
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:12,025
Yeah. Starting with the champagne
a little early, aren't you?

222
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:14,568
It was in the limo.
They sent a limo.

223
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:17,055
I have a limo.
I just love saying "limo."

224
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,868
- Sip on it while you're getting ready.
- I'm ready.

225
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:23,537
That's what you're wearing?

226
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:27,291
Why, what's wrong with it?

227
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:30,807
Nothing. I was just hoping
for something a little more, you know,

228
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,396
ridonkulous.

229
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:42,959
Yeah. Well, this is all the donkulous
you're gonna get tonight.

230
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,180
Okey-dokey, let's roll.

231
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:49,522
All right, it's time
to raise the roof!

232
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:53,401
- Hey, Leonard.
- Dude.

233
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,004
You look very nice.

234
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:56,280
Thank you.

235
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:01,108
- Come on. Good night.
- Good night.

236
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:03,701
Hey, Leonard, do you
see my limo downstairs?

237
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:07,415
It's bigger than the house
my grandfather grew up in.

238
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:10,126
- Terrific.
- It has more food, too.

239
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:12,092
Come on. Come on.

240
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:27,100
Good news. You don't have to sulk
about Penny anymore.

241
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:30,931
There are hundreds of Croatian women
just waiting for you to contact them.

242
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,540
Anything-for-a-greencard.com?

243
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:40,367
I'll lend you my user name.
It's "Wealthy Big Penis."

244
00:13:42,314 --> 00:13:43,478
You're joking.

245
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:46,562
You gotta make it easy for 'em.
They're just learning English.

246
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:49,171
Pass.

247
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,292
So you're just gonna
sit around here and mope

248
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:54,574
while Penny is out with Dr. Apu
from the Kwik-E Mart?

249
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:58,382
It's not a date,
and that's racist.

250
00:13:58,542 --> 00:13:59,800
It can't be racist.

251
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,100
He's a beloved character
on <i>The Simpsons</i>.

252
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,954
Let's just eat
so I can get to bed.

253
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:09,373
With any luck, tonight will be the night
my sleep apnea kills me.

254
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,675
Did you ask for the chicken
with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?

255
00:14:16,795 --> 00:14:18,882
Even though the menu description
specifies "shredded"?

256
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:20,457
Brown rice, not white?

257
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:23,006
Did you stop at the Korean grocery
and get the good hot mustard?

258
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:25,302
Did you pick up the low sodium
soy sauce from the market?

259
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:27,244
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

260
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,299
What took you so long?

261
00:14:32,014 --> 00:14:34,045
- Just sit down and eat.
- Fine.

262
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:40,424
All right, it's shredded.
What do you want me to do?

263
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,037
I want you to check
before you accept the order.

264
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:44,157
Sorry.

265
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:47,900
Were you distracted by the possibility
that Koothrappali

266
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,226
might have intercourse
with Penny tonight?

267
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,045
He's not going to have
intercourse with Penny.

268
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:57,489
Then there's no excuse
for this chicken.

269
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,622
You know, this situation
with Koothrappali

270
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:04,031
brings to mind
a story from my childhood.

271
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,048
Oh, goody, more tales
from the panhandle.

272
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:09,742
That's northwest Texas.
I'm from east Texas,

273
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:12,875
the Gulf region,
home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.

274
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:16,043
Do the shrimpers feature
in your story?

275
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,735
Anyway,
when I was eight,

276
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,946
a Montgomery Ward delivery van
ran over our family cat Lucky.

277
00:15:28,187 --> 00:15:29,890
- Lucky?
- Yes, Lucky.

278
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,527
He's irony-impaired.
Just move on.

279
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:36,565
Dead cat named Lucky.
Continue.

280
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,441
While others mourned Lucky,

281
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:40,486
I realized his untimely demise

282
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,886
provided me with the opportunity
to replace him

283
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:45,071
with something more suited
to my pet needs:

284
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:48,391
a faithful companion
that I could snuggle with at night,

285
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:51,846
yet would be capable of killing
upon telepathic command.

286
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:55,503
So not a puppy?

287
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:58,127
Please, nothing so pedestrian.

288
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:00,303
I wanted a griffin.

289
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:03,211
A griffin?

290
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,592
Yes, half eagle, half lion.

291
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:08,150
And mythological.

292
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:10,973
Irrelevant.

293
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,727
I was studying
recombinant DNA technology,

294
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:17,861
and I was confidant I could create one,
but my parents were unwilling

295
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:20,678
to secure the necessary
eagle eggs and lion semen.

296
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:26,423
Of course, my sister got swimming
lessons when she wanted them.

297
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:32,968
Not that we don't all enjoy
a good lion semen story,

298
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,244
- but what's your point?
- My point is

299
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,003
if Koothrappali is moving on

300
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,218
to a new life
of shallow undeserved fame,

301
00:16:42,338 --> 00:16:45,298
perhaps this is an opportunity
to create a better cohort.

302
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,890
You want to breed a new friend?

303
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:51,597
That's one option,
but who has the time?

304
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:55,309
But consider this--
the Japanese are doing

305
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:57,591
some wonderful work
with artificial intelligence.

306
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:00,098
Now, you combine that
with some animatronics

307
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:01,924
from the imagineers over at Disney,

308
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:03,839
next thing you know,
we're playing Halo

309
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,804
with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.

310
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:10,125
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.

311
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:13,502
That may well be, but the fact is

312
00:17:13,622 --> 00:17:15,663
it wouldn't kill us
to meet some new people.

313
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:18,749
For the record, it could kill us
to meet new people.

314
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:24,222
They could be murderers
or the carriers of unusual pathogens.

315
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:27,579
And I'm not insane.
My mother had me tested.

316
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:32,977
If we do get a new friend,

317
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:35,943
- he should be a guy who has your back.
- He should have a lot of money

318
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:39,186
and live in a cool place by the beach
where we could throw parties.

319
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:42,701
- And share our love of technology.
- And he should know a lot of women.

320
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,832
Let's see, money,
women, technology.

321
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:49,363
Okay, we're agreed.
Our new friend is going to be Iron Man.

322
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,109
Welcome to the Raj Mahal.

323
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,917
It's very nice.
Good night.

324
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,169
- Wait. The evening's not over.
- Yes, it is.

325
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:08,472
No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly
and suck face.

326
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,301
Is the evening over?

327
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:13,910
Wait, wait, wait!

328
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,116
That's my mommy and daddy
calling from India.

329
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:19,058
- I want you to meet my parents.
- Wait. Meet them?

330
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,855
Hello, Mommy, Daddy.
Good to see you.

331
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:25,853
How are you?
I'm not drunk.

332
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,185
- <i>Why would you say that?</i>
- Just making conversation.

333
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,364
Mommy, Daddy, I want you
to meet my new squeeze, Penny.

334
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,112
I'm not your squeeze.
There is no squeezing.

335
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:39,163
<i>I can't see her.
Center her in the frame.</i>

336
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,068
Here you go. Cute, huh?

337
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:43,857
<i>She's not Indian.</i>

338
00:18:44,714 --> 00:18:47,283
<i>So she's not Indian.
The boy is just sowing some wild oats.</i>

339
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:50,423
There's no sowing, no squeezing
and no sucking face.

340
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:53,406
<i>What if he gets her pregnant?</i>

341
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:56,804
<i>Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want
as the mother of your grandchildren?</i>

342
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:59,974
What right do you have to pick
with whom I can have children with?

343
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:02,548
<i>Look, Rajesh, I understand,
you're in America.</i>

344
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:04,642
<i>You want to try
the "local cuisine."</i>

345
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:08,748
<i>Trust me.
You don't want it for a steady diet.</i>

346
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:12,113
Now you listen to me.
I am no longer a child

347
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:14,226
and I will not be
spoken to like one.

348
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:16,825
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go throw up.

349
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,662
- <i>What's wrong with him?</i>
- I don't know.

350
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:23,755
Maybe it's the local cuisine.

351
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,008
Well, it's nice to meet you.

352
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,092
I'm just gonna
set you on down over here.

353
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:37,137
And I'm gonna leave, so...

354
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,443
<i>namaste.</i>

355
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,091
And FYI, you'd be lucky
to have me as a daughter-in-law.

356
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:49,002
She's feisty.

357
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:50,777
I like that.

358
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:03,100
Raj, what are you doing?

359
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:09,420
No notes. If you have
something to say to me, say it.

360
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:25,931
Sorry.

361
00:20:28,683 --> 00:20:30,399
Sweetie, it's okay.
