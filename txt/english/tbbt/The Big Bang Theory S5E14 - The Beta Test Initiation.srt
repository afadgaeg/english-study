<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: Hello.

2
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,345
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper...

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,682
...and welcome to the premiere episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,018
Fun with Flags.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,687
Over the next 52 weeks...

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:27,026
...you and I are going to explore
the dynamic world of vexillology.

7
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:31,321
Hang on, Dr. C. What's vexillology?

8
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,326
Vexillology is the study of flags.

9
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,245
Cool.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,707
I think I just learned something.

11
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,085
- Did you have fun doing it?
- I'll say.

12
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:50,049
Fun and information
are two sides to this video podcast.

13
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,678
Not unlike the only two-sided state flag:
Oregon.

14
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,473
Oh, look.

15
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,933
Hello, Mr. Beaver.

16
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:04,480
In future episodes,
we'll answer some burning questions.

17
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,732
What's the only non-rectangular flag?

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,526
What animal appears most often on flags?

19
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,988
What animal appears second most often
on flags?

20
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,990
And more.

21
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,701
Sweet.

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,871
Why are you waving a white flag?

23
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,083
I'm surrendering to fun.

<font color="#E86CE4">(BOTH CHUCKLE)</font>

25
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,760
Now, today's episode of Fun with Flags
is not fun...

26
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,512
...but it is important.

27
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,098
Flags, you gotta know how to hold them...

28
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,600
...you gotta know how to fold them.

29
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,062
Let's start by identifying
the parts of our flag.

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,067
- This edge is the hoist and it's used to...
- Excuse me. Sorry, excuse me.

31
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,319
Cut.

32
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,196
Did you not see we are rolling?

33
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,907
I'm having dinner with Penny.
I have to get out of here.

34
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,911
And I have flag knowledge
that I have to get out of here.

35

<font color="#E86CE4">(BOTH SIGH)</font>

36
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,044
- You okay?
- No, I'm a little rattled.

37
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,089
But like the flag over Fort Sumter,
I'm still here.

38
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,176
And take two.

39
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,806
Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper...

40
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,184
...and welcome to the premiere episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:

41
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,311
Fun with Flags.

42
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,188
Over the next 52 weeks...

43
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:33,652
...you and I are going to explore
the dynamic world of vexillology.

44
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:38,407
Hang on, Dr. Cooper.
What's vexillology?

45
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,119
Vexillology is...
Why is there a face on that flag?

46
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,872
It's Ferdinand T. Flag.

47
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,666
I thought he might help
bring in some younger viewers.

48
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:52,004
Confound it, you're right.
It's brilliant. Let's take it from the top.

49
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,488
That was a really nice dinner.

50
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,659
- I'm glad you asked me out again.
- Me too. I missed you.

51
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,578
You see me all the time.

52
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,830
You sure you just don't miss the sex?

00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,040
<font color="#E86CE4">(LEONARD CHUCKLES)</font>

54
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,711
Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great.
Have you ever tried it? Heh, heh.

55
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,924
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
I have. You are not wrong.

56
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:41,511
If we're gonna try dating again,
we should take things slow.

57
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,389
Oh, I can take it slow.

58
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,809
Did I tell you about my girlfriend
in high school, Karen Berberick?

59
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:51,063
To this day she doesn't know
we were going out.

60
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,651
Made it easier on her
when I broke things off.

61
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,321
Okay, well, maybe not that slow.

62
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,864
How about this:

63
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,701
Are you familiar with the typical
development for computer software?

64
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,371
You know, just for fun,
let's say I'm not.

65
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,166
Before an application is released,
they give it a trial run.

66
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,876
We could do that.

67
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,255
And if we hit a rough spot,
instead of getting mad, we say:

68
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,592
"Hey, we found a bug"
and report it, so it can be fixed.

69
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,678
You mean like a beta test?

70
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,973
Technically, this would be an alpha test.

71
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,309
A beta test requires people that
weren't involved in the develop...

72
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,312
Seriously? Do I not get credit
for knowing beta test?

73
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,441
No, you should. Absolutely.
That was me being pedantic.

74
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,735
And that's our first bug.

75
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,698
You reported it, I can fix that.
See? This is good.

76
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,325
All right. Let's give it a shot.

77
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,621
Great. You keep a list, I'll keep a list,
at some point, we'll exchange.

78
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,500
- Okay. Good night, Leonard.
- Night.

79
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,007
Attaboy, Hofstadter.

80
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:04,428
Nothing gets the ladies hotter
than software development analogies.

81
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,974
- Hey, I'm back.
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: Cut.

82
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,522
Take 47.

83
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,611
Well, here's an interesting fact
about flags.

84
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,905
I will take that action.

85
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:28,201
"The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti
were identical by coincidence.

86
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,788
A fact that wasn't discovered
until they competed against each other...

87
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,166
...at the 1936 Olympics."

88
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,878
And thankfully, their embarrassment
was overshadowed by rise of Fascism.

89
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,132
Let's see the new phone.

90
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,842
I stopped on the way to work.

91
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,012
Hey. Do you wanna
peel the plastic off with me?

92
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,432
Really? Me?

93
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,144
- That's, like, the best part.
- Grab a corner.

94
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,230
Whoa, what's your hurry, cowboy?

95
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,733
Savor the moment.

96
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,289
Oh, yeah.

97
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,377
Speaking of cowboys...

98
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,798
...do you know what country
has not one, but two cows on its flag?

99
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,342
The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra.

100
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,178
Ooh! The next classic episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:

101
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,722
Fun With Flags is writing itself.

102
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,893
Oh, let me try the voice recognition.

103
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,480
Hey, I let you peel the plastic,
don't get greedy.

104
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,777
- Hello?

My name? It's Siri.

108
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:54,371
Look at that. There's finally a woman
in your life you can talk to.

109
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,207
Are you single?

110
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,586
I don't have a marital status,
if that's what you're asking.

111
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,048
Yeah, you're right, that's too personal.
We hardly know each other.

112
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,844
How about a cup of coffee?

113
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,679
I found six coffee shops.

114
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,765
Three of them are fairly close to you.

115
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,185
I will see you gentlemen later.

116
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,860
She is gonna break his heart.

117
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,995
For someone who has a machine
that can travel anywhere in time...

118
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,790
...Doctor Who sure does have a thing
for modern-day London.

119
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,795
Careful. It's that kind of sass
that can get a person uninvited...

120
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,547
...to this year's Who Con.

121
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,344
We're not counting this as a date,
are we?

122
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:58,018
I'm... I'm not sure,
but I think the right answer here is "no."

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,401
...than hanging out at home,

126
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,404
Even Doctor Who?

127
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,532
- Even Doctor Who.
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: All right, that's it.

129
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,331
Okay, bug report taken.

130
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,709
Next time, I will have a better plan
for our evening's activity.

131
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,753
Well, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

132
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,423
Yeah. Oh, wait. Here. Almost forgot.

133
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,217
- Here.
- What's this?

134
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,510
My bug report to you.

135
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,979
Well, it's quite a list you got there.

136
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,440
It's color-coded.

137
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,777
Red means "fix right away."

138
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,990
Yellow is "whenever you get a chance."

139
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,786
And green is "I could probably learn
to live with it."

140
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,123
There's a key down here at the bottom.
It's neat, huh?

141
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,752
Yep.

142
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,381
So have a good night.

143
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,218
Yep.

144
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,597
Look at that.

145
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:21,101
Someday, we will tell future generations
that dating used to be hard.

146
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,773
What's baffling me is what you
could have possibly put on the list.

147
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,942
Hair too golden?

148
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,778
Laugh too musical?

149
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,365
World too much a better place
for her mere presence in it?

150
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,661
How about constantly talks
with food in her mouth?

151
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,124
Her heart's full of love,
no one cares what's in her mouth.

152
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,464
So, Siri...

153
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,301
...what's happening? How are you?

154
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,679
I am well.

155
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,973
What are you doing right now?

156
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,768
What am I doing? I'm talking with you.

157
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,522
You have a beautiful voice.

158
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,359
Thank you. It's nice to be appreciated.

159
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,195
I bet it is.

160
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,283
Why don't women like me?

161
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,785
Let me check on that.

162
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,000
How about a web search
for "Why don't women like me?"

163
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,878
Well, no need. I've already done that.

164
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,215
Uh, Siri, do you have a last name?

165
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,842
My name is Siri.

166
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,011
Ah, one name.

167
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,140
Like Cher, Madonna, Adele.

168
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,684
All the women who rock me.

169
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,022
My name is Rajesh,
but you can call me Raj.

170
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,900
Would you like me to call you "Raj"?

171

I'd like you to call me "sexy."

172
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,991
From now on, I'll call you "sexy." Okay?

173
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,703
Okay.

174
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,046
Siri, I'm in the mood for gelato.

175
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,675
I found 10 restaurants
whose reviews mention gelato.

176
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,552
Seven of them are fairly close to you.

177
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,596
Thank you, darling.

178
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,600
You're most certainly welcome, sexy.

179
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,524
- Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.
- I'm sorry?

180
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,235
You've taken
a great evolutionary leap...

181
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,446
...by abandoning human interaction
and allowing yourself...

182
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,242
...to romantically bond
with a soulless machine.

183
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,369
Kudos.

184
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,538
I haven't bonded with it.

185
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,249
Oh, no, of course. I understand.

186
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,627
You're afraid the world isn't ready
for your taboo love.

to make my famous popovers.

196
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,745
All right, I'll remind you.

198
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,499

I'm sorry, Bawwy.

201
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,597
I don't understand
"wecommend a westauwant."

202
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,605
Listen to me.
Not restaurant. Restaurant.

203
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:00,612
I don't know what you mean
by "Not westauwant. Westauwant."

204

See? Total crap. You suck, Siri.

She's a lady.

- No, I can't.

Two Weeks to Rock-Hard Abs.

They kind of spoil the ending
right in the name of that, don't they?

All right. Look.
Just remember how this works.

218
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,545
We don't get mad about these things.

219
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:02,340
Speaking of which, I've addressed
your bug report on my date planning.

220
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,010

It's kind of a surprise.

221
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,889
All right, terrific. Let me just go
find a pair of shoes that aren't so tall.

228

It was an expression of passion...

229

as "juicy and weird," who wants that?

No, never mind. It's right here.

I was just talking to Siri
about Peking duck...

237
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,621
...she said she knew
about four Chinese grocers...

238
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,873
...two of which are fairly close to me.

Who's Siri?
Is he dating somebody new?

00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,300
Yes. His phone.

242
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,138
Is that cute or creepy?

243
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,515
Uh-huh.

244
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,853
Can I pour you some wine?
I think you'll enjoy it.

245
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,023
Traditional choice with Peking duck
is a sauvignon blanc...

246
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,859
...but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling.

247
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,152
I wasn't sure...

248
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,198
...but I didn't wanna have an argument
with her in the middle of Trader Joe's.

249
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,872
Now, what should we put Siri in
for dinner?

250
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,541
