1
00:00:00,288 --> 00:00:02,677
So you see, what you're eating
is not technically yogurt,

2
00:00:02,797 --> 00:00:05,232
because it doesn't have
enough live acidophilus cultures.

3
00:00:05,352 --> 00:00:08,443
It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.

4
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:10,096
That's very interesting.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,145
It's also not pink
and has no berries.

6
00:00:14,907 --> 00:00:17,145
Yeah, but it doesn't
really answer my question.

7
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:20,208
- What was your question again?
- Do you want some?

8
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,401
- Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
- Right.

9
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:26,529
- So, gas.
- Yeah, got it.

10
00:00:27,437 --> 00:00:29,366
Well... good night.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,733
What are you doing?

12
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:47,157
There's a draft.

13
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:49,801
I didn't feel a draft.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,549
Why don't we just go into, your...

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,976
Yeah, you know what, maybe
we should slow things down a little.

16
00:00:57,137 --> 00:00:59,125
I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to...

17
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:00,879
- go fast.
- No, I know.

18
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:04,816
I know what you meant, it's just...
this is only our first date.

19
00:01:04,984 --> 00:01:06,264
Okay, sure, no problem.

20
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:08,821
Why don't we just figure out
where we're going

21
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:10,965
and when we want to get there,

22
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:14,006
and then rate of speed
equals distance over time.

23
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:18,038
Solve for R.

24
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,334
Or we could just wing it.

25
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:23,943
That might work, too.

26
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,368
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

27
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:33,710
He's coming. Screensaver!

28
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:41,874
Hey, Leonard.
How was your date?

29
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,738
Bite me.

30
00:01:45,715 --> 00:01:49,111
Sheldon, how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me?

31
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:50,457
They were clever.

32
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,824
They exploited my complete lack
of interest in what you were doing.

33
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:58,353
You should thank us.
When future generations try to determine

34
00:01:58,473 --> 00:02:01,211
why your relationship
with Penny crashed and burned,

35
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,387
this right here is the black box.

36
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:07,003
What are you talking about?
The date went fine.

37
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:09,005
She said she wants
to slow things down.

38
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:12,097
Okay, so she said
she wants to slow things down.

39
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:16,024
It's like saying,
"I'm really enjoying this meal.

40
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:18,287
"I'm going to slow down
and savor it."

41
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:21,681
No, it's like,
"This fish tastes bad,

42
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:25,716
"so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out."

43
00:02:27,977 --> 00:02:30,277
- You being the fish.
- I'm not the fish.

44
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,457
Really?
Did you make a second date?

45
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,698
No, we sort of decided to wing it.

46
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:36,560
Even I know that's lame.

47
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,771
Okay, all right,
let's assume your hypothesis.

48
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:44,249
We went to dinner, we talked,
we laughed, we kissed.

49
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,419
Where could I have possibly gone wrong?

50
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:49,370
Think back, Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.

51
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,380
Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot,

52
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,071
"I bet we could get her
to come home with us."

53
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:56,226
Or, "How much
does your mom weigh?

54
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:58,306
"I want to know what I'm getting into."

55
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:01,892
- I didn't say anything like that.
- Good, 'cause they don't work.

56
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:05,583
They also don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

57
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:07,662
Sadly, that's my home run swing.

58
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,531
Look, everything went fine.

59
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:14,498
I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.

60
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,450
That woman across the hall is into me.

61
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,660
Let's go to the tape.

62
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:24,086
Look at her reaction
to the good night kiss.

63
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:27,126
No change in respiration,
pupils un-dilated,

64
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:30,317
- no flushing of the chest.
- Nice close-up, by the way.

65
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,928
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched:
no tongue access.

66
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:36,605
Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.

67
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:39,680
That's not a bad sign.

68
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:43,434
Please, you might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

69
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:47,026
And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.

70
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:50,115
I'm not there
because I'm taking things slow,

71
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:54,153
which, by the way, compared to you guys,
approaches warp speed.

72
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,832
And take down that camera.

73
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:02,435
He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.

74
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:06,858
Give him time.

75
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:11,339
Episode 201: The Bad Fish Paradigm

76
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:14,157
Synch: Sixe, Jesslataree

00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:27,436
seriessub.com / sub-way.fr / forom.com

78
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,884
Hi.

79
00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:50,137
Oh, hi, Penny.

80
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:54,239
FYI, the hot water is inadequate
on machine two, so colors only,

81
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:57,216
and four is still releasing the fabric
softener too early in the cycle,

82
00:04:57,378 --> 00:05:00,105
- so avoid using it for your delicates.
- Thanks.

83
00:05:03,618 --> 00:05:05,807
Good Lord...
why don't you just take your clothes

84
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:08,461
down to the river
and beat them with a rock?

85
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:16,476
Can I ask you a question?

86
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:20,073
I would prefer that you not,
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

87
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:22,909
All right, I heard yes, so...

88
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:25,370
Here's my question.

89
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:27,773
Has Leonard ever dated,

90
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:30,270
you know, a regular girl?

91
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:35,017
I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.

92
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,634
Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.

93
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:43,375
No, I meant, has he ever been involved
with someone

94
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:45,038
who wasn't a brainiac?

95
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,021
A few years ago,
he did go out with a woman

96
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,261
who had a PhD
in French literature.

97
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:54,566
How is that not a brainiac?

98
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:57,444
Well, for one thing, she was French.

99
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,465
For another,
it was literature.

100
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:09,185
So...

101
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:13,060
Do you think that if
Leonard and I keep dating,

102
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,317
he'll eventually
get bored with me?

103
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,636
- That depends.
- On what?

104
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,723
Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?

105
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:29,818
Do you speak Klingon?

106
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:35,353
- You know any card tricks?
- Okay, you know what...

107
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,925
I get it.
Leonard has no business being involved

108
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:42,734
with a waitress-slash-actress
who felt so insecure

109
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:45,867
that she lied to him
about finishing community college.

110
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:47,577
Why would you lie about that?

111
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:50,852
He was going on and on
about this college and that grad school,

112
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:54,089
I didn't want him to think
I was some kind of stupid loser.

113
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:56,338
You thought the opposite
of "stupid loser"

114
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,505
was "community college graduate"?

115
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,104
You know, there are a lot
of successful people in this country

116
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:07,931
who are community college graduates.

117
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,904
Yeah, but you are neither.

118
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:13,190
Right.

119
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,067
Okay, this is between you and me.
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

120
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:20,693
You're asking me to keep a secret?

121
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:23,459
Well, I'm sorry,

122
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,603
but you would have had to express
that desire before revealing the secret,

123
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:30,161
so I could've chosen if I wanted to
accept the covenant of secret keeping.

124
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,458
You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.

125
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,127
What?

126
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:40,379
Secret keeping
is a complicated endeavor.

127
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,884
One has to be concerned
not only about what one says,

128
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,593
but about facial expressions,
autonomic reflexes.

129
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:49,224
When I try to deceive,
I myself have more nervous tics

130
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,767
than a Lyme disease research facility.

131
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:58,724
It's a joke.

132
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,680
It relies on the homonymic relationship

133
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,726
between "tick,"
the bloodsucking arachnid,

134
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:05,601
and "tic,"
the involuntary muscular contraction.

135
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:11,259
I made it up myself.

136
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:16,293
Okay, look, if Leonard
finds out that I lied,

137
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,894
I will absolutely die
of embarrassment.

138
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:21,921
- Physiologically impossible.
- Sheldon, please.

139
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:24,090
Look, I am asking you as a friend.

140
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:27,894
So you're saying that friendship
contains within it

141
00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:30,555
an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?

142
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,723
Yeah.

143
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:33,441
Interesting.

144
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,103
One more question, and perhaps
I should have led with this.

145
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:39,149
When did we become friends?

146
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:43,847
... i.e., I couldn't
become Green Lantern

147
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:45,932
unless I was chosen
by the Guardians of Oa,

148
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:49,033
but given enough start-up capital
and an adequate research facility,

149
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,612
I could be Batman.

150
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,372
You could be Batman?

151
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:58,554
Sure.
I'm Batman. See?

152
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:03,773
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

153
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:09,210
If you're free Friday night,
I thought maybe we could go see a movie.

154
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,055
Oh, you know, I think I have
the dinner shift on Friday.

155
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:13,815
What about Saturday?

156
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:17,065
I'm not sure; the manager
hasn't posted the schedule yet.

157
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:19,150
- How about I let you know?
- Great.

158
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:21,689
So you just let me know
when you know.

159
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:24,121
Okay, so...
Oh, God, I am the bad fish.

160
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:28,112
What did I do wrong?

161
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:29,906
Why are you asking me?

162
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:32,537
I have no information
about your interactions with Penny

163
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:34,338
other than what you have provided me,

164
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,869
nor do I have any method
of learning such things.

165
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:41,042
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

166
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:43,737
You seem to be implying
an informational back-channel

167
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:46,049
between me and Penny
where obviously none exists.

168
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,298
No, I didn't.

169
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,867
I just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things, sir.

170
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:56,672
- What's going on with you?
- I might ask you the same question.

171
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,544
Why are you attempting to drag me

172
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,645
into matters which have nothing
to do with me,

173
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:04,223
but exist between you and Penny,
a person to whom I barely speak?

174
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,431
What's wrong with your face?

175
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:17,962
There's no reason
to bring my looks into this.

176
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:20,894
Good day, Leonard.

177
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:23,259
- What?
- I said, "Good day."

178
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:28,291
"Good day"?

179
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:33,098
Also today, we have
a fresh-caught Alaska salmon,

180
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:35,666
and that's served
with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice.

181
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:38,391
- Our soup of the day is...
- You must release me from my oath.

182
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:43,532
Sheldon, I'm working.

183
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:47,139
- Why don't you take a minute to decide?
- Oh, my...

184
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:49,932
I can't keep your secret.

185
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:52,382
I'm going to fold
like an energy-based de novo protein

186
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:54,117
in conformational space.

187
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:57,337
Like a Renaissance tryptich.

188
00:10:57,904 --> 00:10:59,107
Like a cheap suit.

189
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,166
Look, why is it so hard for you
to keep one little secret?

190
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:06,420
I'm constitutionally incapable.
That's why I was refused clearance

191
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,765
for a prestigious
government research fellowship

192
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,522
at a secret military supercollider

193
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,580
located beneath a fake
agricultural station

194
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,455
12.5 miles southeast
of Traverse City, Michigan.

195
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:22,700
Which you did not hear about
from me.

196
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,763
Just forget I told you about me...

197
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:30,234
- not graduating from community college.
- Forget?

198
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:32,952
You want me to forget?
This mind does not forget.

199
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,060
I haven't forgotten a single thing

200
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,101
since my mother stopped
breastfeeding me.

201
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:40,954
- It was a drizzly Tuesday.
- Okay...

202
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:43,754
You promised me
you would keep my secret,

203
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:45,792
so just figure out a way to do it.

204
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:49,389
Leonard, I'm moving out.

205
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,010
What do you mean, you're moving out?
Why?

206
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:57,181
There doesn't have to be a reason.

207
00:11:59,058 --> 00:12:00,684
Yeah, there kinda does.

208
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,124
Not necessarily.

209
00:12:02,244 --> 00:12:04,893
This is a classic example
of Munchausen's Trilemma.

210
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:07,475
Either the reason is predicated
on a series of sub-reasons

211
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:09,205
leading to an infinite regression,

212
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:11,549
or it tracks back to arbitrary
axiomatic statements,

213
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,077
or it's ultimately circular,

214
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:15,574
i.e. I'm moving out
because I'm moving out.

215
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:19,408
I'm still confused.

216
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:22,305
Leonard, I don't see
how I could have made it any simpler.

217
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,436
Hey, <i>qu'est-ce que s'up</i>?

218
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,274
We just got back from that exhibit
of those plasticized human cadavers.

219
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:32,866
And some of those skinless chicks
were hot!

220
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:37,108
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to pack.

221
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:41,987
That's kind of an overreaction
to a little harmless necrophilia.

222
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:47,187
It's not you, Howard.
He says he's moving out.

223
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:49,037
What did you do?

224
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:52,817
Did you change the contrast
or brightness settings on the TV?

225
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:56,367
Did you take a Band-Aid off
in front of him?

226
00:12:57,816 --> 00:13:00,183
Did you buy generic ketchup,
forget to rinse the sink,

227
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:02,327
talk to him
through the bathroom door?

228
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:05,630
Adjust the thermostat,
cook with cilantro,

229
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,229
pronounce the "t" in often?

230
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:13,084
Did you make fun of trains?

231
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:18,925
No, I didn't do anything.
He's just gone insane.

232
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:21,012
We all knew this day was coming.

233
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:24,368
That was fast.

234
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:27,619
It's my pre-packed disaster
evacuation bag.

235
00:13:29,097 --> 00:13:31,905
It's recommended by the Department
of Homeland Security.

236
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:33,675
And Sarah Connor.

237
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:36,934
Where are you going to live?

238
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:40,073
Until I find a permanent place,
I will stay with friends.

239
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:41,323
Bye.

240
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,447
You can't stay with me.
I have a teeny-tiny apartment.

241
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,626
Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests
an aspect of <i>manushya yajna</i>,

242
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:56,768
one of the five central religious duties
or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?

243
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,470
I hate trains.

244
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:11,146
Don't be ridiculous,
you love trains.

245
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:13,898
Yes, I do. Come on.

246
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:18,207
See you later, Leonard.

247
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,295
This could work.

248
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:38,338
This is a very old building.

249
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,948
60 years.
It used to be a watch factory.

250
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:43,344
What?

251
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:45,569
Don't you worry
about the residual radium

252
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:47,246
from the luminous dials?

253
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:49,303
Not until now!

254
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:53,818
I can't believe I didn't bring
my Geiger counter.

255
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,849
I had it on my bed
and I didn't pack it.

256
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,570
- If you're not comfortable staying...
- I'm kidding, I packed it.

257
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:03,410
It was a joke.

258
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,201
I was subverting
the conversational expectations.

259
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,412
I believe they call that
the... ol' switcheroo.

260
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:12,461
Terrific.

261
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:18,532
Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?

262
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,414
Yes, isn't she an amazing actress?

263
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:22,967
Actually, I'd say
she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.

264
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,807
How dare you!

265
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:28,388
Aishwarya Rai is a goddess.

266
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:32,310
By comparison,
Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.

267
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:36,314
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

268
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,194
Obviously, you're not that familiar
with Indian cinema.

269
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:51,189
Who is it?

270
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:52,889
Strip-o-Gram!

271
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:58,646
Tag, you're it.

272
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,744
Shouldn't you put him
in a brown paper bag

273
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:04,298
and set him on fire?!

274
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:09,778
I've never slept
on an air mattress before.

275
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:12,731
No lumbar support whatsoever.

276
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:17,509
Maybe you'd be happier
on a park bench.

277
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:21,442
I don't see any way
to get a park bench in here.

278
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:25,042
- Do you want to switch?
- No, that's fine.

279
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:27,995
I'm perfectly comfortable
sleeping on a bouncy castle.

280
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:33,621
- Get out of bed. We're switching.
- Only if you want to.

281
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:35,075
Just get in the bed!

282
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,577
<i>What's going on?</i>

283
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,074
<i>Are you boys roughhousing?</i>

284
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,798
We're just talking, Ma!

285
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:46,258
<i>If you don't settle down right now,</i>

286
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:50,424
<i>I'm not going to let you
have any more sleepovers!</i>

287
00:16:51,348 --> 00:16:54,404
For God's sake, Ma,
I'm 27 years old!

288
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:57,437
And it's not even a school night!

289
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:03,318
Comfy now?

290
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:12,264
That poster of Halle Berry
is a little unnerving.

291
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:15,746
So don't look at it.

292
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,079
She's like
my fourth favorite Catwoman.

293
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,125
No kidding.

294
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:22,337
Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer,
Eartha Kitt, and then her.

295
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:24,338
What about Lee Merriweather?

296
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,474
I forgot about Lee Merriweather.

297
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:28,882
I'm glad that's settled.

298
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,837
That makes Halle Berry
my fifth favorite Catwoman.

299
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:34,965
It's Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer,

300
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:38,728
- Eartha Kitt, Lee Merriweather...
- Please, I'm begging you. Go to sleep.

301
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:41,345
I'm trying. I'm counting Catwomen.

302
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:48,821
She did make a fine mutant
in the X-Men movies, though.

303
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:51,301
- For God's sake.
- She's not my favorite of the X-Men.

304
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:53,425
In order that would be:
Wolverine, Cyclops...

305
00:17:53,545 --> 00:17:54,743
I forgot Professor X.

306
00:17:54,946 --> 00:17:56,870
Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops,

307
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:59,309
Iceman, then Storm,
Angel, the Beast--

308
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:00,792
No, wait, Nightcrawler.

309
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:05,004
Professor X, Nightcrawler,
Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, Storm,

310
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:06,207
Angel...

311
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:08,224
I'm coming!

312
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,554
There he is.

313
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:15,890
There my old buddy bud bud.

314
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:23,102
What's with him?

315
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:25,719
Koothrappali dumped him on me,
and he couldn't get to sleep,

316
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,452
so I gave him a glass of warm milk

317
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:30,005
with a handful
of my mom's Valium in it...

318
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,423
but he still wouldn't shut up,
so tag, you're it.

319
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:40,526
I'm ba-ack.

320
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,461
- I still don't know why you left.
- I can't tell you.

321
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:46,663
Why not?

322
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:48,283
I promised Penny.

323
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,593
You promised Penny what?

324
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,643
I wouldn't tell you the secret.

325
00:18:58,176 --> 00:19:00,576
What secret?
Tell me the secret.

326
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:06,283
Mom smokes in the car.

327
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:11,863
Jesus is okay with it
but we can't tell Dad.

328
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:17,116
Not that secret. The other secret.

329
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:19,102
- I'm Batman!
- Damn it! Sheldon!

330
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,336
You said Penny told you a secret.
What's the secret?

331
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:29,063
Okay, I'll tell you,

332
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:30,744
but you can't tell Leonard.

333
00:19:32,483 --> 00:19:33,620
I promise.

334
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:37,328
Penny lied about graduating
from community college

335
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:40,389
'cause she's afraid
she's not smart enough for Leonard.

336
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:47,440
So it's nothing I did?
It's her problem?

337
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:50,351
I drank milk that tasted funny.

338
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:58,159
Penny thinks I'm too smart for her.
That's ridiculous.

339
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,319
I know.

340
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:03,590
Most of your work
is extremely derivative.

341
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:06,810
And don't worry,
that's not a secret.

342
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:08,953
Everybody knows.

343
00:20:36,627 --> 00:20:37,876
Hi. Yeah, hi.

344
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:41,035
I know what's been bothering you
about us, and I have the answer.

345
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,579
What are you talking about?

346
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,867
First, I wanna say
that it's not Sheldon's fault.

347
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:46,749
He tried very hard to keep your secret.

348
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:49,965
If Howard hadn't drugged him,
he would've taken it to his grave.

349
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:53,259
- He told you?
- Yes, but it's okay.

350
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,176
Now that we know what the problem is
there's a simple solution.

351
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,511
Pasadena City College?

352
00:20:59,898 --> 00:21:02,316
"A place for fun,
a place for knowledge."

353
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:09,805
This man here is playing hackey-sack,
and this girl's gonna be a paralegal.

354
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:12,862
Oh, I get it.

355
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:14,610
Because Dr. Leonard Hofstadter

356
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,529
can't date a girl
without a fancy college degree.

357
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:21,242
It's really not that fancy.
It's just a city college.

358
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:25,080
Right, but I have to have some
sort of degree to date you?

359
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,792
That doesn't matter to me at all.

360
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:29,708
So it's fine with you
if I'm not smart.

361
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:30,994
Absolutely.

362
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,622
Okay, this time,
I know where I went wrong.

363
00:21:41,763 --> 00:21:42,769
Bite me!
