1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,130
Oh, boy.

2
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:07,132
What?

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,133
I can't comment without violating
our agreement

4
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:11,134
that I don't criticize your work.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,860
Then what was "Oh, boy"?

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,160
Great restraint on my part.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,760
There's nothing wrong
with the science here.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,200
Perhaps you mean a different
thing than I do

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,530
when you say, "Science."

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,600
Okay, how's that?

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,360
You actually had it right
in the first place

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,800
Once again, you've fallen

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,160
for one of my classic pranks.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,300
Bazinga!

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,060
Now here's a
peculiar e-mail.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,430
The president of the
university wants
me to meet him

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,560
at his office tomorrow
morning at 8:00 a.m.

18
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,560
Why?
It doesn't say.

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,400
It must be an emergency.

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,100
Everyone at the university knows
I eat breakfast at 8:00

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,660
and move my bowels at 8:20.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,860
Yes, how did we live
before Twitter?

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,330
I guess you'll find out
what it is in the morning.

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,160
That's 14 hours away.

25
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,560
For the next 840 minutes,

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm effectively one
of Heisenberg's particles;

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,500
I know where I am or I know
how fast I'm going,

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,660
but I can't know both.

29
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,400
Yet how am I supposed
to carry on

30
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,430
with this huge annoying thing
hovering over my head?

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,330
Yeah, I know the feeling.

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,760
* Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state *

33
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,300
* Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! *

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,860
* The Earth began to cool

35
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,560
* The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools *

36
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,730
<i>* We built the Wall
* We built the pyramids *</i>

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,700
* Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery *

38
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,630
* That all started
with a big bang *

39
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,430
Leonard? Leonard?

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,200
Leonard?

41
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,300
(sighs)

42
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,030
Sheldon, it's 2:00
in the morning.

43
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,600
Why is everybody keep telling me
what time it is?

44
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,700
Everybody?

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,900
You, the president

46
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,730
of the university, his wife,

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,560
their sullen teenage daughter.

48
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,430
That entire family is fascinated
by what time it is

49
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,030
and whether people know it.

50
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,700
You went to President Seibert's
house

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,300
in the middle of the night?

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,130
He didn't respond
to my e-mail,

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,360
his phone number
is unlisted.

54
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,000
Tell me what my
other option was.

55
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,400
You could have waited
until morning.

56
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,060
I know, look who I'm talking to.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,700
Do you remember the grant
proposal I submitted

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,400
to the National
Science Foundation

59
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,530
to detect slow-moving monopoles

60
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,330
at the magnetic North Pole?

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,700
(tinkling)

62
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,200
Hardly a day goes by
when I don't think about it.

63
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,900
Aw, how nice.

64
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,200
Well, a space opened up

65
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,900
at the last minute on the NSF
expedition to the Arctic Circle.

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,600
Wait a minute.
(toilet flushes)

67
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,260
He offered to send you
to the North Pole?

68
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,430
Yes.

69
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,560
In fact, he was quite
enthusiastic.

70
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,860
He said, "Frankly,

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,530
if I could send you tonight,
I would."

72
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,830
Okay, well, do you
want to go?

73
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Of course not.

74
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,330
I'm a theoretical physicist.

75
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,630
A career I chose in no small
part because it's indoors,

76
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,300
but if I'm able to detect

77
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,560
slow-moving magnetic
monopoles there,

78
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,330
I will be the scientis
to confirm string theory.

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
People will write
books about me.

80
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,860
Third-graders will create
macaroni-art dioramas

81
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,860
depicting scenes
from my life.

82
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,530
Sure, maybe a tableau of me
trying to pummel you to death.

83
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,200
Sarcasm?

84
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,900
Maybe.

85
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,100
I'm on the horns of a dilemma.

86
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,030
Can you imagine me, Sheldon
Cooper, at the North Pole?

87
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,130
Easy peasy, I'm doing it
right now.

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,360
I'm not good
with cold, Leonard.

89
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,500
How often have we had
to leave a movie theater

90
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,660
because I got a headache

91
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,360
from drinking
the Icee too fast?

92
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,460
I can't go.

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,660
Well, then don't go.

94
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,130
How can you say that?

95
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,260
The scientific opportunity
of a lifetime

96
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,600
presents itself and my best
friend says "Don't go."

97
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,830
All right, then go.

98
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,200
Listen to you.

99
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,560
How can I possibly go?

100
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,030
Sheldon, what are the words
I can say right now

101
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,660
to end this conversation
and let me go back to sleep?

102
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:22,730
Odd, President Seibert posed
the exact same question.

103
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,730
How was it resolved?

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,600
It wasn't.
His wife set their dogs on me

105
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,430
and rendered the question moot.

106
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,560
Just imagine.
If he says yes,

107
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,000
we'll have an entire
summer without Sheldon.

108
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,560
We could play outside.

109
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,330
We could sit on the left side

110
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,330
of the couch.

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,230
I could use the bathroom
at 8:20.

112
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,860
Our dreams are very small,
aren't they?

113
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,360
Good news, gentlemen,
I have tentatively accepted...

114
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,930
ALL:
Yeah!

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Whoo-hoo!

116
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,460
...the invitation to join
the Arctic Expedition.

117
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,000
It's not gonna be
the same without you.
Godspeed.

118
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,100
Thank you,

119
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,160
but your sentiments
may be premature.

120
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,760
Ooh, I don't like
where this is going.

121
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,630
I would like to propose...

122
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,300
that the three of
you accompany me.

123
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,660
To the North Pole?

124
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,960
Yes.

125
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,960
Is this just so
we won't touch your stuff

126
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,300
while you're away?

127
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll admit that
was a concern.

128
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,130
But the fact is,

129
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
I'll need a support team.

130
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,060
And the three of you

131
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,130
are my first choice.

132
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,460
Really?

133
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,400
Well, there are others
who might be more qualified,

134
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,660
but the thought of interviewing
them gave me a stomachache.

135
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,400
Now, I know I'm proposing
an enormous undertaking,

136
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,200
so why don't you take a few
moments to discuss it?

137
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,300
We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole

138
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,500
with him, are we?

139
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,660
SHELDON:
I'm still within earshot!

140
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,260
You may want to wait
for my door to close.

141
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,800
(door closes)

142
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,030
We're not really gonna go

143
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,030
to the North Pole
with him, are we?

144
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,700
Hang on. Let's talk about it.

145
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,230
This is a National Science
Foundation expedition.

146
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,260
I don't know how
we can turn it down.

147
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,360
Easy. Instead of saying,
"No, we don't want to go
on an NSF expedition,"

148
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,600
say, "No, we don't
want to spend

149
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,360
"three months stuck in a
cabin in the Arctic Circle

150
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,500
with an anal nutbag."

151
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,060
But if we were part of the team
that confirmed string theory,

152
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,360
we could drink for free in
any bar in any college town

153
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,360
with a university that has
a strong science program.

154
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,760
Howard, this is big science.

155
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,800
You could be the engineer
who builds the equipment

156
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,660
that puts us on the cover
of magazines.

157
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,860
I could also be the engineer

158
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,930
who builds the crossbow
that kills Sheldon.

159
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,700
You still might
get on a magazine.

160
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,030
So you guys are seriously
considering this?

161
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,630
Yes.
And you think you can
put up with Sheldon?

162
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,530
Well, I'm a Hindu.

163
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,260
My religion teaches that
if we suffer in this life

164
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,960
we are rewarded in the next.

165
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,200
Three months at the
North Pole with Sheldon,

166
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,030
and I'm reborn as a well-hung
billionaire with wings!

167
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,260
Well, gentlemen, have you
reached a decision?

168
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm in.

169
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,430
Me, too.

170
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,400
Oh, damn it.
Peer pressure. Fine.

171
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,160
Excellent.

172
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,330
Just an FYI,

173
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,030
as I am the expedition's
team leader,

174
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,060
protocol dictates that
be phrased, "Fine, sir."

175
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,930
But don't worry,

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,100
there will be a briefing.

177
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,430
(imitates gunshot)

178
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,730
Penny.

179
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,830
(knocking)
Sheldon.

180
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,660
Penny.

181
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
(knocking)
Sheldon.

182
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,760
Penny.

183
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,760
(knocking)
Sheldon.

184
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,760
Penny.

185
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,760
(knocking)
Sheldon.

186
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,760
Penny!

187
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,760
(knocking)
Sheldon!

188
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,760
Penny!

189
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,200
What do you want?

190
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,000
I need access to the Cheesecake
Factory's walk-in freezer.

191
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,460
Now, honey, I already told you,
the hamburger meat is fresh and
stored at a safe temperature.

192
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,130
No. This is to train for a
three-month expedition to
the magnetic North Pole.

193
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,300
What?

194
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,400
I don't know how that sentence

195
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,500
could possibly confuse you...

196
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,000
but to elaborate, I'm
going to the Arctic Circle

197
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,860
with Leonard, Wolowitz
and Koothrappali.

198
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,060
You're all going?

199
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,700
Yes.
For three months?

200
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,400
Yes.

201
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,860
Excuse me.

202
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,300
Is that a yes or
a no on the freezer?

203
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,530
The woman has the
attention span of a gnat.

204
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,330
PENNY:
Hey, Leonard.
Hey.

205
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Sheldon says you're going
to the North Pole.

206
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,930
Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah. I'm just a little
surprised you didn't tell me.

208
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,200
Oh, well, it all happened
kind of fast.

209
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,900
And we had to get physicals
and buy thermal underwear

210
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,900
and study up on, you know,
snow and stuff.

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,930
Sorry, I was gonna tell you.

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,930
Oh, hey, no, you don't
have to apologize.

213
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,660
There's no reason
you have to tell me.

214
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,400
I was just...
you know, surprised.

215
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,830
Yes, yes, you were busy,

216
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,100
you were surprised,
all very fascinating.

217
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,900
Now where do we stand
on the freezer?

218
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,200
Is he serious?

219
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,060
Actually, it would help.

220
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,830
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

221
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,360
So, three months
at the North Pole.

222
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,960
Wow, that is...

223
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,700
awesome.

224
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,830
Yeah.

225
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,130
I'm sorry, but at what
point do you put this

226
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,000
"see what you can do"
plan into action?

227
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,730
Just a warning, Sheldon--

228
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,530
The freezer locks
from the outside.

229
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,730
Did she seem upset to you?
No.

230
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:57,731
Did she seem upset to you?
No.

231
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,630
Oh, good, I got it right.

232
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,930
Are you upset?

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,260
A little bit.

234
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,430
Two for two.
I'm on fire.

235
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,960
I mean, I know she's not
my girlfriend or anything,

236
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,000
but wouldn't you think
she'd feel a little bad

237
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,100
that I'm going to be gone
for the whole summer?

238
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,100
That feels like
a bonus question.

239
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,760
I'm going to stop here
while I'm ahead,

240
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:22,761
but I had a great time.

242
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,060
is to acclimate us
to the use of tools

243
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,330
in extreme temperatures

244
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,330
such as we will face
in the Arctic Circle.

245
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,930
Where are your tools?

246
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Right here.

247
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,030
All right, team, open
up your practice kits.

248
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,860
As the university
did not permit me

249
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,500
to bring the actual
equipment we'll be using

250
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,960
to the Cheesecake Factory,
because apparently,

251
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,200
I'm "ridiculous,"

252
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,060
I've provided substitutes

253
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,960
which will exercise
your fine motor skills.

254
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,300
Leonard, you will
be doing a series

255
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,300
of complex mathematical problems

256
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,800
on a vintage Casio model

257
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,130
1175 calculator
watch I received

258
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,660
when I won the Earth Science
medal in 3rd grade.

259
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,300
Treat it with respect.

260
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,730
Raj, you will be painting

261
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,460
sideburns and a Van Dyke

262
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,360
on a six-inch figurine
of Legolas the elf.

263
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,730
Now, remember,

264
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,700
a Van Dyke is a goatee
without a mustache.

265
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,130
Wolowitz, you will be completing

266
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,530
a series of delicate
surgical procedures

267
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,260
on the classic children's
game "Operation."

268
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,730
To begin with, you will

269
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,660
"remove funny bone for
two hundred dollars."

270
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,100
For this I went to MIT.

271
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,430
And begin.

272
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,460
(groaning)

273
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,460
I think I swallowed some paint!

274
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,100
I can't press any of the
buttons with my gloves.

275
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,560
Oh, son of a bitch!

276
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,160
Adversity is to be expected.

277
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,360
Continue.

278
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,860
(game buzzing)
Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.

279
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,900
Okay, I can't do this.

280
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,030
Me either.

281
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,700
Gentlemen, use your imagination.

282
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,860
Innovate.

283
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,500
Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker

284
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,400
freeze to death on the
ice planet of Hoth?

285
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,700
No.

286
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,600
He cut open a tauntaun

287
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,900
and used its internal
body heat to warm him up.

288
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,430
You heard the man.

289
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,060
Hold him down
and I'll cut him open.

290
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,660
Hang on, I know I don't possess
the tools of leadership,

291
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,800
but I don't understand why we
can't assemble the equipment

292
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,700
inside the hut and
then take it outside.

293
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,930
I hadn't thought of that.

294
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,100
I guess we're done here.

295
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,250
Here, drink slash eat this.

296
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,750
What is it?

297
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,010
Hot chocolate
with a stick of butter.

298
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,480
Okay, why?

299
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,550
Because in the frigid
temperatures in the Arctic,

300
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,750
we need to consume at least
5,000 calories a day

301
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,350
just to maintain
our body weight.

302
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,010
Sheldon, you know
I can't eat butter.

303
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,180
I'm lactose intolerant.

304
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,550
Way ahead of you, that's an

305
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,050
"I Can't Believe
It's Not Butter" stick.

306
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,910
But all the other guys
are going to the North Pole.

307
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,250
I don't care what the
other guys are doing.

308
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,810
If the other guys jumped
in the Bay of Bengal

309
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,750
and tried to swim to Sri Lanka,

310
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,150
would you follow them?

311
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,310
If you were standing
behind me nagging, I might.

312
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,180
Don't talk back
to your mother.

313
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,780
This trip is much too
dangerous, Rajesh.

314
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,250
No, it's not.

315
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,380
Howard, tell them.

316
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,110
<i>Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali,
namaste.</i>

317
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,550
I understand your concern,

318
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,180
but if it'll make
you feel any better,

319
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,610
my mother is fine with me going,

320
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
and this is a woman
who kept a safety rail

321
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,850
on my bed until I was 17.

322
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,210
So, she has no problem

323
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,750
with her son being
eaten by a walrus?

324
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,580
That's very unlikely,
Mrs. Koothrappali.

325
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,910
If Raj dies,

326
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,880
it'll be from frostbite,
gangrene, acute sunburn

327
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,880
or being ripped to shreds
by a 1,500 pound polar bear.

328
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,550
Ma, I'm putting you
on speakerphone

329
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,250
with Raj's parents.

330
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,750
Can you tell them
that you're okay

331
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,980
with me going to the Arctic?

332
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,210
Arctic?!

333
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,080
I thought you said Arkansas!

334
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,750
I didn't say that.

335
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,150
You never listen to me!

336
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,250
He doesn't tell me anything!

337
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,450
He lives a secret life
because he's ashamed!

338
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,850
Hey, Leonard, can I talk
to you for a sec?

339
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,710
Sure, but let's
go out here
(Wolowitz's mom ranting)

340
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,680
where there's a little
less yelling and guilt.

341
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,510
What's up?

342
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,010
Well, I got you a little
going away present.

343
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,850
Oh, a blanket.

344
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,380
Oh, no, no, no,
not just a blanket.

345
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,310
See, it has sleeves.

346
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,910
Yeah!

347
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,450
So, you can, you know,
be all snoodled up

348
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,810
while you do
your science stuff.

349
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,750
Oh, wow, cool.

350
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,180
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

351
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,910
See you later.
Bye.

352
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,150
MRS. KOOTHRAPALI:
I told you no!

353
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,610
Why don't you believe me?

354
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,510
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
'Cause it doesn't
make sense to me!

355
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,580
How can it be that
in the entire country
of India,

356
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,150
there isn't one
Outback Steakhouse?!

357
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,210
(knocking on door)

358
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,450
Sheldon... Sheldon?

359
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,850
I want a cookie, Meemaw.

360
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,580
Sheldon, it's me.

361
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,150
But Meemaw just made cookies.

362
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,180
Listen, I don't know if
I can go on the expedition.

363
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,680
What?

364
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,480
I don't think I can
go to the North Pole.

365
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,310
Okay, Leonard,

366
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,350
I know you're concerned
about disappointing me

367
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,980
but I want you to take
comfort from the knowledge

368
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,480
that my expectations
of you are very low.

369
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,510
Yeah, that's very comforting.

370
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,410
Comforting is a part
of leadership.

371
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,610
It's not a part I care for,
but such is my burden.

372
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,780
Terrific, it's just that

373
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,480
I don't think Penny
wants me to go.

374
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,780
Assuming that's a valid reason
not to go, which it isn't,

375
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,480
how do you know this?

376
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,010
Did she say it?

377
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,180
Not exactly.

378
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,210
But she said she was gonna
miss me and she gave me this.

379
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,580
What is it?

380
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,980
It's a blanket with sleeves.

381
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,110
Oh, that's clever.

382
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,810
Let me see if I understand
this correctly.

383
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,910
Her missing you
is an emotional state

384
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,150
you find desirable?

385
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,480
Yes, obviously.
All right.

386
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,380
Well, given that missing you
is predicated on you leaving,

387
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,980
logic dictates you must leave.

388
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,310
Yes, okay, but I'm gonna
be gone for three months.

389
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,410
What if she doesn't miss me that
long and she meets someone else?

390
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,450
She does have a short
attention span.

391
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,710
So, I can't go.

392
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,980
Leonard, you may be right.

393
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,850
It appears that Penny
secretly wants you

394
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,050
in her life in a very
intimate and carnal fashion.

395
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,210
You really think so?

396
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,980
Of course not.

397
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,510
Even in my sleep-deprived
state, I've managed to

398
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,780
pull off another one
of my classic pranks.

399
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,180
Bazinga!

400
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,510
Oh, Leonard, what time is it?

401
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,250
It's 7:00 a.m.
I'm sorry it's early,

402
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,510
but we're leaving soon,
and I needed to talk to you.

403
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,080
Okay.

404
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,750
What did you mean when you
said you're going to miss me?

405
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,910
Um, I don't know.

406
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,480
You'll be gone and I'll notice.

407
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,450
Okay, well, um, what about this?

408
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,850
What does this mean?

409
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,010
Wine, credit card
and late night television

410
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,480
are a bad combination.

411
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,180
All right, fine.

412
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,150
What about that really long hug?

413
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,310
What did that mean?

414
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,810
That wasn't a long hug.

415
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,910
It was at least
five Mississippis.

416
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,450
A standard hug is
two Mississippis tops.

417
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,480
Leonard, I don't know
what to tell you.

418
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,880
It was just a hug.

419
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,050
Glad we cleared that up.

420
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,610
Yeah.

421
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,480
I guess I'll see you.

422
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,710
Okay, have a safe trip.

423
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,750
Thank you. Bye.

424
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,880
Okay, bye.

425
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,450
(sighs)

426
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:49,451
Means I wish you weren't going.

427
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,250
Damn it.

428
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,380
What?

429
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,510
We're out of ice.

430
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,780
All right, men,
we begin initial assembly

431
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,450
and deployment of
the testing equipment

432
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,010
starting tomorrow at 0700 hours,

433
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,580
but until then,
you are all off duty.

434
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,910
I suggest you keep

435
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,710
the shenanigans to a minimum

436
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,050
as medical help is
18 hours away by dogsled.

437
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,010
What are you working on?

438
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,080
Crossbow.

439
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,350
Hey, guys, can I
just say something?

440
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,880
How about we take a
moment to think about

441
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,350
where we are right now?

442
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,710
This is literally

443
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,550
the top of the world.

444
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,080
Only a handful of people
in all of human history

445
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,210
will ever see what
we are going to see.

446
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,150
He's right.

447
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,410
Yeah, wow.

448
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,080
It is remarkable.

449
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,680
So, who's up for a movie?

450
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,080
Good idea, what do you think?

451
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,580
Ice Station Zebra or
John Carpenter's The Thing?

452
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,780
I say double feature.

453
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,550
Dinner's ready!

454
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,280
What are we having?

455
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,850
Reconstituted Thai food.

456
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,680
Did you bring the
dehydrated low-sodium

457
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,250
soy sauce?
Check.

458
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,980
Freeze-dried
spicy mustard?
Check.

459
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,780
Flash-frozen brown
rice, not white?

460
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,710
Uh, oh, sorry.

461
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,110
Not to worry.

462
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,580
(laughing):
I hid it.

463
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,780
Bazinga!

464
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,710
You're in my spot.

465
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,980
There's no time
for a crossbow.

466
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,050
Find me an icicle.

467
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:10,410
<i>SHELDON:
Three months.
This is gonna be great!</i>
