1
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,222
Good morning.

2
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:16,079
We're gonna have to stop
by Pottery Barn on the way to work.

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,438
I bought these <i>Star Wars</i> sheets, but,

4
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:20,526
they turned out to be
much too stimulating

5
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,151
to be compatible
with a good night's sleep.

6
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:27,572
I don't like the way
Darth Vader stares at me.

7
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:30,254
I'm not going to work.

8
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:33,031
Just because your career's
been stagnant for a few years,

9
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:34,916
that's no reason to give up.

10
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:38,782
I was up all night
using the new free-electron laser

11
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:40,960
for my X-ray
diffraction experiment.

12
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:43,963
Did the laser accidentally
burn out your retinas?

13
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:45,090
No.

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,031
Then you can drive. Let's go.

15
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:51,638
Ddn't I tell you
I'd be working nights and that

16
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:53,416
you'd have to make
other arrangements?

17
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:54,849
- You did.
- And?

18
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:56,242
I didn't.

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,850
Let's go.

20
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:01,428
Good night.

21
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:04,025
- But how am I going to get to work?
- Take the bus.

22
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:06,668
I can't take the bus anymore.
They don't have seat belts,

23
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:10,115
and they won't let you latch yourself
to the seat with bungee cords.

24
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:13,650
You tried to latch yourself
to the seat with bungee cords?

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,379
I didn't try. I succeeded.

26
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:19,080
But for some reason,
it alarmed the other passengers

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,771
and I was asked to de-bus.

28
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:23,725
You're a big boy.
You'll figure it out.

29
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,066
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

30
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,982
Now, take me to return
my Star Wars sheets!

31
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,642
What is it?

32
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:39,270
Leonard's asleep.

33
00:01:41,953 --> 00:01:43,166
Thanks for the update.

34
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,566
No. Wait.

35
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,068
You have to drive me to work.

36
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:49,675
Yeah, I really don't think I do.

37
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:53,199
But I don't drive,
and I can't take the bus.

38
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,119
You'll be fine as long as you don't do
that bungee cord thing, okay?

39
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,666
Didn't you recently state
that you and I are friends?

40
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,739
Yes, Sheldon. We are friends.

41
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:08,577
Then I hereby invoke
what I'm given to understand

42
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:11,862
is an integral part
of the implied covenant of friendship.

43
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,110
The favor.

44
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:20,247
Oh, dear God.

45
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:24,846
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was interrupting your morning prayers.

46
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:28,186
When you're done, we'll go.

47
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:51,103
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

48
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:56,355
Thank you for driving me to work.

49
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,181
You know this is my day off?

50
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,767
Oh, good.
I'm not keeping you from anything.

51
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:06,394
Your "check engine" light is on.

52
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:11,511
Typically that's an indicator
to, you know, check your engine.

53
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,635
It's fine.
It's been on for, like, a month.

54
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:17,911
Actually, that would be
all the more reason to...

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,851
you know, check your engine.

56
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:22,354
Sheldon, it's fine.

57
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:24,369
If it were fine,
the light wouldn't be on.

58
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,183
That's why the manufacturer installed
that light, to let you know it's not fine.

59
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,088
Maybe the light's broken.

60
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:34,396
Is there a "check the 'check
engine light' light"?

61
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:38,486
What?

62
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:40,736
Studies have shown
that performing tasks

63
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:44,122
such as eating, talking on a cell phone
or drinking coffee while driving

64
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,725
reduces one's reaction time

65
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,814
by the same factor
as an ounce of alcohol.

66
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,691
Do you have any alcohol?

67
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,787
- Of course not.
- Too bad.

68
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:57,103
You're going up Euclid Avenue?

69
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:00,189
Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.

70
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:02,067
Good for Leonard.

71
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:04,608
Euclid Avenue is shorter
as the crow flies,

72
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:07,186
but it has speed bumps,
which appreciably increase

73
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:09,919
point-to-point drive time,
making it the less efficient choice.

74
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:13,423
But you have the conn.

75
00:04:17,563 --> 00:04:19,792
If you're not going
to slow down for the speed bumps,

76
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:21,973
I withdraw my previous objection.

77
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:25,226
Here's a fun question.

78
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,170
Do you know what the most
common street name is?

79
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,193
- No.
- The answer's tricky.

80
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:33,078
It's Second Street.

81
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:35,816
You'd think it would be First Street,
but in most towns,

82
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:38,078
First Street eventually
gets renamed to something else.

83
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:39,912
You know,
like Main Street,

84
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:41,463
Broad Street.

85
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,153
Michigan Avenue.

86
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:45,970
Leonard and I
often use our commute time

87
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,458
to exercise our minds
with brain-teasers like that.

88
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:50,410
We also play games.

89
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,057
- Would you like to play one?
- No.

90
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,574
Come on. It's fun.

91
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:58,575
Another bump.

92
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,421
Okay. I'll say an element,
and you say an element

93
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,885
whose name starts with the last letter
of the one I said, okay?

94
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:10,146
I'll start.

95
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:12,690
Helium.

96
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,779
Now, you could say "mercury."

97
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:22,447
That would give me a "y."
Very clever. That's a tough one.

98
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:27,108
So I go with "ytterbium,"
which gets you back to "m."

99
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:31,173
So you go "molybdenum,"
and I say "magnesium."

100
00:05:31,293 --> 00:05:34,292
You say "manganese."
I say "europium,"

101
00:05:34,412 --> 00:05:36,474
and, then, you're left
with "mendelevium,"

102
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:38,214
and... there are no more m's

103
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:40,991
because I believe that meitnerium
should still be called ekairidium.

104
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:42,887
So, congratulations. You win.

105
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,751
Do you wanna go again?

106
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,022
Why don't we just have
a little quiet time now?

107
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:54,649
All right.

108
00:06:00,314 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm sorry.
I'm finding your reckless nonchalance

109
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,179
regarding the check-engine light
to be very troubling.

110
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:10,732
Get out.

111
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:15,674
I have to tell you that while I do have
a theoretical understanding

112
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:17,740
of the workings
of an internal combustion engine,

113
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,383
I'm not sure I'm capable
of performing diagnostics.

114
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,385
I said, "Get out."

115
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,303
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

116
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:42,278
There you are.
I'm ready to go home.

117
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,837
- I just got here.
- Good. Perfect timing.

118
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,730
I told you, I only have access
to the free-electron laser at night.

119
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,624
I can't drive you
for the next few weeks.

120
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:55,732
No, you said you couldn't
drive me to work.

121
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:57,145
This is from work.

122
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,236
Howard, help me out here.

123
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,283
No, just for the fun of it,
I'm gonna take his side.

124
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,804
Now,
how do you propose I get home?

125
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:09,182
How did you get here
in the first place?

126
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:10,362
Penny.

127
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:12,862
But I sense
that's no longer an option.

128
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:16,186
I need to get to the laser lab.

129
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:19,552
You're just gonna have
to find someone else to take you home.

130
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,011
Damn, I picked the wrong side.

131
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,266
God, not Euclid Avenue!

132
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:46,844
Why did Howard leave you
in the middle of the road anyway?

133
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:51,106
- We had a difference of opinion.
- Over what?

134
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:54,102
Whether or not
he was trying to kill me.

135
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,383
For the record,
I maintain he was.

136
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:00,483
Where are you going?
I'm taking you home.

137
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:03,036
But I'm not going home.
It's Wednesday.

138
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:06,786
Wednesday's new comic book day.
We have to go to the comic book store.

139
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,833
Then, we have to stop
at Souplantation;

140
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:10,597
it's creamy tomato soup day.

141
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:14,003
And Radio Shack.
There's a sale on triple-A batteries.

142
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,333
Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn
and return my Star Wars sheets.

143
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,460
I have a better idea.

144
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:22,835
You want to go
to Pottery Barn first?

145
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,474
Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?

146
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:45,731
Maybe if I turn off the night-light,
I can keep the sheets.

147
00:08:58,194 --> 00:08:59,328
Good morning.

148
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:02,281
Good morning.

149
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:04,594
Sheldon, sit down.

150
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,747
She's in my spot.

151
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,430
Don't look at me like that.
Everybody knows that's my spot.

152
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:21,519
You know that we care about you.

153
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:25,568
And it's because we care about you
that we've decided we have to speak up.

154
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,617
You're hurting the people
around you, sweetie.

155
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:36,022
So we made you an appointment,
and we want you to keep it.

156
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:41,121
Department of Motor Vehicles
New Driver Handbook?

157
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:47,040
But I don't have a problem.

158
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:51,010
Sheldon, you need
to learn how to drive.

159
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:53,129
This madness has to stop.

160
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:57,391
Penny's taking you to the DMV.
I'm going to bed.

161
00:09:57,774 --> 00:10:00,443
- Why Penny?
- Because rock breaks scissors.

162
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:01,619
Good night.

163
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:05,233
- All right, come on, Sheldon.
- Hold on.

164
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,652
- I have one condition.
- What?

165
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:09,654
We have to stop at Pottery Barn.

166
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,132
And Radio Shack.

167
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:15,284
Fine.

168
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:18,711
- And the comic book store.
- All right!

169
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,374
I want to go
to the comic book store.

170
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:42,494
I like comic books.

171
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:49,970
I still don't see
why I need a driver's license.

172
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,963
Albert Einstein never had
a driver's license.

173
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:56,347
Yeah, but Albert Einstein
didn't make me wet myself

174
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:57,883
at 40 miles an hour.

175
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:01,956
Yeah, and I never wanted to kick
Albert Einstein in the nuts.

176
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:09,721
I gotta ask, why didn't you just get
a license at 16 like everybody else?

177
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:11,789
I was otherwise engaged.

178
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,540
Doing what?

179
00:11:15,028 --> 00:11:18,596
Examing perturbative amplitudes
in N=4 supersymmetric theories

180
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:21,253
leading to a re-examination
of the ultraviolet properties

181
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:24,858
of multi-loop N=8 supergravity
using modern twistor theory.

182
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,748
Well, how about
when you were 17?

183
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:35,024
Take this to the testing area,
put your name at the top,

184
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,707
sign the bottom, answer the questions,
bring it back. Next.

185
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:44,999
Application?

186
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,115
I'm actually more of a theorist.

187
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:52,394
The application in your hand.

188
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:53,747
Give it to her.

189
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:00,339
Take this to the testing area,
put your name at the top,

190
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:03,059
sign the bottom, answer the questions,
bring it back. Next!

191
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:06,410
Excuse me, but I have some
concerns about these questions.

192
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:09,496
Look at that sign up there.

193
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,778
Does it say "I give a damn"?

194
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:17,976
That's because I don't.

195
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:21,410
Just look.
This first question makes no sense.

196
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:25,371
"How many car lengths should you leave
in front of you when driving?"

197
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:27,793
There's no possible way
to answer that.

198
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,876
A "car length" is not
a standardized unit of measure.

199
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:33,522
Look at the sign.

200
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:37,676
- It's "C." Just put down "C."
- I don't need your help, Penny.

201
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:40,596
Listen to that little girl, honey.
Put "C." Next!

202
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:41,889
Wait! Hang on.

203
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:45,476
- Look at this next question.
- Why are you arguing with the DMV?

204
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:49,046
How else are they going to learn?

205
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:52,927
Look... question two:

206
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:55,392
"When are roadways most slippery?"

207
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:57,947
Now, there are 3 answers,
none of which are correct.

208
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:00,693
The correct answer is
"when covered by a film of liquid

209
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,965
"sufficient to reduce
the coefficient of static friction

210
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:05,230
"between the tire and the road
to essentially zero,

211
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,236
"but not so deep as to introduce
a new source of friction."

212
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:15,152
Here's your learner's permit.
Go away.

213
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:17,562
But I'm not done.

214
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:20,052
I have many additional concerns
about these questions.

215
00:13:20,212 --> 00:13:22,471
- Don't make me climb over this counter.
- Come on.

216
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,235
Next!

217
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:28,107
Aced it.

218
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:35,109
That's... it.
Let's boot it up.

219
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:36,310
Booting.

220
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:39,085
This is a state-of-the-art simulator.

221
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:41,907
I adapted it from something
a friend of mine designed for the army.

222
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,221
Is that why I appear to be
in downtown Fallujah

223
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:46,420
behind the wheel
of an up-armored Humvee?

224
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,169
I haven't configured it yet.

225
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:51,071
Let's see...

226
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:52,543
Bradley tank...

227
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:54,753
transport truck...
Batmobile...

228
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,949
Here we go.
Red 2006 Ford Taurus

229
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:01,927
on the streets of Pasadena.

230
00:14:04,105 --> 00:14:04,805
What?

231
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:07,013
Statistically, red cars
are stopped by police

232
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,945
far more often
than any other color.

233
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:11,357
I don't want any hassles
with the fuzz.

234
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:14,565
Fine, what color do you want?

235
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,830
You know the pale blue
of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber?

236
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:22,300
Before it was digitally remastered?

237
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,118
Black, it is.

238
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:30,664
Okay, now, what you want to do first
is turn on the ignition

239
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:32,117
and shift into drive.

240
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:34,251
I haven't fastened
my seat belt yet.

241
00:14:36,862 --> 00:14:38,380
Okay, fasten your seat belt.

242
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,371
- Now, are there air bags?
- You don't need air bags.

243
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,437
What if a simulated van
rear-ends me?

244
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:55,687
I'll hit you in the face
with a pillow.

245
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:06,587
Okay, now shift into drive.

246
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:09,245
Pull out slowly into traffic.

247
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:14,666
Watch out, watch, watch out
for the pedestrians!

248
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,504
Wait-- slow--
Hit the brakes! The brakes!

249
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:31,871
Thank you.

250
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:37,512
Sorry. Excuse me.

251
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:40,911
My bad.

252
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:45,267
Student driver.

253
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:49,097
How did you manage to get
on the 2d floor

254
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:50,747
of the Glendale Galleria?

255
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,171
I don't know.

256
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,834
I was on the Pasadena freeway.
I missed my exit,

257
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:58,873
flew off the overpass,
and one thing led to another.

258
00:16:01,455 --> 00:16:03,799
Maybe you want to give it a rest
and try again tomorrow.

259
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:05,718
I quit.

260
00:16:15,036 --> 00:16:16,210
The pet store...

261
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:20,221
Remind me to compliment Wolowitz
on the software.

262
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:21,928
It's amazingly detailed.

263
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,904
So wait, you're just
gonna give up?

264
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:27,626
No, I'm not giving up.

265
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:28,963
I never give up.

266
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:32,161
So, what is it you're doing?

267
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:33,807
I'm...

268
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:36,083
transcending the situation.

269
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:41,484
I'm clearly

270
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,757
too evolved for driving.

271
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:48,594
What does that mean?

272
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:53,443
Have you ever wondered
why my little toes and lateral incisors

273
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:57,191
are significantly smaller
than the average for someone of my size?

274
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:02,276
I wonder a lot of things about you.
But not-not that.

275
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,330
Well, those are indicators

276
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,516
that I'm farther along
the evolutionary scale

277
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:09,396
- than the average human.
- No kidding.

278
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:10,366
Hold on.

279
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:12,031
I'm not gonna go so far as to say

280
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:14,717
that I represent a distinct
new stage in humankind--

281
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:17,288
you know, a homo novus,
if you will.

282
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,751
That's for anthropologists to decide.

283
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:23,712
But I am convinced

284
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:26,862
that the reason I cannot master
the plebeian task of driving

285
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:28,801
is because I'm not meant to.

286
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,095
Yes, you are.
You're meant to learn how to drive.

287
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:32,635
Please learn how to drive!

288
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:35,663
I'm meant for greater things,

289
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:37,810
like unraveling the mysteries
of the universe,

290
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,417
not determing when it's safe

291
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:42,178
to pass a stopped school bus
on a country road.

292
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:47,275
- It's never safe.
- Yeah, well, I know that now.

293
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,344
Fine.

294
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:52,477
Assuming that everything
you say is true,

295
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:56,328
how does the biologically superior
homo novus get to work tomorrow morning?

296
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,454
Homo novus doesn't know.

297
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:02,741
Well, hang in there.

298
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,754
Maybe you'll evolve
into something with wings.

299
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,007
Good morning, gentlemen.

300
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:20,394
Good morning.

301
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:25,274
Is there some new kind of casual Friday
I don't know about?

302
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,484
No, he lives here now.

303
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:29,710
Really? Why?

304
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:32,658
Since he won't take the bus
and he's too evolved to drive,

305
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,812
he decided it would be easier
to sleep in his office

306
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:36,337
and shower in the radiation lab

307
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:38,245
until I'm finished
with my experiment.

308
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,813
But you finished your experiment
a week ago.

309
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,524
You saw nothing!
