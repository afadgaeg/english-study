00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,338
Wanna spend time playing the new
"Star Wars" game this weekend?

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,508
Mm, I don't know,
I promised myself I'd get off the computer...

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,344
...be more physically active,
get some exercise.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,556
You're about to walk up
three flights of stairs.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,268
Well, good point. I'm in.

6
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,522
You know what would be great?
Let's do it like the old days.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,233
- Mm, you talking gaming marathon?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,654
Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours,
sleeping bags, junk food.

9

so our moms can't call.

10

when the neighbors called the cops on us.

They called the cops because of the smell.
They thought we were dead.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,631
We were bad-ass back in the day.

14
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,220
- All right, let's do it.
- Forty-eight hours of "Star wars" gaming.

15

Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend.

18
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,520
Starting Saturday morning,
"Star Wars" marathon.

19
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,773
- Woo-hoo.
- Movies or video games?

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,858
Or board games? Or trading-card games?

21
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,360
Or Legos? Or dress-up? Or comic books?

22
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,321
Or dramatic readings of novelizations?

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,490
Yes to all.

24
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,535
We are going to play the online game.

25
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,663
The online game? Bully.

26
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,625
As much as I'm sure Sheldon would enjoy...

27
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,628
...playing intergalactic make-believe,
he and I have plans.

28
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,756
We are attending my Aunt Flora's
93rd birthday party.

29
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,092
Just tell her I can't come.

30
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,469
She'll be disappointed if we don't show.

31
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,514
She's 93.
She won't be disappointed for very long.

32
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,810
Hang on. I followed all the protocols...

33
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,437
...set forth by you
in the Relationship Agreement.

34
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,774
I made a written request
72 hours in advance.

35
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,735
Checked the tire pressure on the car.

36
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,904
I contacted the
Centers for Disease Control...

37
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,407
...to find out what shots they
recommend for travel to Orange County.

38
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,161
FYI, it's none.

39
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,413
Amy, the Relationship Agreement...

40
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,250
...was not designed
for either one of us to get our way.

41
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,252
You use it to get your way.

42
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,420
I use it to get the right way.

43
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,300
The fact that the right way
is also my way is a happy coincidence.

44
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,555
You gave me your word.
You're coming with me.

45
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,889
We'll miss you, Sheldon.

46
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,517
Yeah? Well, who wants
to spend the whole weekend...

47
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,104
...running around a bunch of pretend
planets battling made-up monsters?

48
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:31,150
- That's for babies.
- Yeah, but it's got lightsabers.

49
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,778
Yeah. Please, Amy, it's got lightsabers.

50
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,223
- Hello, Stuart.
- Hey, Sheldon.

51
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,017
- Help you with anything?
- Yes.

52
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,854
I'm attending a party this weekend
for a 93-year-old woman.

53
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,566
Can you recommend a gift?

54
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,027
Uh, I don't know.

55
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,363
Could put a tennis ball on the end
of Excalibur...

56
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,325
...make a pretty bad-ass cane.

57
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,243
Do you supply the ball?

58
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,037
- No.
- Then no.

59
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,666
- What else?
- Uh, oh.

60
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,503
Got this collector's edition
Batman Utility Belt.

61
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:37,299
Maybe she could use it
as a wearable pill caddy.

62
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:42,429
Well, she'd just look silly wearing that
without the rest of the costume.

63
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,226
Um, sorry, Sheldon, that's it.
That's all I got.

64
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,103
It's not your fault.
I've been to the model-train store.

65
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:54,316
I've been to Radio Shack.
This woman's impossible to shop for.

66
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,527
I'd make fun of Sheldon
for having girl problems...

67
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,530
...if I wasn't in shock
that Sheldon has girl problems.

68
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,450
Well, Leonard, go ahead and mock.

69
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,118
It's like my daddy always said:

70
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,039
"Shelly, women aren't anything
but flipping pains in the bottom."

71
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,752
That's what your father used to say?

72
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,923
Well, I took out the bad words
and the "yeehaw," but you get the gist.

73
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,761
If you don't wanna go to the party,
just don't go. You're a grown man.

74
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,431
Act like one. Tell Amy you wanna spend
the weekend having a sleepover...

75
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,850
...and playing video games
with your friends.

76
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:34,439
Yeah, maybe she'll dig it.
Women like a firm hand on the tiller.

77
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,108
I can never find the tiller.

78
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,905
I got a book. It didn't help.

79
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,284
Yeah, I always thought
if I were ever enslaved...

80
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,662
...it would be by an advanced species
from another planet...

81
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,957
...not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.

82
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,629

we're in this relationship beta test...

...if I should have asked you first.

89
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,611
Then I thought if
I did check with you first...

90
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,698
...you'd think that
I was taking things too seriously...

91

for a different reaction, but okay.

- Really? What were you hoping for?
- I don't know.

96

Maybe that you'd be a little upset.

And then you'd realize that
I'm a stallion that has to run free.

00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:29,067
...provided the old gal's candle blow
is clean and dry.

165
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:40,704
Here you go. I've got everything
we'll need for the big game.

166
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,915
Low-fat turkey jerky.

167
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,418
Low-carb beer.

168
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,588
Hundred-calorie snack packs.

169
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,925
Pick up a Y chromosome while
you were there? You might be short one.

170
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,721
Hey, I plan on leveling up in the game,
not my swimsuit size...

171
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,598
...thank you very much.

172
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,933
Gentlemen,
the game offers us a choice...

173
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,769
...between playing for the Republic
and the light side...

174
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,772
...or the Sith Empire and the dark side.

175
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,775
We're always the good guys.
In "D&D" we're lawful good.

176
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,778
In "City of Heroes" we're heroes.
In "Grand Theft Auto"...

177
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,240
...we pay the prostitutes promptly
and never hit them with a bat.

178
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,495
Those women are prostitutes?

179
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,791
You said they were raising money
for stem-cell research.

180
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,129
Hey, guys. I got a surprise.

181
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,634
Mm, if it's yogurt that helps ladies poop,
I think Raj beat you to it.

182
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,095
No, Bernadette's gonna be playing with us.

183
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,849
So that's pretty cool, huh?
Right? Sure, it is.

184
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,435
Wha...? You invited your girlfriend?

185
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,647
- This is supposed to be our weekend.
- I had no choice.

186
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,275
She said, "Why don't we go out
for brunch and maybe the arboretum?"

187
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:56,029
I said, "No, I promised the guys I was
gonna play a video game with them."

188
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,157
She said, "Can I come?"
Then I didn't answer for a second.

189
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,368
Then she said,
"Do you not want me to come?"

190
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,328
Then I bought her a new laptop
and the game...

191
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,622
...and she's parking the car now.

192
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,335
Is the whip-sound app
contextually appropriate here?

193
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,798
Uh, it is, but I think you might have
waited too long for it to be funny.

- Amy, what's wrong?
- My boyfriend's a jerk.

200
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,196
Well, I know he didn't cheat on you,
so, what happened?

201
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,409
I had to go to my aunt's party by myself.

202
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:46,037
Everybody was like, "where's this
boyfriend you talk about? Is he real?

203
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,708
Or did you make him up like Armin
the miniature-horse breeder?"

204
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,545
Who's Armin the miniature-horse breeder?

205
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,006
The pretend boyfriend I invented
to get my family off my back.

206
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,177
It unraveled quickly when I couldn't answer
the question "How did you two meet?"

207
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,098
- I would've thought at a horse show.
- Oh, that's good.

208
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,766
Mm.

209
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,437
I panicked and said Woodstock.

Yes, on purpose.

He's handsome, he's lanky, he's brilliant.

217
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,921
His skin has that pale, waxy quality.

218

...when you're in a relationship
with someone you really care about...

222

it leaves you open to getting hurt.

doing that to you?

224

it may interest you to know...

228
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:13,458
...that saying, "Pew, pew, pew," isn't
as effective as pressing your blaster key.

doesn't make the landspeeder go.

I've been worried sick for two days...

324
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,830
...and I know you turned off your phone!

325
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,003
You open up this door right now,
because I've had it up to here!

326
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,338
I have been to the morgue
and the hospital...

327
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,926
...and I've spent the last half-hour
walking up these farkakte stairs!

328
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,432
That's my ride. Gotta go, heh.
