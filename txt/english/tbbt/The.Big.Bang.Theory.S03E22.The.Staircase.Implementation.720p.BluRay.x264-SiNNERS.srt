1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:04,893
Okay, Baby-Doll Pink...

2
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:08,633
...let's see if you can cover up the fact
that I got my dad's feet.

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,676
It's two degrees, Sheldon.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,835
I just wanna turn up
the thermostat two degrees.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,880
Let me point out
that two degrees can be the difference...

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,073
...between water and steam.

7
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,151
Yes, if we were lived in a tea kettle.

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,345
This is the temperature you
agreed to in the roommate agreement.

9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,013
Screw the roommate agreement.

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,250
No, you don't screw
the roommate agreement...

11
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,088
...the roommate agreement screws you.

12
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,529
You know what,
go to hell and set their thermostat.

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:37,602
I don't have to go to hell.
At 73 degrees, I'm there already.

14
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,404
Who is it?

15
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,745
- Leonard.
- Hang on.

16
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,118
Can I sleep on your couch tonight?

17
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:56,586
You can try, but the people
across the hall are being very noisy.

18
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:58,782
You heard that, huh?

19
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,689
Apparently, the one fella
tried to adjust the thermostat...

20
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,558
...then the other fella
went bat-crap crazy.

21
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,895
So you agree he's nuts.

22
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,627
Not as nuts as the guy
who chooses to live with him.

23
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,135
Believe it or not,
he was worse when I met him.

24
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,467
Oh, I do not believe that.

25
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,106
You are so naive.

26
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,108
Just like I was seven years ago.

27
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,414
<i>I'd just started at the university.</i>

28
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,986
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Sheldon Cooper's apartment.

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,593
- Oh. I bet you're here to check out the room.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,626
Run away, dude.

31
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,931
- What?
- Run fast, run far.

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,161
That should've been my first clue.

33
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,497
So Sheldon's last roommate
tried to warn you off?

34
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:18,035
For all I knew, he was the crazy one.

35
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,201
He had this really deranged look.

36
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,365
Well, yeah, he'd been living with Sheldon.

37
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,369
Sure, it makes sense now.

38
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,841
<i>Anyway, I went upstairs
and knocked on the door.</i>

39
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,390
Yeah?

40
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,897
Dr. Cooper?

41
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,028
No, you want the crazy guy
across the hall.

42
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,574
<i>In retrospect, that was clue number two.</i>

43
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,883
- Yes?
- I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

44
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,924
- I called about the apartment. You said...
- I know what I said. I know what you said.

45
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,926
I know what my mother said
on March 5th, 1992.

46
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,423
What is the sixth noble gas?

47
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,499
- What?
- You said you're a scientist.

48
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:25,069
- What is the sixth noble gas?
- Uh, Radon?

49
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,233
Are you asking me or telling me?

50
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,070
Telling you?

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,074
Telling you.

52
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,045
All right. Next question.

53
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,878
Kirk or Picard?

54
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,944
Oh, uh... Well, that's tricky. Um...

55
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:46,786
<i>Well, original series over
Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.</i>

56
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,553
Correct.

57
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,797
You've passed the first barrier
to roommate hood.

58
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,433
You may enter.

59
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,726
Oh, this is pretty nice.

60
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,405
- The bedrooms are back there?
- That depends.

61
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,982
I don't understand.
Their existence is conditional?

62
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,314
No. But your ability to
perceive their existence is conditional...

63
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,922
...on you passing
the second and third barriers.

64
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,750
- There's three?
- Each more daunting than the last.

65
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,661
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

66
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,664
No, that's where I sit.

67
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,832
What's the difference?

68
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,167
This seat is ideally located...

69
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:39,108
...in relation to the heat source in the
winter and a cross breeze in the summer.

70
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,577
It also faces the television
at a direct angle...

71
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,740
...allowing me to immerse myself
in entertainment or game play...

72
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,580
...without being subjected to conversation.
As a result...

73
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,985
...I've placed it in a state of eternal dibs.

74
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,788
Can you do that?

75
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,864
That's Latin for "My chair my rules."

76
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:08,472
Now, you said on the phone
that your area of study is physics.

77
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,870
Yeah, experimental physics.

78
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,373
Hmm.

79
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,645
- What is that?
- Doesn't concern you.

80
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,548
You'll be going to the university
every day?

81
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,015
- Yes.
- Do you have a vehicle?

82
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,052
- A car.
- And you'd be willing to drive me?

83
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:26,158
- Well, can't you drive?
- I can.

84
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,620
I choose not to.

85
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,389
Okay, I suppose I could drive you.

86
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,568
- Well, what's a point in my favor, right?
- Why don't you let me do this?

87
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,895
Come on, I just asked.

88
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,902
Last question.
In a post-apocalyptic world...

89
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,571
...which task would you assign
the highest priority?

90
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,412
Locating a sustainable food source,
reestablishing a functioning government...

91
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,579
...procreation
or preserving the knowledge of mankind?

92
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,923
Uh, I'm gonna go with
preserving the knowledge.

93
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,027
That's correct.

94
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:06,430
FYI, I would've accepted
any answer other than procreating.

95
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,161
Come, I'll show you
the rest of the apartment.

96
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,567
Good. I passed the barriers.

97
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,934
The second barrier. Don't get cocky.

98
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,878
This is the bathroom.

99
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,937
Are you fairly regular?

100
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,884
- Uh... I guess.
- This isn't going to work if you're guessing.

101
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,456
When do you evacuate your bowels?

102
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,060
When I have to.

103
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,253
When you have to?
I'm sorry, I don't rent to hippies.

104
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,299
I'm sorry, in the morning. Around 8.

105
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,932
I can't give you 8. I can give you 7:30.

106
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,140
Fine, I'll take it.

107
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,972
Third barrier passed.

108
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,308
You have won the right to see your room.

109
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,814
Pizah.

110
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,746
- Is this it?
- No, this is my room.

111
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,653
People don't go in my room.

112
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,156
So where do you sleep? Heh.

113
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,823
I don't understand.

114
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,794
If people don't go in there,
and you're people and...

115
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,993
You are people, aren't you?

116
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,629
Making a joke.

117
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,330
Do you do this often?

118
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,836
On occasion.

119
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,116
Your room.

120
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,856
You may wanna repaint.

121
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,686
And after all that you just moved in?

122
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,356
I didn't just move in.
First we had to iron out a few details.

123
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,368
"Roommates agree
that Friday nights shall be reserved...

124
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,531
<i>...for watching Joss Whedon's
brilliant new series, Firefly."</i>

125
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,035
Does that really need to be
in the agreement?

126
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,545
Might as well settle it now,
it's gonna be on for years.

127
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,717
Initial here.

128
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,282
All right, that's television and movies.

129
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,485
"Section nine: Miscellany.

130
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:19,724
The apartment's flag is a gold lion
rampant on a field of azure."

131
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,224
We have a flag?

132
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,910
Never fly it upside down.

133
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,175
Unless the apartment's in distress.

134
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,875
Fine, next.

135
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,680
"If either of us ever invents time travel...

136
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:46,918
...we agree our first stop will be this
meeting today in precisely five seconds."

137
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,659
Okay.

138
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,269
Well, that's disappointing.

139
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,572
Why on earth did you agree to all that?

140
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,615
It was the best apartment I'd seen,
the rent was very reasonable...

141
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:15,778
...and after you pass the first three barriers,
you kind of wanna take it all the way.

142
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,458
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard.
It's very hard to feel sympathy for you.

143
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,721
Okay. Let me tell you about the first time
I brought a girl over.

144
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,565
Leonard?

145
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,030
Shh. Just pretend we're not here.

146
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,461
Leonard?

147
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,939
I'm sure he'll go away.

148
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,772
I'm just gonna keep knocking
till you answer.

149
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,139
Leonard?

150
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,943
Leonard? Leonard?

151
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,483
What do you want?

152
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,746
I didn't say come in.

153
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,947
You asked what I want.

154
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,248
I wanted to come in.

155
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,258
I'm here because you violated
our roommate agreement.

156
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,828
Specifically, section eight...

157
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,831
...visitor's subsection C, females,
paragraph four, coitus.

158
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:07,436
"Roommates shall give each other
12 hours notice of impending coitus."

159
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,098
I didn't even know her 12 hours ago.

160
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,176
That's it, I'm out of here.

161
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,437
Joyce, come on.

162
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,841
Twelve hours?

163
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,343
Oh, my God.

164
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,852
- Do I get some sympathy now?
- Little bit.

165
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:28,854
Let me get this straight.

166
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,486
You move in with this guy, makes
you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement.

167
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,634
Then he walks into your bedroom
while you're doing Joyce Kim...

168
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,826
...and you still stay?

169
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,665
Actually, I couldn't get too mad at him
about Joyce Kim.

170
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,033
Why not?

171
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,869
Well, I was doing some
government research at the time.

172
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,841
You know, military rocket fuels.
Kind of secret.

173
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,675
- What does that have to do with Joyce?
- As it turns out...

174
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,714
...she was a North Korean spy.

175
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,214
Luckily, Sheldon drove her out
before I revealed anything important.

176
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,291
Which I'm not saying I would have.

177
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,388
So you stayed with Sheldon
all this time...

178
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,997
...because he kept you from going
to federal prison?

179
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:10,066
That's part of it. The other part is
what happened with the elevator.

180
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,171
I've been wondering. You said
it was working when you moved in.

181
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,399
It was. But one night
Sheldon came home from work...

182
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,249
What is going on here?

183
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,886
Hey, this is Howard and Raj.
They work at the university too.

184
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,082
- Hey.
- Hey.

185
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,385
I'll get to you later.

186
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,254
What are you sitting on?

187
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,729
I can't speak for these guys,
but I'm sitting on my tushy. Heh, heh.

188
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,030
- It's a joke.
- Not a good idea.

189
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,772
- "Tushy" is "buttocks," right?
- Right.

190
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,670
Heh. Hilarious. Heh, heh.

191
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,077
Explain the couch.

192
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:55,942
There were people on the first floor
who were moving out and sold it for $100.

193
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,607
- Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.
- What's wrong with the furniture we have?

194
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,020
They are lawn chairs.

195
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,215
There was no place for company.

196
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,888
Did it occur to you that was by design?

197
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,520
According to the roommate agreement,
I'm entitled to allocate 50 percent...

198
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,599
...of the cubic footage
of common areas.

199
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,601
But you didn't notify me by e-mail,
so this is still a breach.

200
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,437
I did notify you.

201
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,939
Oh, you did, did you?

202
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,822
Drat.

203
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,453
Hoisted by my own spam filter.

204
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,998
- What am I doing in your spam?
- I put you there after you forwarded me...

205
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,159
...a picture of a cat playing
the piano entitled "T his is funny."

206
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,971
Oh, yeah. I saw that. That was hilarious.
Heh-heh-heh.

207
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,168
- What's this have to do with the elevator?
- I'm getting to it.

208
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:03,343
I assure you, you'll be sorry
you wasted your money on an iPod...

209
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,007
...when Microsoft comes out with theirs.

210
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,447
Okay, do you have an opinion
about everything?

211
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,514
Yes.

212
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,658
You just assume you're always right?

213
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,123
It's not an assumption.

214
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,461
- Change seats with me.
- Why?

215
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,364
I don't like this spot.
I have to keep turning my head.

216
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,369
Fine.

217
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,202
<i>It's time for Babylon 5.</i>

218
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,809
<i>We don't watch Babylon 5
in this apartment.</i>

219
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:35,004
<i>- Why not?
- Because no one likes Babylon 5.</i>

220
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,614
- I like it.
- Me too.

221
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,808
- So do I.
- There you go, three against one.

222
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,317
They don't get a vote. It's one against one.

223
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,856
And according to the roommate agreement,
all ties will be settled by me.

224
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,385
- But I said no to that.
- And I said yes.

225
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,021
And I settle all ties.

226
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,134
- Change seats with me.
- Why?

227
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,034
There's a draft on my neck over here.

228
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,731
So I get the draft?

229
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,036
You're protected by your turtleneck.

230
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,545
Fine.

231
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,415
And it's a dickey.

232
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,687
Hmm...

233
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,590
I'm still not comfortable.

234
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,031
Of course,
there's too many people here.

235
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,531
We can fix that. Let's leave.

236
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,334
Yeah, we can go over to my place.

237
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,565
Wait, let me get my jacket.

238
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,944
- You're not going with us.
- Why not?

239
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,946
You're the guy
we're trying to get away from.

240
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,110
Oh.

241
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,047
In that case, I don't need my jacket.

242
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,212
And for the record,
the correct syntax is:

243
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,416
"I'm the guy from whom
you're trying to get away."

244
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,098
Oh, yes.

245
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,304
This is definitely gonna be my spot.

246
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,612
Okay. How do you know he said that?
You left the room.

247
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,307
Hey, do you want me to finish
working on your man-feet or not?

248
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,313
Fine. Go ahead.

249
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,445
Howard, are you having a playdate?!

250
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,787
I don't have playdates! I have colleagues!

251
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,396
Do their parents know they're here?!

252
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,295
No, but if you keep screaming,
maybe they'll hear you!

253
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,297
That your dad?

254
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,641
She grows any more hair on her face, yes.

255
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,110
Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?

256
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,014
Three. I designed the engine myself.

257
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,155
Cool. Can it break Mach 1?

258
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,257
Oh, probably, if I could get
my hands on that new fuel...

259
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,120
...the government's been working on.

260
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,125
Oh, this just might be your lucky day.

261
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:08,825
Howard, what happened to
the Oreos I left on the counter?!

262
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,771
I haven't seen your Oreos!

263
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,032
Just take your bath without them!

264
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,346
So why was it his lucky day?

265
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,142
It turns out I had a little rocket fuel
in the apartment.

266
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,842
What were you doing with
rocket fuel in your apartment?

267
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,487
Joyce Kim was curious
about what I did for a living...

268
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,351
...and I was gonna
kind of show it to her.

269
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,521
The point is, the guys and I
went back to the apartment.

270
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:41,394
- Are we ever gonna get to the elevator?
- We're close. We're at the apartment.

271
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,128
The trick is to mix it into Tovex in
order to create a combustible gel...

272
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,398
...that will generate over
8000 kilonewtons of thrust.

273
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,734
- Cool.
- Nice.

274
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,536
Won't work.

275
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,713
Excuse me, but I've been
working on this a long time.

276
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,212
Trust me, it'll work.

277
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,179
You don't see your mistake, do you?

278
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,750
There's no mistake.

279
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,547
This is for a full scale rocket,
not a model.

280
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:06,385
- Well, I've adjusted the formula.
- Not correctly.

281
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,390
Okay, I've had it with you.

282
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:12,361
You might be an expert on theoretical
physics and science fiction programs...

283
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,024
...and where to sit on a freaking couch,
but this is applied physics.

284
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,171
And when it comes to applied physics...
Uh-oh.

285
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,670
- What's happening?
- A bad thing. A very bad thing.

286
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:23,866
Get the door.

287
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,274
Get the door. Get the door. Get the door.

288
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,026
- You're waiting for the elevator?
- Oh, right.

289
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,756
- Wait. It's here.
- Ah!

290
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,290
Give me that.

291
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,463
What'd you do that for?
I had plenty of time.

292
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,635
You're welcome.

293
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,478
Not only did Sheldon save my life,
he didn't rat me out to the landlord.

294
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,646
Or the police. Or Homeland Security.

295
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,483
So you're the reason...

296
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,594
...I have to walk up and down
three flights of stairs every day?

297
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,595
So I did something stupid.
I'm sure you did stupid things.

298
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,460
What were you doing seven years ago?

299
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,001
Excuse me, I was in high school.
Studying, keeping my nose clean...

300
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,105
...doing volunteer work
for the community.

301
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:34,007
Not pregnant. Yes!

302
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,576
Ha, ha!

303
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:45,988
Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favorite
Linux-based operating system.

304
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,286
- Hey.
- Hello.

305
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,325
Why do I smell methacrylate?

306
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,365
Oh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi.

307
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,334
Men can get those.

308
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,369
Anyway, I may owe you an apology.

309
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,443
There's doubt?

310
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,506
I did agree to the thermostat setting
and I shouldn't have tried to change it.

311
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,639
That's not an apology.

312
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,512
That's simply an acknowledgment
that I was right.

313
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,280
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- There you go.

314
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,013
So we're good?

315
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:22,388
- Good what?
- Never mind.

316
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:26,293
- Okay if I watch some TV?
- Go ahead.

317
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,691
<i>Up next: Babylon 5.</i>

318
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,303
- You're not even watching.
- I can hear it.

319
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,372
Oh, so the dialogue offends you?

320
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,566
I would hardly call that dialogue.

321
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,335
You are insane, you know that?

322
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,380
Don't make me turn that flag
upside down because you know I'll do it.
