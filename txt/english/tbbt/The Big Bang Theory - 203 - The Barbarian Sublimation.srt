1
00:00:01,022 --> 00:00:02,266
Fellow warriors,

2
00:00:02,499 --> 00:00:04,206
this is Sheldor the Conqueror.

3
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:06,286
We are about to enter
Axidus' fortress.

4
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,675
Now, this is a long run,
so let's do another bladder check.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,041
OK, Barry,
we'll wait for you again,

6
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:16,220
but you really should see a doctor.

7
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:22,043
Sheldor is AFK.

8
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:29,971
Are you experiencing
some sort of difficulty?

9
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,410
Yes. I can't get
my stupid door open.

10
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:34,867
You appear to have put
your car key in the door lock,

11
00:00:34,987 --> 00:00:36,481
are you aware of that?

12
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:40,784
All right, then.

13
00:00:42,773 --> 00:00:43,588
Damn it.

14
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:48,802
Would it be possible for you
to do this a little more quietly?

15
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,463
I can't get
the damn key out.

16
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:54,389
It's not surprising--
that Baldwin lock on your door

17
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:56,367
uses traditional
edge-mounted cylinders,

18
00:00:56,487 --> 00:00:59,950
whereas the key for your Volkswagen
uses a center cylinder system.

19
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:03,589
Thank you.

20
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:05,939
You're welcome.

21
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,365
Point of inquiry: why did you put
your car key in the door lock?

22
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:12,577
Why?
Because today I had an audition,

23
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,452
it took me two hours to get there,

24
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:17,063
I waited an hour for my turn,
and before I could even start,

25
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:19,244
they told me I looked
too Midwest for the part.

26
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:21,418
Too Midwest.
What the hell does that even mean?

27
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:25,461
The American Midwest was mostly settled
by Scandinavian and Germanic people.

28
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:28,341
They have a characteristic
facial bone...

29
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:30,110
I know what it means!

30
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:33,471
God! I have been in L.A.
for almost two years now,

31
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:35,765
and I haven't gotten
a single acting job.

32
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,308
I've accomplished nothing,

33
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:40,167
haven't gotten any raise at work,
haven't even had sex in 6 months,

34
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:42,355
and just now,
when I was walking up those stairs,

35
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:44,655
a fly flew in my mouth
and I ate it!

36
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:49,393
Actually, insects are a dietary staple
in many cultures.

37
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:51,288
They're almost pure protein.

38
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:53,375
Oh, son of a bitch!

39
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:57,016
I believe the condensation
on your frozen foods

40
00:01:57,136 --> 00:01:59,497
weakened the structural
integrity of the bag.

41
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:07,489
But returning to your key conundrum,
perhaps you should call a locksmith

42
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:09,652
- and have him open the door for you.
- I did.

43
00:02:09,772 --> 00:02:11,634
He said he'll get here
when he gets here.

44
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:14,004
You're frustrated
because he phrased his reply

45
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:16,431
in the form
of a meaningless tautology?

46
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:19,778
I am frustrated because
I am a failure at everything

47
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:21,748
and my breath smells like fly.

48
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:27,991
There, there.

49
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:38,328
Would you prefer to wait
in our apartment?

50
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:40,523
No, I'd rather sit
on this freezing-cold floor

51
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:42,541
sobbing like a three-year-old.

52
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:44,122
All right, then.

53
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:46,932
For God's sake.

54
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:52,782
Just when I think
I've gotten the hang of sarcasm.

55
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:17,994
Subtitles:
sub-way.fr / seriessub.com / forom.com

56
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:20,693
Make yourself comfortable.

57
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,559
Not there.

58
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:54,309
Sheldor is back online.

59
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:57,031
Sheldor?

60
00:03:58,286 --> 00:03:59,500
The Conqueror.

61
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,707
What are you doing?

62
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,789
AFK.

63
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:09,480
I'm playing Age of Conan,
an online multiplayer game

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,589
set in the universe of
Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian.

65
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:17,322
Sheldor back online.

66
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,892
- What's "AFK"?
- AFK.

67
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:25,300
Away From Keyboard.

68
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:28,104
Oh, I see.

69
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:30,950
What does that stand for?

70
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:37,102
Oh, I see.

71
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,157
Yes, but what does
it stand for?

72
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,009
Just click on the enchanted boots
to put them on.

73
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:01,027
I don't know--
can I see them in another color?

74
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:03,640
Just click on them.

75
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:05,791
Congratulations.

76
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,998
You are now a level-three warrior.

77
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:11,689
- What's going on?
- Guess what? I'm a level-three warrior.

78
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:13,524
Great.

79
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:16,254
Do you know there are groceries
outside of your apartment?

80
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:20,302
I only bring it up because
your ice cream's melting

81
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:22,367
and it's starting
to attract wildlife.

82
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:25,818
Do I stay in the jungle
or go towards the beach?

83
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:28,873
It doesn't matter-- right now;
you're looking for treasure.

84
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,544
- Wait, where are you going?
- No, no. You're okay.

85
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:36,853
If you run into crocodiles,
just kick them with your boots.

86
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:41,238
You want to catch me up?

87
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:43,199
Well, let's see,

88
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,082
she attempted to open
her apartment with her car key

89
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:48,653
because her face
is overly Midwestern...

90
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,972
she hasn't had sex in six months...

91
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,105
and she ate a fly.

92
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,399
Seriously?
Six months?

93
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,074
Oh, my God!
A treasure chest! I'm rich!

94
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:06,443
Level three,
and she thinks she's rich.

95
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:11,322
What a newb.

96
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:16,954
We're all set.

97
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:18,517
Let her rip.

98
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:36,107
Check it out--
it's just corn starch and water.

99
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,381
They make up a non-Newtonian fluid,
which is liquid,

100
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:45,235
but solid under the percussive
action of the speaker.

101
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,395
That's what makes it get all funky.

102
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:54,167
Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.

103
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:01,674
No, that's what she said--
Sheldon.

104
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:05,803
I bought the game, and I've been
exploring the island of Tortage,

105
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:07,988
but I don't know
how to get past the Guard Captain.

106
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,725
- Do you have the Enchanted Sword?
- No, I have a bronze dagger.

107
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:13,152
You can't slay the Guard
with a bronze dagger.

108
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:16,105
My Lord, it's like the car key
in your apartment door all over again.

109
00:07:16,265 --> 00:07:19,384
- All right, how do I get the sword?
- Have you been to the Temple of Mitra?

110
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:22,307
Is that the place on the hill
with the weird priest in front of it?

111
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:25,356
- It's... Oh, for God's sakes, gimme.
- Thank you-- I really appreciate.

112
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:27,784
You're gonna have to learn
to do these things for yourself.

113
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:30,201
Don't patronize me--
just get the sword!

114
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,733
What the frack?

115
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:38,295
Beats me.
They were playing all last night, too.

116
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:41,720
It's like some kind
of weird comic book crossover.

117
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,289
Like if Hulk were dating
Peppermint Patty.

118
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:48,225
I always thought
Peppermint Patty was a lesbian.

119
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:49,653
No, that's Marcie.

120
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,756
Peppermint Patty's just athletic.

121
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,098
There you go--
one Enchanted Sword.

122
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:58,050
All right, gimme, gimme.
I want to kill the Guard Captain.

123
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,737
That girl needs to get a life.

124
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:27,368
Danger! Danger!

125
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:31,395
No danger-- it's just me, Penny.
Listen, I got to level 25

126
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:33,099
and reached Purple Lotus Swamp.

127
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:34,934
You're in my bedroom.

128
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:39,011
- Leonard gave me an emergency key.
- People can't be in my bedroom.

129
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:42,567
- Can we go talk in the living room?
- I'm not wearing pajama bottoms.

130
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,523
- Why not?
- I spilled grape juice.

131
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:48,786
Wear different pajamas.

132
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:51,617
I can't wear different pajamas--
these are my Monday pajamas.

133
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:54,537
People cannot be in my bedroom.

134
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:57,999
Fine, just tell me, is it too soon
to join a quest to the Black Castle?

135
00:08:58,648 --> 00:09:01,210
You were invited on a quest
to the Black Castle?

136
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,698
By some guys in Budapest.

137
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:05,631
I'm just not sure it's the right move
for my character.

138
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:08,519
Of course it's not--
you're only a level 25.

139
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,921
These Hungarians, they're just
using you for dragon fodder.

140
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:16,844
Really? Boy, you'd think you could trust
a horde of Hungarian barbarians.

141
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:21,397
Please, Penny, enough.
I have to sleep.

142
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:25,822
Okay, you were great.
Thanks.

143
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:32,366
Listen, don't go in Sheldon's room.
He's not wearing bottoms.

144
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:41,911
Sheldon, you want
to catch me up again?

145
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:48,049
People, I'm very busy today.

146
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,054
I realize that, Dr. Gablehauser,

147
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,991
but it's your job,
as head of the department,

148
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:53,846
to mediate
all interdepartmental disputes.

149
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:56,510
University Policy Manual,
Chapter Four, Subsection Two:

150
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,935
"Mediation
of Interdepartmental Disputes."

151
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:01,341
Fine.

152
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,562
Dr. Winkle, what colorful name
did you call Dr. Cooper this time?

153
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:07,736
Dr. Dumb-Ass.

154
00:10:10,688 --> 00:10:12,778
Dr. Cooper,
Dr. Winkle apologizes.

155
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,399
- I don't.
- She doesn't.

156
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,578
Here's the problem.
I was clearly signed up

157
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:19,455
to use the mainframe in Buckman 204,

158
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:22,583
and Dr. Winkle just wantonly
ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.

159
00:10:22,743 --> 00:10:25,212
It wasn't an official sign-up sheet.
He printed it himself,

160
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:28,082
and he put his name down
on every slot for the next 6 months.

161
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,718
If it is a crime to ensure
that the university's resources

162
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:34,736
are not being squandered
chasing subatomic wild geese,

163
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:36,389
then I plead guilty.

164
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:42,311
- Penny!
- Do you need to get that, Dr. Cooper?

165
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:43,472
God, no.

166
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:46,730
Don't turn it off, you might miss
your call from the Nobel committee

167
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,897
telling you you've been nominated
as Dumb-Ass Laureate of the Year.

168
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,464
Oh, yeah? Well...

169
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,074
you wouldn't even be nominated.

170
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,808
Dr. Gablehauser, I have a series

171
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,306
of important calculations
and simulations to run.

172
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:06,369
All she's doing is
reducing irrelevant data

173
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,917
- and making a mock...
- Excuse me.

174
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,384
It's for you.

175
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,696
Penny, this is not a good time.

176
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:22,628
No, I told you,

177
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,229
you're not prepared
for the Sanctum of Burning Souls.

178
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:29,029
You need to be in a group
of at least 5 for that quest

179
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:30,930
and one should be
a level 35 healer.

180
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:32,820
I can't log on and help you.

181
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,541
We'll talk when I get home.

182
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:44,160
I'm not getting
the computing time, am I?

183
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:46,200
Dumb-ass.

184
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:53,382
Leonard, you have to do
something about Penny.

185
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:56,883
She is interfering with my sleep,
she's interfering with my work,

186
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:59,189
and if I had another significant
aspect of my life,

187
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:01,641
I'm sure she'd be interfering
with that, too.

188
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:06,287
Why should I do something?
<i>You</i> introduced her to online gaming.

189
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:09,999
Yes, but you're the one who said hello
to her when she moved in.

190
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:14,278
If you'd simply restrained yourself,
none of this would be happening.

191
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:18,305
- Just tell her to leave you alone.
- I did, I told her,

192
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:21,160
I texted her, I sent out
a very emphatic twitter.

193
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:23,036
I even changed my Facebook
status to

194
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,391
"Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny
would leave him alone."

195
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,999
I don't know what else to do.

196
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:30,356
- Well, what am I supposed to do?
- I don't know,

197
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:32,544
but if you don't figure something out,
I warn you,

198
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,892
I shall become
very difficult to live with.

199
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:39,177
You mean up until now
we've been experiencing

200
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:41,022
the happy, fun-time Sheldon?

201
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:43,840
- Yes.
- I'll go talk to her.

202
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,125
No, Fritz, I need you on my flank.

203
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:51,793
No, I don't know German.
<i>Flanken sie, flanken sie.</i>

204
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,672
- Hey, Penny.
- Busy.

205
00:12:57,908 --> 00:13:00,157
Yeah, I see that.
Shouldn't you be at work?

206
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:01,701
I don't work on Mondays.

207
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:03,370
It's Thursday.

208
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:09,507
- Listen, Penny...
- Queen Penelope, AFK. What...?

209
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:16,274
Here's the thing.

210
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:18,823
Sometimes people,
good people,

211
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:21,137
start playing these games
and they find themselves,

212
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:24,932
through no fault of their own,
kind of... addicted.

213
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:27,083
Get to the point.
I'm about to level up here.

214
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,114
If a person doesn't have a sense
of achievement in their real life,

215
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:33,126
it's easy to lose themselves
in a virtual world

216
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,443
where they can get a false
sense of accomplishment.

217
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:38,230
Yeah, jabber, jabber.
Boys, Queen Penelope's back online.

218
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:41,909
Penny, you've got...

219
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:43,847
Cheetos in your hair.

220
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:47,753
Thanks.

221
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,475
Hey, Penny, it's me again, Leonard.

222
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:04,638
I said not now.

223
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:07,016
I know, I'm just a little
concerned about you.

224
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:08,344
I said not now!

225
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,022
Okay, maybe later.

226
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,519
Hey, guys.

227
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,693
- What's with him?
- Penny's been keeping him up at night.

228
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:20,876
Me, too.

229
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:26,921
But probably in a different way.

230
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:30,012
She's gotten really
hooked on Age of Conan.

231
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:33,209
- She's playing nonstop.
- Yes, online gaming addiction.

232
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:37,032
There's nothing worse than having
that multi-player monkey on your back.

233
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:41,246
- Sheldon, wake up!
- Danger! Danger!

234
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:44,340
Afternoon, men.

235
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:49,721
Your attempt at juvenilizing me

236
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,329
by excluding me from the set
of adult males, just...

237
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,304
I'm too tired to do this.

238
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:59,129
I heard you've been pulling all-nighters
with Middle Earth Barbie.

239
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:03,476
She comes into my room.
No one's supposed to be in my room.

240
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:07,242
I would postulate that she's escaping
into the online world

241
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:09,286
to compensate
for her sexual frustration.

242
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:10,704
I do that, too.

243
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:15,339
But probably in a different way.

244
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:18,983
That's not what she's doing, Leslie.

245
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:21,262
She's just trying to shore up
her self-esteem.

246
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:24,051
- It has nothing to do with sex.
- Everything has to do with sex.

247
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:25,766
Testify.

248
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:29,807
I'm not touching that.

249
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:34,103
You are way off base here.

250
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:35,226
Hang on.

251
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:37,622
While I have no respect
for Leslie as a scientist

252
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:39,400
or a human being,
for that matter,

253
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:43,238
we have to concede her
undeniable expertise

254
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:46,818
in the interrelated fields
of promiscuity and general sluttiness.

255
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,244
Thank you.

256
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,997
My point is that Tinkerbell
just needs to get her some.

257
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:54,611
Some what?

258
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:57,023
Yes, some sexual intercourse.

259
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,856
I'll take the bullet.

260
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,268
Excuse me,
this whole idea is insane.

261
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:06,302
Enough debate,
I'm going to take action.

262
00:16:07,785 --> 00:16:08,791
Excuse me.

263
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,182
Are you currently involved
in a sexual relationship?

264
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,366
Would you like to be?

265
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:21,566
Sure, why not?

266
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:27,692
Can I have your phone number?

267
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:44,790
There. Problem solved.

268
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:48,941
Dumb-ass.

269
00:16:57,429 --> 00:16:59,776
Okay, I'm at the gate
of the Treasury of the Ancients.

270
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:01,677
- I'm going in.
- Stay close to the wall.

271
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:03,317
- Avoid the mummies.
- Got it.

272
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:08,072
I must say you're playing very well
for a woman of 23.

273
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:10,074
- Twenty-two.
- Right, 22.

274
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,599
Here come the mummies.
Which spell do I use,

275
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:17,581
the hateful strike
or the frenzy stance?

276
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:19,083
What happened to your group?

277
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:21,289
I dumped them,
they're a bunch of wussies.

278
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,427
- Frenzy stance.
- Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!

279
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,526
So, listen,

280
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:31,955
would you describe
your ideal vacation

281
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:34,244
as a wild adventure
to unknown lands

282
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,600
or staying at home curled up
with a good book?

283
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:39,625
- What?
- These are market research questions.

284
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:42,398
I'm filling out the online
registration for your game.

285
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,233
Okay, wild adventure.

286
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:48,096
Frenzy stance isn't working.
Die, you undead mummy, die!

287
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,151
- Healing potion.
- Thank you.

288
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:51,325
You're welcome.

289
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,590
Anyhow, on a scale
of one to five,

290
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,106
with one being
always initiated by him

291
00:17:58,226 --> 00:18:00,725
and five being
always initiated by you,

292
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:03,669
how do you prefer
your sexual encounters to begin?

293
00:18:04,873 --> 00:18:07,761
- That's on the registration?
- Yes, it's quite extensive.

294
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,123
But if we complete it,
you get a free expansion pack.

295
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:12,928
75 additional quests.

296
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:15,831
Awesome. I totally like to initiate.
I'm a big ol' five.

297
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:18,440
Good to know.

298
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:20,033
Big ol' five.

299
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:33,824
Leonard, this is Tom.

300
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:38,829
Hi, Tom. Sheldon...

301
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:44,541
Didn't I explain to you

302
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,982
about your little mistake
in the cafeteria?

303
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,966
You were very clear.
As was everyone else at the table.

304
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:54,843
Tom, however,
has been chosen by science

305
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:56,744
as a suitable mate for Penny.

306
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:58,849
Chosen by science?

307
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,435
Well, what passes for science
on dating sites.

308
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:04,523
They claim to use
heuristic algorithms,

309
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,215
but it may well be hokum.

310
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,735
You got Penny to sign up
for online dating?

311
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:11,248
No, of course not.

312
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:13,348
See, I used trickery and deceit.

313
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:17,141
This is bad.

314
00:19:17,686 --> 00:19:19,648
Tom is a paramedic
with the fire department,

315
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:21,396
but he's going to med school at night.

316
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:22,895
He likes the outdoors

317
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:25,262
and strong women
who initiate sex.

318
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:28,148
Really, really bad.

319
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,117
I'm surprised
you struck out with Penny.

320
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,297
Apparently,
she's a big ol' five.

321
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:38,889
- Sheldon, what do you want?
- Good,

322
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:41,265
you got my note.
I'd like you to meet Tom.

323
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:42,839
Penny, this is Tom.

324
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,563
Tom, may I present Penny.

325
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,274
- Hi, Penny.
- Yeah, hi. Listen,

326
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:49,650
as long as I'm here,
I'm on a quest with a bunch of newbs.

327
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,040
We've got one assassin,
3 spell casters and no tank.

328
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,562
- Can we talk about this later?
- No, no. I need you now.

329
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:56,740
Wouldn't you prefer
to socialize with Tom,

330
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:58,896
who is a sexually passive
outdoorsman?

331
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,722
Whatever.
I'll figure it out myself.

332
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:04,896
Bye, Penny.

333
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:09,826
I'm sorry, dude, she didn't look
anything like her picture.

334
00:20:12,097 --> 00:20:13,236
They never do.

335
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:22,349
- Hello, fair Penny.
- Who are you?

336
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:24,476
It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz.

337
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:29,398
Can I interest you
in an afternoon of spirited questing

338
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:32,151
followed by a flagon of ale
at Yon Virtual Tavern?

339
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,278
Yeah, sure, why not?

340
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,574
Oh, my God, I need help.
