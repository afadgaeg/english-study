1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,174
- What are you doing?
- Oh, Priya's calling in a few minutes...

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,802
...on Skype
and we are gonna have a dinner date.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,223
It's 8:00 in the morning in Mumbai.

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,350
How can she have dinner?

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,853
Whatever.
Priya will be having breakfast.

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,148
All right.
So technically, it's not a dinner date.

7
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,609
I suppose you could call it
a, uh, dinfast date.

8
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,030
But if you did, you'd open yourself
to peer-based mocking...

9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,950
...such as, "Hey, Leonard, how was
your dinfast with Priya last night?"

10
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,869
That doesn't sound like mocking.

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,537
You didn't let me finish.

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,831
Dinfast.

13
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,916
Are those soy-based candles?

14
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,501
I don't know. Why?

15
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:47,296
Paraffin candles
may contain carcinogens.

16
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:52,051
Unless lung cancer is the ambiance
you were going for at your dinfast.

17
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,386
Dinfast.

18
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,058
I don't wanna be rude,
but Priya's gonna be calling, so...

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,726
Oh, yes. Priya.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,438
Leonard, you know I make a point...

21
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,649
...of never interfering
in your personal affairs.

22
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,863
Yes, I've always admired that
about you.

23
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,156
As well you should.

24
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,575
But I'm going to make
an exception here.

25
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,243
Oh, good.

26
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,581
Priya has moved back to India
to pursue her law career.

27
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:28,378
Instead of desperately trying to keep
this intercontinental relationship alive...

28
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:32,424
...you could use that time
to take up a hobby.

29
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,886
- A hobby?
- Yes.

30
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:42,810
I read recently about a fellow in Kansas
with an enormous ball of twine.

31
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,897
I bet you could give him
a run for his money.

32
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,483
You know, some people might say...

33
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,361
...that it's great that we're trying
to make things work.

34
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,615
They'd say things like, "Love is stronger
than the miles between you."

35
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:01,411
When I rise to power,
those people will be sterilized.

36
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,874
You video chat with Amy all the time.
How is this different?

37
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,417
Don't you like Amy?

38
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,295
- Of course, I like Amy.
- Well, there's the difference.

...when your romantic partners
could be returned to the video store.

45
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,192
Thanks for letting me stay here while
Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.

Oh, it's no problem.

It's actually kind of nice.
You reading, me reading.

We're like an old married couple.

If we were an old married couple...

50
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,914
...the wife would serve iced tea
and snickerdoodles.

51
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,626
I don't have iced tea
and snickerdoodles.

52

Well, I'm glad you like it.

I mean, I still can't get over the fact
someone just threw it away.

- It was just sitting on the street.

64
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,798
I paid a homeless guy

You need to remove that chair

00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,618
Shh...

171
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,662
Just be quiet and do what I tell you.

172
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,747
Okay, like usual, good.

173
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,249
Take off your shirt.

174
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,043
Alrighty.

- Yes, ma'am.

179
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,723
Now take off your shorts.

180
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,976
Taking shorts off.

181
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,772
There we go.

182
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,149
Naked, naked, naked.

183
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,528
Wonderful.
Now I'll take off my clothes.

184
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,697
Cool.

185
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,372
Uh-oh.

186
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,791
Here I am, baby.

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,043
You miss these?

188
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,547
- Damn it.
- Oh, Leonard. Already?

189
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,717
No, no, no.

190
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,055
The screen froze.
It's probably just buffering.

191
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,558
- Just give it a second?
- Fine.

192
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,359
So how are your mom and dad?

193
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,988
I really don't want to talk
about my parents.

194
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,948

You're good friends with Penny, right?

Best friends, besties.
BFFs, peas-in-a-pod...

I was hoping she might listen to you...

...about the dangers
of owning unhygienic furniture.

...or has she acquired a bar stool
dipped in cholera?

225
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,051
Cholera is water-borne.
You're mocking me.

226
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,845
Yes, I am.

227
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,850
Penny has dragged a chair in off
the street whose unknown provenance...

228
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,478
...jeopardizes the health and welfare
of every resident in our building.

Will you listen to me

237
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,258
No. I dislike the sound of the harp.

00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,469
Its overuse
in classic television sitcoms...

239
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,432
...always makes me think I'm going
to experience an episode from my past.

00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,644
I'm sorry, Mommy. Don't be mad at me.
Don't do that.

00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,025
I don't know about this, Howard.

242
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,570
What? You're having trouble
with the long-distance love-making.

243
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,946
This is your answer.

244
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,617
There are two interfaces
that simulate a human mouth.

245
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:14,537
You have one, Priya has one in India.
When you move your lips and tongue...

246
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,248
...it transmits exactly
what you're doing to hers.

247
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,834
See? Internet kissing.

248
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,509
Give it a try.

249
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,054
I don't think so.

250
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,723
I'll try it.

251
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,355
Like this?

252
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,606
Almost.

253
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,109
Really get your tongue in there
to activate the motion sensor.

254
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,196
Like this?

255
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,575
- Close. Really French it.
- All right.

256
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,752
- Better?
- Yeah, you got it, you got it.

257
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,007
I'm impressed. This is very lifelike.

258
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,135
Whoa, you just bit my tongue.

259
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,596
Oh, I nibbled. I was being playful.

260
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,309

make everything weird?

- Better?
- Oh, yeah.

00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,996
Pretty cool, huh? Probably would have
cost, like, 200 bucks in a store.

264
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,664
I do appreciate a bargain.

265
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,418
This entire ensemble
once belonged to my dead grandmother.

266
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,754
- You're kidding?
- Everything except bra and panties.

267

They're a leopard-spotted secret
I share with Victoria.

And now me, heh.

00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,848
I just have one question
about the chair.

270
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,558
And what's that?

271
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,686
Aren't you worried about it
being unhygienic?

272

No. It's completely fi...

273
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,609
Hmm.

00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,155
I get it. Sheldon sent you.
He put you up to this.

275
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,448
- No, he didn't.
- Really?

276
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,367
Yes, he did, he absolutely did.

Oh, my God, Amy,
that's really crappy of you.

- It is?
- Yeah.

to manipulate me?

00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,334
I thought you were my friend.

No, I am your friend.
Please don't be mad at me.

I can't even believe this.
Maybe you should just go.

No, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I take it all back.
