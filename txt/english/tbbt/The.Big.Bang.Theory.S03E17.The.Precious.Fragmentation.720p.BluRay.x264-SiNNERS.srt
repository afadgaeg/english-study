1
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:06,003
Why do I always have
to carry the heavy stuff?

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,333
Well, it's very simple.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,500
In our ragtag band of scientists
with nothing to lose...

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,145
...I'm the smart one.
Wolowitz is the funny one.

5
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,247
Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner...

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,815
...who struggles to understand our ways
and fails.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,550
That leaves you, by default,
as the muscle.

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,819
One more floor
and I'd be the pulled muscle.

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,053
Oh, it's about time. I'm starving.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,165
Uh, well,
we didn't actually get Chinese food.

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,726
- Why not?
- Don't panic. This is better.

12
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:39,270
Oh, no. You didn't trade the food
for magic beans, did you?

13
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,874
Of course not. And, technically,
magic beans would be food.

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,911
Eating them would be a waste,
since you could plant them...

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,915
...and have a giant beanstalk which
would provide roughage for a small city.

16
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,009
Yeah, sometimes I don't listen.

17
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,519
Sometimes I just watch your jaw
go up and down.

18
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,886
We were on our way to the restaurant.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,187
We saw Adam West, so we followed him.

20
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,559
- Who's Adam West?
- Who's Adam West?

21
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,690
What do the two of you
talk about after the coitus?

22
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,901
My guess is,
"Hey, four minutes. New record."

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,905
That's why I'm the funny one.

24
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,711
Anyway, we followed the guy
to this garage sale.

25
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,213
They had the coolest stuff.

26
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,284
They were closing up.
We got this whole box for 60 bucks.

27
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,887
We didn't go through it.
There could be anything.

28
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,581
There a new girlfriend in there?
You might need one.

29
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:36,590
<i>No, but there is an original final draft
Ghostbusters script...</i>

30
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,424
...with actual slime stains.

31
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,559
<i>Oh, you're right, it's Ghostbusters Il.
Never mind.</i>

32
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,969
Oh, my God.

33
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,072
An ALF doll.

34
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:58,074
When I was 11, my mother got me one
to help me sleep after my dad left.

35
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:02,745
I used to pretend that my dad
had moved to the planet Melmac...

36
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:06,586
...and ALF was gonna bring him back
to me.

37
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,594
But he never did.

38
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,754
Where's my daddy, puppet?

39
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,627
Where is he?

40
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,097
That is so sad.

41
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,301
No, what's sad is that you don't know
that Adam West was TV's Batman.

42
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:55,068
Here's Spock's head with no body.

43
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,544
Here's Mr. T's body with no head.

44
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,911
Oh, yeah, here's Spock's body
with Mr. T's head.

45
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,816
"I pity the fool who's illogical."

46
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,684
I'm just gonna go home
and make a grilled cheese...

47
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,591
...and window-shop on eHarmony.

48
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,160
- Okay, bye.
- Okay.

49
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,929
<i>Ooh, look,
an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.</i>

50
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,596
And an Aquaman action figure.

51
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,106
Looks like someone drew a penis on him.

52
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,837
Eh. That'll come off.

53
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,518
You see what you're doing? Stop that.

54
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,559
- Fascinating.
- What?

55
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,698
<i>- It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
- Oh.</i>

56
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,026
It's even got the Elvish engraving on it.

57
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,361
It's not Elvish.

58
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,596
It's the language of Mordor
written in Elvish script.

59
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,103
"One ring to rule them all."

60
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,301
"One ring to find them."

61
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,913
"One ring to bring them all."

62
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,207
"And in the darkness, bind them."

63
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,718
Holy crap, are we nerdy.

64
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,883
So I was doing some checking
on the ring...

65
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,995
Hold on. Sheldon,
is there ketchup on that table?

66
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,996
Yes, there is. Oh, here's a fun fact.

67
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,566
Ketchup started out as a general term
for sauce...

68
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,068
...typically made of mushrooms
or fish brine with herbs and spices.

69
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,731
Some popular early main ingredients
included blueberry, anchovy...

70
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,242
...oyster, kidney bean and grape.

71
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,342
No, that's okay, I'll get it.

72
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,742
Listen, I was looking at the ring
and it seemed a little weird.

73
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,410
No copyright notice on it.

74
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,580
So I took it down to this buddy of mine
who deals with...

75
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,626
...shall we say, the seedy underbelly
of the collectibles world.

76
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,093
Seedy underbelly?

77
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,459
Uh, your black-market phasers...

78
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,863
...your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura
panties, that kind of stuff.

79
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,135
Who's this mysterious buddy
you suddenly have?

80
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,366
Just a guy. I know a guy.

81
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,034
- Is it Eddie Crispo?
- No, I can't tell you who it is.

82
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,773
- Who else could it be? It has to be.
- I know lots of dangerous people.

83
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,782
- Name one.
- Eddie Crispo.

84
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,483
Anyway, he said this isn't a replica.

85
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,281
It's the real deal.

86
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,790
If you're suggesting that
that is the actual ring of power...

87
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,156
...forged by Sauron in Mount Doom...

88
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,821
...I look at you with an expression
of exhaustion...

89
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,489
...and ever-so-slight amusement.

90
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,566
He's not saying it's a magic ring.

91
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,506
You're not, are you?

92
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,409
No, but it's close.

93
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,068
Look at the markings inside.

94
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,407
Those are production markings.

95
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,743
Nine rings were made
for use in the movies.

96
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:54,648
Three were given to members
of the cast. The rest were destroyed.

97
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,318
Except one.

98
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,322
One was stolen.

99
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:04,587
Gentlemen, this is the One Ring.

100
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,426
Mine.

101
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,835
No, it is not yours.
We all went in on the box together.

102
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,941
Yes, but I found it in the box.

103
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,441
And the laws of maritime salvage
clearly state...

104
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,706
...that the finder of a sunken treasure
is the owner.

105
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,713
How is this maritime salvage?

106
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,182
Other than the lack of water,
how is it not?

107
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,685
Wait, Sheldon.
Stop being crazy for a second.

108
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,853
How much is something like this worth?

109
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,356
Well, it's tough to say, since it's hot.

110
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,517
On the underground market,
my guy figures...

111
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,630
- Your guy Eddie Crispo?
- Yes.

112
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:45,867
<i>- He figures 10-, maybe 15,000.
- Okay, that's a lot of money.</i>

113
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,372
The wise thing to do
is invest it in something practical.

114
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,975
Like a Jet Ski.

115
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,043
Why do you want a Jet Ski?

116
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,377
All the wealthy and beautiful people
in movies ride Jet Skis.

117
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,041
- That can't just be a coincidence.
- Ugh.

118
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,553
We can't sell it. We have to keep it
and love it and polish it.

119
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,089
Take it out occasionally
when we go to the park...

120
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,387
...and reenact our favorite scenes
from the movies.

121
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,593
It's sad how great that sounds.

122
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,069
Guys, it's stolen.
It should go back to Peter Jackson.

123
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,831
- He made the movies. It belongs to him.
- Fine.

124
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,098
He can have it back.

125
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,573
As long as he promises to make me
a hobbit in his next movie.

126
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,405
But there are no Jewish hobbits.

127
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,447
Clearly, you've never been to my house
for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.

128
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,078
We are not blackmailing Peter...

129
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,848
- All right, where's the ring?
- You mean my ring?

130
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,184
- What are you doing?
- The ring was unguarded.

131
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,919
It was sitting on the table.
Anyone could've taken it.

132
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,461
Proof? I did.

133
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,757
Give me that.

134
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,924
Be reasonable. We want to do
different things with the ring.

135
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:52,265
But your ideas are stupid
and I want a Jet Ski.

136
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,600
I found it. The ring is mine.

137
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:58,266
I don't understand why in this group
I never get my way.

138
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,944
You always get your way.

139
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,780
I'll stipulate to that
if you give me the ring.

140
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,450
Hey. Enjoying your food
that I actually brought you...

141
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,287
...instead of promising food
but bringing you a box of random crap?

142
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,290
Yeah, it's delicious.
The sarcasm's a little stale, though.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,800
How about this? Until we figure out
what to do with the ring, Penny holds it.

144
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,461
- What ring?
- This ring.

145
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,569
Looking for something?

146
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,138
- Will you hold this for a couple of days?
- Why?

147
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:37,181
It's a prop from a movie
and we're kind of fighting over it.

148
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,852
The first piece of jewelry
my boyfriend gives me...

149
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,080
...is a prop from a movie
and I don't even get to keep it?

150
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,755
If you had gone out with me years ago...

151
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,859
...you'd have my Aunt Ida's brooch...

152
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,327
...that she smuggled
out of occupied Belgium in a cat.

153
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,925
How am I looking now?

154
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,261
You hit me!

155
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,101
I'm bleeding!

156
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,598
What was that?

157
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,741
Sheldon tried to take the ring
and I punched him.

158
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,669
That's my girl.

159
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:22,316
So, Sheldon, how's it feel
to get beaten up by a girl?

160
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,319
It's not the first time.

161
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,588
I have a twin sister
whose assaults began in utero.

162
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,126
If only I'd had the presence of mind
to reabsorb her.

163
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,962
I'd have a mole with hair in it...

164
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,265
...instead of a tedious
yearly Christmas letter.

165
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,474
Have you come to the realization...

166
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,305
...that the only reasonable action
is to sell the ring and divide the money?

167
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,376
- No.
- I was afraid of that.

168
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,207
Go ahead.

169
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,977
<i>Greetings from Mumbai.</i>

170
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,315
<i>I'm Raj's attorney,
Venkatesh Koothrappali.</i>

171
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,480
Also my cousin.

172
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,487
<i>- You brought a lawyer?
- Don't answer that.</i>

173
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,953
<i>I'll get straight to the point.</i>

174
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,031
<i>My client's prepared to surrender
any interest in the ring...</i>

175
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,668
<i>...in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.</i>

176
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,661
We're not giving him two Jet Skis.

177
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,673
<i>Look, we're big boys. Why don't we just
cut to the chase and meet In the middle?</i>

178
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,175
<i>One Kawasaki Jet Ski. Done and done.</i>

179
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,013
No Jet Skis.

180
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,546
<i>All right, forget the Jet Skis.</i>

181
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:30,712
Forget the Jet Skis? What happened to
"tear them a new one"?

182
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,587
<i>What can I say?
They played hardball. We lost.</i>

183
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,753
<i>- You're useless.
- I told you that when you hired me.</i>

184
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:42,329
<i>- I'm signing off now.
- Call your mother. She worries.</i>

185
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,872
So you know, if we're bringing
in cousins who are lawyers...

186
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,009
...prepare for shock and awe.

187
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,244
You know, I am ending this.
Penny didn't wanna hold the ring.

188
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,280
She gave it to me. I have it.
I'm sending it back.

189
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,345
- Where's the ring?
- You mean this ring?

190
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:05,451
Be aware of your surroundings
while urinating in a public men's room.

191
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,723
- Give me that.
- No, it's mine.

192
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,020
It's all of ours.

193
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,886
Okay, this is ridiculous.

194
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,965
- Then let go!
- I'm not. You let go.

195
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,591
I say this ring belongs to the last person
who can hold on.

196
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,732
Fine. Can't we go home and start?

197
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,272
Sure. Let go of the ring.

198
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,710
All right. It starts now.

199
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:33,815
You do realize there's a giant-bug movie
marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel.

200
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,635
Wait, my laptop.

201
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,912
Yeah, there's a point
when this becomes idiotic.

202
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,451
And it wasn't
when we were driving like this?

203
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,315
I would advise the three of you
that resistance is futile.

204
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,119
I have endless patience.

205
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:18,094
I spent two and a half hours on hold
with Hewlett-Packard customer service...

206
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,495
...just to complain
about their customer service.

207
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,970
You wanna talk about endless patience?

208
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,268
<i>Penny made me watch all five seasons
of Sex and the City.</i>

209
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,135
There's six seasons, dude.

210
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,543
Oh, crap.

211
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,147
No, no, no, the sixth season is great.

212
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:43,119
We go to Paris with Carrie
and get our heart broken...

213
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:47,020
...and then Mr. Big shows up.
We don't know if we can trust him again.

214
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,388
It's a wild ride.

215
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,989
Door.

216
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,668
Okay, everybody, and pli�.

217
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,307
And relev�.

218
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,020
What are you doing?

219
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,650
Last one holding the ring
decides its fate.

220
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,021
I know it sounds silly.

221
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,926
No, no, no. You are my boyfriend.
Nothing you do is silly to me.

222
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,923
Thank you.

223
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:32,538
FYI, this is a bag from Victoria's Secret.

224
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,672
I'm out.

225
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:55,285
I'm sorry, Ma,
I have to stay late at the office.

226
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,430
No, he doesn't. He's lying to you.

227
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,531
Will you be quiet?

228
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,396
Well, if you want privacy,
let go of the ring.

229
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,936
I'm so glad we came
to this gentile strip club.

230
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,902
Howard, here's more bacon
to tuck into the shiksa's G-string.

231
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,642
I'll call you back.

232
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:19,307
It's lovely you call your mommy
and let her know you're going to be late.

233
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,454
From what I know, if a woman
doesn't breast-feed on time...

234
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,420
...it's very uncomfortable for her boobies.

235
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,460
Don't you talk
about my mother's boobies.

236
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:32,064
If you're offended, let go of the ring
and go on home to your mother's boobies.

237
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,799
Excellent. Tire each other out.
The ring will be mine.

238
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,801
Howard, why don't you
go after Raj's mother?

239
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,599
Why don't we go after your mother?

240
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:46,267
Go ahead.
I have no illusions about my mother.

241
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:50,507
She is a kind, loving,
religiously fanatical right-wing Texan...

242
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,517
...with a slightly out-of-scale head
and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction.

243
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,120
Anything you'd like to add?

244
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,488
That's not gonna get you anywhere.
Better pull out the big gun.

245
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,960
You're right.
Let's talk about your grandmother.

246
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,621
No.

247
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,192
I call no meemaws.

248
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,627
Think about this.

249
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:15,137
The only way your mother was born
was your meemaw had sex.

250
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,977
- I don't wanna hear this.
- Then let go of the ring and walk away.

251
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,616
- Never.
- All right.

252
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,947
I'll bet your meemaw didn't just have sex
to have your mother...

253
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,553
...I bet she had sex...

254
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,314
...because she liked it.

255
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,325
- Stop it.
- Yeah. Meemaw did the nasty.

256
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,794
- I said stop it!
RAJESH & HOWARD: Ha-ha-ha.

257
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,990
- We're getting to him.
- Waterfalls.

258
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,493
- What?
- Waterfalls.

259
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,296
Crashing waves, babbling brooks.

260
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,498
- What are you doing?
- Subliminal messaging.

261
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,575
I'm going to make you want to pee.

262
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,646
Dripping faucets.

263
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,975
Leaky gutter.

264
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,980
Peeing.

265
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,175
It's not working, dude.

266
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,255
Oh-ho-ho. It's working, all right.

267
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,254
I have to pee.

268
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:11,026
- Then let go of the ring and go.
- Actually, I wouldn't mind going too. Heh.

269
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,695
Fine, um, on the count of three.

270
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,026
One, two...

271
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,533
Wait, just to clarify,
when you get to three...

272
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,366
...do we stand up or do we pee?

273
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,739
We stand up.

274
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,270
Excellent choice.

275
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,606
Three.

276
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:40,889
Oh. Something tells me this was a bad day
to wear suede shoes.

277
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,804
I've done it. I've won.

278
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,540
The ring is mine.

279
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,274
It's mine!

280
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:15,093
We're going to clean it up
and make it pretty.

281
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,393
My own, my love...

282
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,728
...my precious.

283
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,808
Where's the ring?

284
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:36,107
It's in a FedEx box on its way back
to where it came from.

285
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,274
The fires of Mount Doom?

286
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,115
Peter Jackson's office in New Zealand.
It wasn't ours.

287
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,917
You quit the game.
You had no right to take it.

288
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:49,619
You guys were sleeping. The ring was
on the floor. No one was touching it.

289
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,161
So we start the game over
until there's a winner.

290
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,492
There wasn't ever going to be a winner.

291
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,635
There was going to be a selfish person...

292
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,963
...and three people
who used to be his friend.

293
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,299
Is that what you guys want? If it is, fine.

294
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,942
I don't want anything to do with you.

295
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,439
I don't know what happened
in that bathroom, but I'm not cleaning it.

296
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,695
My precious.

297
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,548
I knew it.

298
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,518
- Give us the precious.
- Never! Never.

299
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,091
- Give it to me.
- Get off of me.

300
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,386
- Give me the ring.
- It's mine.

301
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,694
I gotta go back to dating dumb guys
from the gym.

302
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,493
- Give it back.
- Give it to me. Give me the ring!

303
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:06,195
- I said give it to me.
- It's mine!
