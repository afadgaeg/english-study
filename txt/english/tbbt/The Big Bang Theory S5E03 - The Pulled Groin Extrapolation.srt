- Ooh, me.

Penny, a moment.

3
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,550
We just had Thai food.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,512
In that culture, the last morsel
is called the krengjai piece.

00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,601
And it is reserved for the most important
and valued member of the group.

Thank you all for this high honor.

7
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,364
I've seen pictures of your mother.
Keep eating.

All right, honey, if we're gonna
make the movie, we should go.

- Wait.

Uh, which is closer
to the new train store in Monrovia?

19

Neither of them are close.

20
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,157
I guess it doesn't matter
which one of you drives me.

21
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,410
Let's play a fun guessing game
to see who gets to take me.

00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:23,290
All right. This four-letter word
describes either a printer's type size...

...or a compulsion to eat dirt.

- Okay, I'm not driving him.
- Penny, don't give up, you can get this.

Aren't you going with Sheldon?

No, I have no interest in model trains,
stores that sell them...

00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,476
...nor their heart-breaking clientele.

Oh, well, I have some work to do,

Okay. Wouldn't you be
more comfortable at home?

31
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,745
Not really, no.

32
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,250
Alrighty then.
I guess I'll just get started.

I've been told sometimes
I overstay my welcome.

43
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,212
What...? Who told you that?

44
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,466
Well, most recently, my gynecologist.

45
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,265
Oh, you stay as long as you'd like.

46
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,686
I'm glad to hear you say that
because I'm having a wonderful time.

Hmm. I said the same thing
to my gynecologist.

What are you gonna get
at the train store, Sheldon?

49
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,450
Oh, I'm not buying anything.

50
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,452
They're having a lecture.

"HO gage railroading.

Half the size of O gage,
but twice the fun."

53
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,586
It's a very controversial topic.

54
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,340
- Which side do you come down on?
- I'll let you know after tonight.

55
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,301
Unlike some people,
I'm going in with an open mind.

56
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,262
Who am I kidding?

57
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,431
Of course we all know
it's O gage or no gage.

58
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,519
Can you believe grown men
sit around and play with toy trains? Heh.

59
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,271
That's big talk...

60
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,899
...for a man with a closet full
of magic tricks at his mother's house.

61
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,113
First of all, they're not tricks.
They're illusions.

62
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,200
Secondly, when we get married,
they're all going up in the attic...

63
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,619
...so you can have that closet
for clothes.

64
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,622
Why would I keep clothes
at your mother's house?

65
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,165
Well, don't think of it that way.

66
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,376
Once we move in, it'll be our house.

67
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,919
Is she moving out?

68
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,880
Why would she move out?
It's her house.

Hang on. You seriously think
I'm gonna live with your mother?

Why not?
It's a great house, plenty of room.

If we have kids, Mom's there to help.

164
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,282
Amy, this is for you, heh.

165
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,661
When you're done copping a feel,
that goes on my wrist.

166
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:28,043
All aboard. Woo-woo!

167
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:33,256
It's official. I'm an HO trainiac.

168
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,553
So dinner went nice.

169
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,555
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

170
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,684
Does your mother always cut your meat
for you?

171
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,480
Only when it's fatty.

172
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,566
Well, don't be jealous, babe.

173
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,943
Someday, you'll get to cut it for me.

174
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,031
<font color="#808080">MRS. WOLOWITZ</font>: Bernadette,
I found the extra head for the Water Pik...

175
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,699
...if you wanna use it.

176
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,035
I'm okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.

177
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,706
<font color="#808080">MRS. WOLOWITZ</font>: You sure? I just squirted
half a brisket out of my teeth.

178
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,459
Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?

179
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,797
<font color="#808080">MRS. WOLOWITZ</font>:
Oh, I know what that means. Hubba-hubba.

- Relax, it'll be fine.

Let me know when you're done canoodling.

184
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,605
Do a little dance

185
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,399
Make a little love

186
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:36,277
Get down tonight

187
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,780

188
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,448
Make a little love

189
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,783
Get down tonight

190
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,243
Would you like to dance?

191
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,663
No, thank you.
I'm really not much of a dancer.

192
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,584
You're not exactly winning any trophies
as a conversationalist, either.

193
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,966
I'm sorry.
The bride and groom seem happy.

194
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,136
Why shouldn't they be?
They have a feverish night...

195
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,305
...of socially-approved copulation
ahead of them.

196
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,017
In some cultures,
we'd stand outside their room...

197
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,395
...cheering as they achieved orgasm.

198
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,983
That sounds like a late night,
and I have work in the morning, so...

199
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,571
Leonard, you may not have noticed,
but I am being a delight here.

200
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,324
You're not holding up your end
of the evening.

201
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,994
I'm sorry.
This wedding just reminds me...

202
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,456
...of my kind-of-sort-of girlfriend
9000 miles away.

203
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,417
I have a kind-of-sort-of boyfriend
playing with a model train right now.

204
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,003
You don't hear me bitching about it.

205
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,718
A word of advice.
Moody self-obsession is only attractive...

206
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,305
...in men who can play guitar
and are considerably taller than you.

207
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,308
I'm not moody, I'm fun.

208
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,186
Do you have any evidence
to support that statement?

209
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,063
Well, hey,
I'm just as much fun as you are.

210
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,441
Really?
Are you willing to draw a mustache...

211
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,402
...on your finger
as a conversational icebreaker?

212
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,321
I am.

213
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,910
Okay, fine. What do you suggest?

214
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,538
We just had a lovely meal.

215
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:14,167
The band is on fire.

216
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,046
And you're sitting next to a beautiful
woman wearing whorish makeup.

217
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,591
Why don't we head out on the floor...

218
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,427
...and see if I can sweat
through these dress shields?

219
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,388
Once again,
I'm really not much of a dancer.

220
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,100
Don't worry, I'll lead.

Thank you for reminding me
it's okay to have fun once in a while.

You're welcome.

255
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,224
Also for breaking the head
off the ice swan...

256
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,186
...so I could hold it
against my pulled groin.

257
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,688

Ames, hi. How was the wedding?

265
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:13,972
Great. Until I accidentally made
Leonard fall in love with me.

266
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,811
Come in, let's talk.

267
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,313
Do you want a glass of wine?

268
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,565
Wine is one of the reasons
I'm in this fix.

269
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,067
That and this dang pelvis.

270
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,030
Okay, I'm sorry,
what exactly happened?

271
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,784
The inevitable. He was lonely and
vulnerable from missing his girlfriend.

272
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,370
While I was charming, supportive,
and let's face it...

273
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,165
...in this dress, the perfect combination
of Madonna and whore.

274
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:46,254
- Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
- No, but it's only a matter of time.

275
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,715
How could I have not seen this coming?

276
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,051
Now I'm gonna have to break
the little sad sack's heart.

277
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,221
I'm sure he'll be okay.

278
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,181
Oh, Penny.
Much as I would treasure knowing...

279
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,350
...the two of us had been defiled
by the same man...

280
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,686
...Leonard just doesn't get
my motor running.

281
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,694
So, um, what are you gonna do?
Do you want me to talk to Leonard?

282
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,947
- Let him down easy.
- No. I'll let him have tonight.

283
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,116
I'll send him an e-mail...

284
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,286
...letting him know this body
is never gonna be his wonderland.

285
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,915
I mean, frankly, you've got a better shot
than he does.

286
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,720
Leonard, check it out.

287
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,889
I bought an N gage locomotive.

288
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,016
Half the size of HO.

289
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,435

290
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,938
Sounds like you had a great night.

291
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,066

292
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,610
- How was yours?
- Not bad.

293
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,279
I had a lot more fun with Amy
than I thought I would.

294
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,532
- What do you mean by that?
- It turns out she really knows...

295
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,285
...how to help a guy loosen up
and have a good time.

296
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,164
Although, truth be told,
my groin's a little worse for wear.

297
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,792
Ow!

298
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,172
- Why'd you do that?
- To send a message.

299
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,591
She is not for you.

300
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,177
- What?
- Not for you.

301
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,856

Yeah, I guess.

00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,465

00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,869
I don't need any butter.

317
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,080
If you want butter, I'll get you butter.

318
