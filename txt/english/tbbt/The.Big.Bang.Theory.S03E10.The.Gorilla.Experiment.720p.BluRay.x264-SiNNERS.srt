1
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,666
Hey, Leonard, check this out.

2
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,209
Leonard, she's doing it again.

3
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,839
I think it upsets Sheldon
when you play with the food.

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,009
No, it upsets Sheldon when she
willy-nilly takes it from the containers...

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,985
...without regard
for its equitable distribution.

6
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,182
This is essentially
why you have famine in India.

7
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,922
You want me to put it back?

8
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,560
- Leonard?
- It upsets Sheldon...

9
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,032
...when you play with the Sheldon.

10
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,940
What's up, my nerdizzles?

11
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,241
Raj, Sheldon, I want you
to meet my girlfriend, Bernadette.

12
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,776
- Hello.
- Leonard, Penny.

13
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:48,380
- You know my girlfriend, Bernadette.
- Yeah. Hey.

14
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,177
Bernadette,
say "fo'shizzle" to my nerdizzles.

15
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,777
I don't think I can.

16
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,849
I don't have Howard's street cred.

17
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,786
I hope it's all right, I told Bernadette
she could join us for dinner.

18
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:04,954
- Sure. The more, the merrier.
- No, that's a false equivalency.

19
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,531
More does not equal merry.

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,794
If there were 2000 people in this apartment,
would we be celebrating?

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,562
No, we'd be suffocating.

22
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,303
- Sheldon.
- Don't "Sheldon" me.

23
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,964
- We ordered for five people, not six.
- It's fine.

24
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,236
We'll put it on the table, family-style.

25
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,108
Oh, sure. Why don't we put our hands
behind our backs...

26
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,647
...have an old-fashioned
eating contest?

27
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,482
Relax. It'll be fine. Sit down, you guys.

28
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,379
- No.
- What?

29
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,288
Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.

30
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,759
- Why not?
- That's where Sheldon sits.

31
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,261
He can't sit somewhere else?

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,798
In the winter, that seat's close enough
to the radiator...

33
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,268
...so he's warm
yet not so close that he sweats.

34
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,737
In the summer,
it's in the path of a breeze...

35
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,773
...created by opening windows there.

36
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,344
It faces the television at an angle
that isn't direct so he can talk...

37
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,812
...yet not so wide
that the picture looks distorted.

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,180
Perhaps there's hope for you after all.

39
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,676
- I love your shoes.
- Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren't they?

40
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,549
- Where'd you get them?
- Shoes for Less.

41
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:40,055
- I've been meaning to go over there.
- Oh, great selection, great prices.

42
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:43,329
My mother was right. Hell is real.

43
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,333
Come on, Sheldon,
let the women-folk chat.

44
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,194
Women-folk?

45
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,702
Gals? Chicks?

46
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,069
Utero-Americans?

47
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,672
- Just eat your dinner.
- Don't take him too seriously.

48
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,305
A lot of what he says
is intended as humor.

49
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,910
Yeah, well,
I don't think it's very funny.

50
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:10,545
Me neither,
but he just lights up when I laugh.

51
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,525
Howard, never let her go.

52
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,197
Leonard, Howard says you're working on
fundamental tests...

53
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,700
- ...of quantum mechanics.
- I am. Are you interested in physics?

54
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,030
I find it fascinating.

55
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,203
If I hadn't gone into microbiology...

56
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:31,538
...I probably would have gone
into physics or ice dancing.

57
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,212
My tests of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum interference effect...

58
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,111
...have reached an interesting point.

59
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,716
We're testing phase shift
due to electric potential.

60
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,081
- That's amazing.
- Yes.

61
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,883
Leonard's work is nearly
as amazing as third graders...

62
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,255
...growing lima beans
in wet paper towels.

63
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,594
While I appreciate the "oh, snap".

64
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:55,064
...I'm uncomfortable having
your moist breath in my ear.

65
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,769
Are you going to try to set up
the voltages using tunnel junctions?

66
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:03,934
Yes, I am.

67
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,410
- Wanna see a simulation on my laptop?
- Oh, yeah. Show me.

68
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,980
In microbiology, the most exciting thing
I get to work with is yeast.

69
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,811
- Howard?
- Yeah?

70
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,582
Your shoes are delightful.

71
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,291
Where did you get them?

72
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,493
- What?
- Buzzinga. I don't care.

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,936
Ha-ha. Eat my dust,
racially stereotypical plumber.

74
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,474
That's not fair.
I got stuck behind a tree.

75
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,447
And a cow and a penguin.

76
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,990
Face it, dude, whether it's a real car
or a virtual cartoon car, you can't drive.

77
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,489
- Just need a little more practice.
- What you need is cheat codes...

78
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,028
...motor skills and a genie
who grants wishes...

79
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,826
...to little boys
who suck at "Mario Kart."

80
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,870
Sheldon,
can I talk to you for a second?

81
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,473
It's not about shoes, is it?

82
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,667
I don't think
I could go through that again.

83
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,472
- It's not about shoes.
- Then speak.

84
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,014
- Um, actually, can we do it in private?
- All right.

85
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,508
Go away.

86
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,187
I agree, it's rude,
but she asked for privacy.

87
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:28,991
Thanks, Raj.
Okay, so here's the thing.

88
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,563
I was wondering if you could
maybe teach me a little physics.

89
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,530
- A little physics?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,695
There's no such thing.
Physics encompasses the entire universe.

91
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,239
From quantum particles to supernovas.

92
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,535
From spinning electrons
to spinning galaxies.

93
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,839
Okay, cool,
I don't need the PBS special.

94
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,415
I wanna know enough
so I can talk to Leonard about his job.

95
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,745
Like Bernadette does.

96
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,887
- Why can't Leonard teach you?
- Because I wanna surprise him.

97
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,024
Can't you surprise him
in some other way?

98
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:02,218
For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully
taken aback if you clean your apartment.

99
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,357
Come on, Sheldon,
this is important to me.

100
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,523
This would be
a massive undertaking...

101
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,226
...and my time
is both limited and valuable.

102
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,735
You're sitting here
playing video games all day.

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,371
Okay, point.

104
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,705
What sort of foundation do you have?

105
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,109
Did you take any science classes
in school?

106
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,249
Sure. I did the one with the frogs.

107
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,116
The one with the frogs.

108
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:33,589
It was pretty cool. A lot of the girls
threw up. I gutted that thing like a deer.

109
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,593
No. I'm sorry, Penny. I don't think so.

110
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,561
Oh, come on, a smart guy like you?
It'll be a challenge.

111
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,531
You could make it like an experiment.

112
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,394
Interesting.

113
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:50,100
I suppose if someone could teach
sign language to Koko the gorilla...

114
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,143
...I could teach you
some rudimentary physics.

115
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:57,409
Great. It's a little insulting, but great.
I'll be Koko.

116
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,485
Mm. Not likely. Koko learned to understand
over 2000 words.

117
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,919
Not one of which
had anything to do with shoes.

118
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,156
Hey, fellas,
this is my girlfriend, Bernadette.

119
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,661
My girlfriend, Bernadette.

120
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,295
- Who are all those people?
- I have no idea.

121
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,760
- Hey, Leonard.
- Hi.

122
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,429
Look, it's Howard
and his girlfriend, Bernadette.

123
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,940
Thought I'd give the little woman
a tour of the old salt mines. Heh.

124
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:29,139
He doesn't mean salt mines.
He means where he works.

125
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,782
Yeah, no, I got it.

126
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,121
- So how's your experiment going?
- Terrific.

127
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,123
Getting the electron accelerator set up.
We should be ready day after tomorrow.

128
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,194
- Boy, I'd love to see that.
- You're welcome to come.

129
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,354
Really? That'd be great.

130
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,156
How exciting is that?

131
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,666
Like Hanukkah in July.

132
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,127
Do they have that?

133
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,841
- No.
- Oh, you got me again.

134
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,672
This isn't non-fat yogurt.
This is fatty-fat fat.

135
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,017
Excuse me.

136
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,155
- Could you grab me another napkin?
- Sure.

137
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,380
Thanks, honey.

138
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,818
All right. What is your deal?

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,149
Excuse me?

140
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,855
Inviting my girlfriend
to come see your electron accelerator?

141
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,522
Yeah, so?

142
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,327
Wow, you really are a piece of work.

143
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,496
It's not enough
you get the prom queen...

144
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,507
...you have to get the head
of the decorating committee too?

145
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,344
- What are you talking about?
- Look, don't play innocent with me.

146
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:39,213
I practically invented using
fancy lab equipment to seduce women.

147
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:44,688
- Has it ever worked?
- Not so far, but that's not the point.

148
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,383
Howard, relax.
I am not interested in your girlfriend.

149
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,656
I hope not,
because you don't wanna mess with me.

150
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,029
I'm crazy.

151
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,906
I believe you.

152
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,872
<i>Research journal, entry one.</i>

153
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,882
<i>I'm about to embark on one of the great
challenges of my scientific career:</i>

154
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,210
<i>teaching Renny physics.</i>

155
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,916
<i>I'm calling It Project Gorilla.</i>

156
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,259
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Come in. Take a seat.

157
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,696
<i>Subject has arrived.</i>

158
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,064
<i>I've extended a friendly,
casual greeting.</i>

159
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,636
Ready to get started?

160
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,467
One moment.

161
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,945
<i>Subject appears well-rested
and enthusiastic.</i>

162
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,448
<i>Apparently, ignorance Is bliss.</i>

163
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,256
All right, let us begin.

164
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,291
- Where's your notebook?
- Um, I don't have one.

165
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,793
How are you gonna take notes
without a notebook?

166
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,760
I have to take notes?

167
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,991
How else are you gonna study
for the tests?

168
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,795
- There's gonna be a test?
- Tests.

169
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:11,134
Here. It's college-ruled.
I hope that's not too intimidating.

170
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,812
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

171
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,143
Now, introduction to physics.

172
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,776
What is physics?

173
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,981
<i>Physics comes
from the ancient Greek word "physika."</i>

174
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,353
It's at this point
that you'll wanna start taking notes.

175
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,790
<i>Physika means the science
of natural things.</i>

176
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,870
And it is there in ancient Greece
that our story begins.

177
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,865
- Ancient Greece?
- Ah. If you have questions, raise your hand.

178
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,343
It's a warm summer evening,
circa 600 B.C.

179
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:51,382
You've finished your shopping
at the local market or agora.

180
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,156
And you look up at the night sky.

181
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,815
And there you notice
some of the stars seem to move...

182
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,658
<i>...so you name them planetes
or wanderer.</i>

183
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,164
Yes, Penny?

184
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,035
Does this have anything to do
with Leonard's work?

185
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:21,404
This is the beginning of a 2600-year
journey we're going to take together...

186
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,340
...from the ancient Greeks
through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr...

187
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,009
...to Erwin Schr�dinger...

188
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,680
...to the Dutch researchers
that Leonard is currently ripping off.

189
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,851
- Twenty-six hundred years?
- Yeah, give or take.

190
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:41,262
As I was saying, it's a warm summer
evening in ancient Greece...

191
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,062
- Yes, Penny.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

192
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:48,037
- Can't you hold it?
- Not for 2600 years.

193
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,279
<i>Project Gorilla, entry two.</i>

194
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,921
<i>I am exhausted.</i>

195
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,437
- Howard?
- Uh... Huh?

196
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,632
It unhooks in the front.

197
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,211
Oh, that explains a lot.

198
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:33,111
Howard, I'm home.

199
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,311
Of course.

200
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,820
Senior fitness was canceled.

201
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:41,222
It turns out you can forget
how to ride a bike.

202
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:47,322
I'm fine, but, oy,
did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.

203
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,395
That's great, Ma.

204
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,094
What's great
about an 80-year-old Armenian man...

205
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,900
...with half his chin scraped off?

206
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,476
- I guess I should go.
- No, don't move.

207
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,772
Hey, Ma,
can I have lamb stew for dinner?

208
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,644
Lamb stew?
I'd have to go to the supermarket.

209
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,344
Please? I got a real hankering.

210
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:15,121
Oh, I can't say no
to my little tushy-face.

211
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,124
- I'll be back soon.
- Thanks, Ma.

212
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,300
Do you want the
regular peas or the Le Sueur?

213
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,303
Always Le Sueur peas
with lamb stew.

214
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,170
You're right.
When you're right, you're right.

215
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,872
- What if they're out of the Le Sueur?
- Then get the regular!

216
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,008
All right. You don't have to yell.

217
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,722
Sorry about that.

218
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,526
- Let me just put that on vibrate.
- I'm already on vibrate.

219
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,389
Okay, now, that one I got.

220
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,625
Howard, did you say something
to Leonard about me?

221
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:58,828
What do you mean?

222
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:03,032
He says if I go see his experiment
tomorrow, it might weird you out.

223
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,506
Really? He said that?

224
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,712
- You're not jealous of Leonard, are you?
- Me? No.

225
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:12,180
I may have mentioned
that it's a little inappropriate...

226
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,344
...to be asking another man's girlfriend
to his experiment...

227
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,512
...without discussing it with said man.

228
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,488
I need to ask your permission
to hang out with Leonard?

229
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,257
I didn't say anything like that.
I said Leonard has to ask my permission.

230
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,836
Come on, I don't wanna eat lamb stew
with my mother.

231
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,764
Damn. Was this close on the bra.

232
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,544
Now, remember, Newton realized
that Aristotle was wrong...

233
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,274
...and force was not necessary
to maintain motion.

234
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,749
So let's plug in our 9.8 meters
per second squared...

235
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,219
...as A and we get force...
Earth gravity.

236
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,724
- -equals mass times
9.8 meters per second per second.

237
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:59,263
So we can see that MA equals MG
and what do we know from this?

238
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:08,464
Uh... We know that Newton
was a really smart cookie.

239
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,044
Oh, is that where Fig Newtons
come from?

240
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,079
No, Fig Newtons are named
after a small town in Massachusetts.

241
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,480
- No, don't write that down.
- Sorry.

242
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,218
Now, if MA equals MG...

243
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,448
- ...what does that imply?
- I don't know.

244
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,219
What...? But...?
How can you not know? I just told you.

245
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,124
Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

246
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,062
Hey, you don't have to be so mean.

247
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:38,135
I'm sorry. Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

248
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,469
No. You just suck at teaching.

249
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,839
Really? Of those two explanations,
which one seems the most likely?

250
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,479
Oh, God.

251
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:51,242
Sheldon, look, I'm trying to understand
but you're going too fast.

252
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,649
- Can you just back up a little bit?
- All right.

253
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:59,086
It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece...

254
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,748
Not that far back.

255
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:04,488
Okay, at what point
did you begin to feel lost?

256
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,633
I don't know. Where were we looking up
at the night sky?

257
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,859
- Greece.
- Damn it.

258
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,970
Look,
there's no need to get frustrated.

259
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,867
People learn at different rates.

260
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,704
Unlike objects falling in a vacuum,
which...?

261
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,709
MA equals MG...?

262
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,310
- Squared?
- No.

263
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,284
- Aristotle?
- No.

264
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,316
- Five?
- Oh!

265
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,956
Oh, then I don't know.

266
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,787
- Why are you crying?
- Because I'm stupid.

267
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,025
Well, that's no reason to cry.

268
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,236
No, one cries because one is sad.

269
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:50,137
For example, I cry because
others are stupid and it makes me sad.

270
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,669
Look, can we just please forget
about all this extra stuff...

271
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,475
...and can you just tell me
what Leonard does?

272
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,708
All right.

273
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,410
Leonard is attempting to learn...

274
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,181
...why subatomic particles
move the way they do.

275
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,752
Really? That's it?
Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.

276
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:12,159
It's not. That's why Leonard does it.

277
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,866
Okay, I just have one question.

278
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,561
What exactly are subatomic particles?

279
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,606
- A good question.
- Thank you.

280
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,903
And to answer it, we first must
ask ourselves, "What is physics?"

281
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,511
Oh, balls.

282
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,547
It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece.

283
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,546
Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.

284
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,014
What did I do now?

285
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,680
I was in bed with Bernadette
and you text-blocked me.

286
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,058
- What?
- Yeah, we were completely naked...

287
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,856
...and about to devour each other
when:

288
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,095
You text her that I have a problem
with her hanging with you.

289
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,396
You do have a problem with her
hanging out with me.

290
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,369
But that's not what you tell her.

291
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,474
- What was I to tell her?
- I don't know.

292
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:00,544
Something that doesn't make me
come off as a petty, jealous douche.

293
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,777
And what would that be?

294
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,583
Come on,
do I have to think of everything?

295
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,612
Hey, Leonard,
am I too late to see your experiment?

296
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,382
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

297
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,324
- What are you doing here?
- Same thing you're doing here.

298
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,488
- Came to see Leonard's experiment.
- No, you didn't.

299
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,634
You said Leonard's experiment
was stupid.

300
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,071
You told her my experiment
was stupid?

301
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,401
I was just repeating
what Sheldon said.

302
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:36,912
Look, let's not get off topic.
Bernadette, I need to apologize.

303
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,416
You know, I was wrong to tell you
who you should be friends with.

304
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:44,283
- Should I leave you two alone?
- No, Leonard, you should hear this.

305
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,255
Okay, good.
Because I wasn't really gonna go.

306
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,489
Look, I know I come off
as confident and worldly...

307
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,798
...but the truth is I'm not.

308
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,800
We're shocked.

309
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:04,003
Which is why I tend to feel threatened
by other guys.

310
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,942
Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.

311
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,511
But I now realize how foolish that is.

312
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,143
He had a panic attack once
when he got his head stuck in his sweater.

313
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,050
It was a full turtleneck.

314
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,694
- And why aren't you helping me?
- I don't know.

315
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:26,127
Maybe because I'm crazy?

316
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,460
Bernadette, please, I'm asking you
to give me another chance.

317
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:37,197
What do you think, Leonard?
Should I give him another chance?

318
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,174
It's up to you.
He didn't call your experiment stupid.

319
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,542
Come here, tushy-face.

320
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,020
Tushy-face.
That is going on Twitter right now.

321
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,552
Raj, you should've seen
Leonard's experiment.

322
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,824
The interference pattern was cool
when the electron beam was on.

323
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,164
I'm glad you enjoyed it. Most people
aren't that interested in what I do.

324
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,571
Actually, that's not true, Leonard.

325
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,943
I've been thinking that, given
the parameters of your experiment...

326
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:20,279
...the transport of electrons
through the nano-fabricated rings...

327
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:24,890
...is no different than the experiment
already conducted in the Netherlands.

328
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,918
Their observed phase shift in
the diffusing electrons inside the ring...

329
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,258
...already demonstrated
the electric analogue...

330
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,265
...of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum interference effect.

331
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,104
That's it. That's all I know.

332
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,406
