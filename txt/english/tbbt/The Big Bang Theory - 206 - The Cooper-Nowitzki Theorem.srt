1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,860
you are considering
going into experimental physics,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,460
my door is always open.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,800
Once again, I'm sorry

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,430
that the demonstration
didn't quite work out,

5
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,030
but now we know what happens
when you accidentally spill

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,600
Peach Snapple into
a helium neon laser.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,460
Short answer is... don't.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,560
And now to tell you about the
theoretical physics department

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,230
is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Dr. Cooper?

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,660
SHELDON:
Forget it.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,630
Excuse me.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,800
Sheldon, we both
agreed to do this.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,030
It's a waste
of time.

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,100
I might as well explain
the laws of thermodynamics

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,460
to a bunch
of labradoodles.

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,400
If you don't do this,

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,830
I won't take you
to the comic book store.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,930
Hello.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Nice work with
the laser, by the way.

21
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,860
Looking out at your
fresh young faces,

22
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,160
I remember when I too was
deciding my academic future

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,300
as a lowly graduate student.

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,760
Of course, I was 14.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,760
And I'd already achieved more
than most of you

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,130
could ever hope to,
despite my 9:00 bedtime.

27
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,360
Now, there may be one or two
of you in this room

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,530
who has what it takes to succeed
in theoretical physics.

29
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,530
Although, it's more likely
that you'll spend

30
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,400
your scientific careers teaching
fifth graders

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,030
how to make papier mache
volcanoes with baking soda lava.

32
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,630
Oh, good God.
In short--

33
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,460
any one who told you that you
would someday be able

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,630
to make any significant
contribution to physics,

35
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,830
played a cruel trick on you,
a cruel trick indeed.

36
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,760
Any questions?

37
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,800
Of course not.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,830
I weep for the future
of science.

39
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,030
<i>Now if you'll excuse me, the
latest issue of Batman is out.</i>

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Come, Leonard.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,660
Laser demonstration's looking
pretty good now, huh?

42
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:17,161
The Big Bang Theory S02E06 - The Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem

Transcript : YYETS

45
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,400
I love this time
of the year.

46
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,460
The leaves are turning,

47
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,430
there's a bracing chill
in the air.

48
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,300
Plus there's a whole new crop
of female grad students

49
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,330
about to put on just enough
winter weight

50
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,500
to make them needy
and vulnerable.

51
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,760
That's right, honey,
have another calzone.

52
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,460
Daddy can wait.

53
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,030
Isn't there a university policy

54
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,600
against dating
graduate students?

55
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
No, if you can talk to them,
you can ask them out.

56
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,000
Damn, there's always a catch.

57
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,100
Hey, guys.
Hey, Leslie.

58
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,300
So, dumbass, I heard you made
a grad student

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,630
throw up last night.

60
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,560
The truth can indeed be
a finger down the throat

61
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,900
of those unprepared to hear it.

62
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,060
But why should I cater
to second-rate minds?

63
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,030
Because first-rate minds
call you "dumbass"?

64
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,330
Oh, yeah? Well...

65
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,860
you're a mean person.

66
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,260
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper,

67
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,360
I'm Ramona Nowitzki.

68
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,100
I was at your talk
last night.

69
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,160
I think you're just brilliant.

70
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,560
That is the prevailing
opinion.

71
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,860
Oh, now I'm gonna throw up.

72
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,430
Howard Wolowitz,
department of engineering,

73
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,530
co-designer of the
International Space Station's

74
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,330
Liquid Waste Disposal System.

75
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,660
Ew.

76
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,430
Dr. Cooper, I've read
everything you've published.

77
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,800
I especially liked your paper
on grand unification

78
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
using string-network condensates

79
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,460
and wawondering
how you determined

80
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,830
that three-dimensional
string-nets provided

81
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,530
a unified picture of ferrnions

82
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,930
and gauge bosons?

83
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,400
Amazing, an intelligent
labradoodle.

84
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,160
Woof.

85
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,660
The fact is I'm quite
close to a breakthrough

86
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,360
in showing how neutrinos emerge
from a string-net condensate.

87
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,530
Oh, my God, that would
change the way we view

88
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,630
the entire physical universe.

89
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,400
It's what I do.

90
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,630
You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz
Liquid Waste Disposal System

91
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,830
is turning a few
heads as well.

92
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,830
Again, ew.

93
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,260
You know, I'd love to hear more

94
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,630
about how you intend
to add neutrinos.

95
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,860
Could we get a cup
of coffee sometime?

96
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,460
I don't drink coffee.

97
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,500
I do. I love me a cup of joe.

98
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,260
Well, it doesn't have
to be coffee.

99
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,400
How about dinner?

100
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,030
I do eat dinner.

101
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,560
Great. I know a terrific
little Italian place.

102
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,260
I never eat
in strange restaurants.

103
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,900
One runs the risk
of non-standard cutlery.

104
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,860
Excuse me?

105
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,930
Sheldon lives in fear
of the three-tined fork.

106
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,730
Three tines is not a fork.

107
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,460
Three tines is a trident.

108
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,700
Forks are for eating,

109
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,300
tridents are for
ruling the seven seas.

110
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,260
What if I brought food
to your place?

111
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,030
That would be acceptable.

112
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,960
On Mondays, I eat Thai food.

113
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,730
Mee krob and chicken sate

114
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,830
with extra peanut sauce
from Siam Palace.

115
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,060
You got it.

116
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,130
I already have your address.

117
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,630
What a nice girl.

118
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,760
Sheldon, do you have
any idea what just happened?

119
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,560
Yes. Apparently I'm getting
a free dinner.

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,930
Oh, yeah, no, this thing's
majorly out of order.

121
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,530
See? Sorry.

122
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,730
That's okay.

123
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,200
Guess I'm taking
the stairs.

124
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,300
Where you going?

125
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,460
4-A.

126
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,800
Oh, are you here
to see Leonard?

127
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,630
No, Dr. Cooper.

128
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,630
Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

129
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,360
We're having dinner.

130
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,630
Sheldon Cooper?

131
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,400
Tall, thin,

132
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,730
looks a little like
a giant praying mantis?

133
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,030
He is cute, isn't he?

134
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,430
Sheldon Cooper?

135
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,700
Hi, Leonard.

136
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,960
Hey, Ramona. Come on in.

137
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,630
Thanks. Where should
I put this?

138
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,030
Uh, the kitchen's fine.

139
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,160
Hey, what are you doing?

140
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,760
I need to see this.
Uh-huh.

141
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,700
The viewing area's
right over there.

142
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,330
Sheldon, your girl... date...
person... Ramona's here.

143
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,700
Oh, hello.

144
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,160
Oh, sorry I'm late.

145
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,560
I just got so caught up reading
the draft of your latest paper.

146
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,460
Did you enjoy
the humorous footnote

147
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,900
where I illustrate
mirror-symmetry

148
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,300
by likening it to the Flash
playing tennis with himself?

149
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,000
So funny.

150
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,030
But the idea that you might be
able to incorporate gravity,

151
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,830
I have to tell you, I found
it  physically exhilarating.

152
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,060
My hypotheses tend
to have that effect.

153
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,330
I'm sorry I didn't
bring enough

154
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,560
for your friends.

155
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,000
I assumed we were
going to be alone.

156
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,030
Oh, yeah.

157
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,160
No, we were just going.

158
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,760
To watch, right?

159
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,460
No, come on, now,
we're going out.

160
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, come on,
we'll be quiet.

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,700
Let's go, let's go.

162
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,360
Okay, you two.

163
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,060
Have a nice...

164
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,600
whatever this is.

165
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,660
Okay, you guys, look,

166
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,300
I know this is none
of my business,

167
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,960
but I just... I have to ask--

168
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,200
what's Sheldon's deal?

169
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
What do you mean "deal"?

170
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
You know, like what's his deal?

171
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,460
Is it girls...? Guys...?
Sock puppets...?

172
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,930
Honestly, we've been operating
under the assumption

173
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,230
that he has no deal.

174
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,230
Come on, everybody has a deal.

175
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,530
Not Sheldon.

176
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,530
Over the years, we've
formulated many theories

177
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,960
about how he might reproduce.

178
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,330
I'm an advocate
of mitosis.

179
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,160
I'm sorry?

180
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,000
I believe one day Sheldon
will eat an enormous amount

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,230
of Thai food and split
into two Sheldons.

182
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,200
On the other hand,
I think Sheldon

183
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,030
might be the larval form
of his species,

184
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,300
and someday he'll spin a cocoon
and emerge two months later

185
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,660
with moth wings
and an exoskeleton.

186
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,830
Okay, well, thanks
for the nightmares.

187
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,400
Hey, do you want to
hang out with us?

188
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,260
What are you guys gonna do?

189
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,700
Uh...

190
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,860
My mom's making
a brisket tonight.

191
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,660
The one with the
little onions? Mm...

192
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,930
Yeah, I'm busy, so...

193
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,800
Good night.

194
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,830
Her loss. Let's go.

195
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,760
Brisket party!

196
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,100
B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K...

197
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,500
To-the-E-to-the-T...

198
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,530
* Ooh...
Don't.

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,300
Hey, aren't you
having breakfast?

200
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,800
Yes.

201
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,460
Are you experimenting with
nutritional suppositories again?

202
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,030
Not in these pants.

203
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,000
So... how'd it go with
Ramona last night?

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,760
Oh, great.

205
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,700
She's smart, insightful

206
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,860
and she has a very unique way
of, you know, revering me.

207
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,100
Here's your spinach mushroom
omelet .

208
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,500
Thank you.

209
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,130
Did anyone touch it?

210
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,060
Gloves were worn
by everyone involved.

211
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,400
I was vigilant.

212
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,430
Ramona pointed out that I've
been wasting 20 minutes a day

213
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,500
standing on cafeteria lines.

214
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,930
Time which would be
better spent

215
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,800
tackling the great physics
problems of our day.

216
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,660
You don't tackle
the big issues, Ramona.

217
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
You fence with them.

218
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,060
En garde. Riposte.

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Touche.

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,430
Morning.

221
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,600
Hi, Leslie.

222
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,700
So, Sheldon,

223
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,360
I see you're
organizing your papers

224
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,630
for the Smithsonian Museum
of Dumbassery.

225
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,500
There won't be any room

226
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,930
until they get rid of the
permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.

227
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,830
Oh, good one.

228
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,330
I see you got a grad student
to fight your battles for you.

229
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,860
I'll let you keep
your lunch money today.

230
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,760
Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge
of a breakthrough.

231
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,830
If you're going to stay,

232
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,730
you'll have to be respectful
and quiet.

233
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,700
Wait for me.

234
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,030
So have you worked
out the neutrino issue?

235
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,230
Well, to paraphrase Mozart,

236
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,730
all the subatomic particles
are there.

237
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,900
I just have to put them
in the right order.

238
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,200
You're so witty.

239
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,260
Aren't I?

240
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,100
(knocking)

241
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,300
Hey, guys,
this package came for...

242
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,900
Dr. Cooper is working.

243
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,230
Yes, I'm close
to a breakthrough.

244
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,560
Ooh, it tickles!

245
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,530
Sorry.

246
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,100
Holy crap on a cracker.

247
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,230
Hey, Penny.

248
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,430
Hi. You probably don't want
to go in there.

249
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,930
Why?
What are they doing?

250
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,630
The only way I could explain it

251
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,260
would be in a therapist's office
with dolls.

252
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,330
Hoo-boy.

253
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,130
Dr. Cooper's working.

254
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,330
Yeah, I can see that.

255
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,460
<i>Sheldon, Halo night,
Koothrappali's. You coming?</i>

256
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,930
<i>Oh, yes, it's Halo night.</i>

257
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,660
Let me just dry my tootsies.

258
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,960
<i>You're not going to Halo night.</i>

259
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
Yes, I am.

260
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,160
<i>It's Wednesday.
Wednesday's Halo night.</i>

261
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,760
Didn't a great man once say,
"Science demands nothing less

262
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,830
"than the fervent and
unconditional dedication

263
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,400
of our entire lives"?

264
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,000
He did.

265
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,760
And who was that great man?

266
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,530
Me.

267
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,130
Sorry, Leonard.

268
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,660
Seriously? You're not coming?

269
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,300
You heard her.
How can I argue with me?

270
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,930
Okay, well, once again,
you guys have a good...

271
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,160
whatever this is.

272
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,200
Dr. Cooper, I have
to tell you

273
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,860
your friends are
holding you back.

274
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,300
I prefer to think of it
as "I'm pulling them forward."

275
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,160
<i>Halo night?</i>

276
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,400
A man with
your intellectual gifts

277
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,060
doesn't waste an evening
playing video games.

278
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,560
He does on Wednesdays.

279
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,930
Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.

280
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,760
He does want that.

281
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,660
Does a man with my
intellectual gifts

282
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,860
play paintball on weekends?

283
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,560
What do you think?

284
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,600
Drat.

285
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,530
Now shall we get back to work?

286
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,200
I suppose.

287
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,060
<i>Battlestar Galactica
comes on tonight.</i>

288
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,100
I guess I can wait for the DVD.

289
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,600
And then never ever watch it.

290
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,830
* You can be my Yoko Ono

291
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,000
* You can follow me
wherever I go *

292
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,060
* Be my, be my,
be my Yoko Ono, whoa-oa *

293
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,560
* Now that I'm far away

294
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,100
* It doesn't seem to me
to be such a pain *

295
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,800
* To have you hanging off
my ankle *

296
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,360
* Like some kind of ball
and chain *

297
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,830
* You can be my Yoko Ono

298
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,330
* You can follow me
wherever I go *

299
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:25,100
<i>* You can be my Yoko Ono
* Whoa-oa-oa *</i>

300
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,630
* You can follow me
wherever I go. *

301
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,530
(hushed):
Penny! Penny!

302
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,930
Penny!

303
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,400
Sheldon, honey,
I've told you,

304
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,560
it's a small apartment.

305
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,030
You only have to knock
one time.

306
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,200
Please, please, I don't have
a lot of time.

307
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,260
Look, Ramona finally dozed off,

308
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,960
and I need you to help me
get rid of her.

309
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,800
Get rid of her how?

310
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,100
I don't know,

311
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,230
but apparently I'm in
some kind of relationship,

312
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,300
and you seem to be an expert
at ending them.

313
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,160
Excuse me?

314
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,760
I see man after man leaving
this apartment never to return.

315
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,030
Okay, first of all,
it is not man after man.

316
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,100
Dr. Cooper?!
Hide me.

317
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,230
Hide you?

318
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,360
I formally request sanctuary.

319
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,100
Why aren't you working?

320
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,130
Um...

321
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,800
she distracted me.

322
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,630
I told you, Penny,
I don't have time
for your nonsense.

323
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,730
I have important things to do.

324
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,060
Oh, man.

325
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,360
I know what's going on here.

326
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,400
Really?

327
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,460
Well, then will you
explain it to me?

328
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,730
You're in love
with Dr. Cooper.

329
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,500
Uh, yeah, no, that's not it.

330
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,260
Don't try to deny it.

331
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,060
He's a remarkable man,

332
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,830
but you have
to let him go.

333
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,700
Oh, gee, okay.

334
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,800
I know it's hard, but he's
a gift to the whole world,

335
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,330
and we can't be selfish.

336
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,500
Yeah, he's a gift all right.

337
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,360
Sisters?

338
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,700
Uh, sure.

339
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,460
Sisters.

340
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,760
Holy crap on a cracker.

341
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,900
(rhythmic tapping on wall)

342
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,130
Sheldon?

343
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,430
(tapping stops)

344
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,830
(tapping resumes)

345
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,330
What are you doing?!

346
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,000
It's Morse code.

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,500
Why?

348
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,100
So we can communicate
through the wall.

349
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,060
<i>We are communicating
through the wall.</i>

350
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,200
Yes, but the communication
is not encrypted.

351
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,060
I don't know Morse code.

352
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,000
It's very simple.

353
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,730
This is A (taps)...

354
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,330
This is B (taps)...
This is C...

355
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,600
Sheldon, I'm not going
to learn Morse code

356
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,860
at 3:00 in the morning!

357
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,360
All right.

358
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Don't come in here, don't come
in here, don't come in here,

359
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,400
don't... Oh!

360
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,900
(sighs)

361
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,930
What's going on?

362
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,460
Shh!
Ramona's sleeping on the couch.

363
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,360
I know.
When is she going home?

364
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,900
Never.
That's the problem.

365
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,130
I need your help.

366
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,800
What are you talking about?

367
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,960
I'm invoking the Skynet clause
of our friendship agreement.

368
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,930
That only applies if you need me

369
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,730
to help you destroy
an artificial intelligence

370
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,500
you've created that's taking
over the Earth.

371
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,860
Come on! Don't nitpick!

372
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,830
Good night.

373
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,330
Shh. All right.

374
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,900
I'm invoking our
Body Snatchers clause.

375
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,930
The Body Snatchers clause
requires me

376
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,730
to help you destroy
someone we know

377
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,930
who's been replaced
with an alien pod.

378
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,560
Yes. She's in the
living room. Go.

379
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,630
I'll wait here.

380
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,300
Sheldon, what are you doing
out of bed?

381
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,700
Now! Do it!

382
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,160
You know you need your sleep

383
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,600
in order for your
cognitive processing

384
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,630
to perform at
optimum levels.
Now come on.

385
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,600
Godzilla clause?

386
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,700
Not unless she
destroys Tokyo.

387
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,000
Rats.

388
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,930
I've got it!

389
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,030
I finally reconciled

390
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,530
the black hole
information paradox

391
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,830
with my theory
of string-network
condensates!

392
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,560
RAMONA:
It's unbelievable!

393
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,260
It's paradigm-altering.

394
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,100
And I could not have done it
without you.

395
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,360
Oh, please, I just offered
a little encouragement.

396
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,860
It was a lot more than that.

397
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,260
You helped me work out the
masses of all the fermions

398
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,330
and you pumiced my hammer toe.

399
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,430
How can I ever repay you?

400
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,100
Well, would you consider naming
it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?

401
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,430
Who's Nowitzki?

402
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,630
I'm Nowitzki.

403
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,930
Oh, you want me to share credit?

404
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:41,900
Uh-huh.

405
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,360
Get out!

406
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,330
Oh, hey, hi.

407
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, bite me!

408
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,700
Sisters?

409
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,700
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper.

410
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,330
I'm Kathy O'Brien.

411
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,660
I just finished reading
your paper

412
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,930
reconciling the black hole
information paradox

413
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,260
with your theory of string-
network condensates,

414
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,100
and it just took
my breath away.

415
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,230
Maybe when I publish it,
I'll include an inhaler.

416
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,930
Would you possibly have any time
for me to pick your brain?

417
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,400
Let's see. Today's Thursday.

418
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,360
Thursday nights, I eat pizza
from Giacomo's.

419
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,860
Sausage, mushrooms,
light olives.

420
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,900
Great.
I'll bring it to your place.

421
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,660
I have the address.

422
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,630
What a nice girl.

423
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,900
Sheldon, do you see
what just happened here?

424
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,500
Yes, I'm getting a free pizza.

425
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,230
More pad Thai, please.

426
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,560
Sheldon, you've already had
four servings.

427
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,030
You might want to slow down
a bit, buddy.

428
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,230
Just one more bite.

429
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,730
Sheldon?

430
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,060
Sheldon, are you okay?

431
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,160
I'm just so... full.

432
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,400
(gasps)

433
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,830
That's it. No more Thai food.
