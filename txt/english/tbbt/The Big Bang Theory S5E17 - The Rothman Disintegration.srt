1
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,256
- It was a nice retirement party.
- I guess.

2
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:11,176
Still, it's a shame Professor Rothman
was forced to step down.

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,971
Well, what choice
did the university have? He snapped.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,099
It happens to theoretical physicists
all the time.

5
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,477
I wonder how long Sheldon's got.

6
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,480
These shrimp are all the same size.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,733
There's no logical order
to eat them in.

8
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,446
Can't be very long.

9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,532
Hey, look,
there's Rothman's empty office.

10
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,409
- Sad.
- Yeah.

11
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,703
- Indeed.
- So sad.

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,247
Dibs.

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,793
What's up, fellas?

14
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,795
What are you doing here, Kripke?

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,506
Measuring my new office for drapes.

16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,676
This is not your office.
It hasn't been assigned yet.

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,138
I called dibs at Christmas when
Rothman tried to have intercourse...

18
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,390
...with the Toys for Tots
collection box.

19
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,810
Dibs? I mean, this is a university,
not a playground.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,646
Offices are not assigned
because someone called dibs.

21
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,191
- You just called dibs.
- Shut it.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,653
Offices are assigned by seniority.
I arrived at the university first.

23
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,866
I arrived at the office first.
I'm the proverbial early bird.

24
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,535
- Gentlemen.
- Mr. Rothman.

25
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,038
- Professor Rothman.
- Professor Rothman.

26
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,875
Good evening.

27
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,044
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Good evening.
- See you.

28
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,632
I'm glad
that men are wearing hats again.

29
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,344
They're so distinguished.

30
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,999
- I got you a little something.
- A little something?

31
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,293
Oh, it...

32
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,256
What? This is huge.

33
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,424
What's huge is what you've done
for me.

34
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,593
Oh, no, Amy, I haven't done anything.

35
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,346
No, no. Before I met you,
I was a mousy wallflower.

36
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,597
But look at me now.

37
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,809
I'm like some kind
of downtown hipster party girl...

38
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,228
...with a posse, a boyfriend...

39
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,439
...and a new lace bra
that hooks in the front, of all things.

40
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,027
- Open it, open it.
- Okay.

41
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,164
I wanted to get you something
you didn't have.

42
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:52,212
Wow. I don't know what to s... Wow.

43
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:56,008
- Do you like it?
- Do I like it? Wow.

44
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,886
So where you gonna hang it?

45
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,930
Oh, my Go... Hang it. Wow. Um...

46
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,392
You know, I'd have to get a hook
and nails and a hammer, and...

47
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,894
- No problem.
- Oh, look.

48
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:11,273
You've got... You just...
You got it all right there. Wow.

49
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,865
I found him. He's in the bathroom.

50
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,534
- President Seibert?
- Can't this wait?

51
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,369
I'm sorry, we just need a word.

52
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,624
Now? You realize I'm your boss
and I am holding my penis.

53
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,335
Sheldon, give the man some privacy.

54
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,671
I'm sorry, this guy's got no respect
for boundaries.

55
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,840
What do you want?

56
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,093
Will you tell this lunatic
that Rothman's office is mine?

57
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,721
Take this up with your
department chairman.

58
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,098
His assistant said
he was on sabbatical.

59
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,102
Although, we distinctly heard
his office window open and shut.

60
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,189
Gentlemen, there's a task
I'm trying to accomplish here...

61
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,524
- ...and I'm having trouble doing it.
- Oh, my.

62
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,236
President Seibert,
I don't mean to be an alarmist...

63
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,613
...but difficulty initiating
a urine stream...

64
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,407
...could be a symptom
of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

65
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,411
If you're interested, I can send you a link
to a YouTube video...

66
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,915
...that'll show you
how to perform your own rectal exam.

67
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:14,336
Yeah, helpful hint:
Trim your nails first.

68
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,339
Ignore him, President Seibert.

69
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,176
I'm sure a young man such as yourself
has a perfectly healthy prostate.

70
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,679
Oh, he's just trying to butter you up.

71
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:28,267
And for the record, butter is an excellent
lubricant for your rectal exam.

72
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,186
Gentlemen, I'm going to allow you
to work this out...

73
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,522
...because, A,
you're brilliant scientists...

74
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,066
...and, B,
as far as who gets Rothman's office...

75
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,777
...I couldn't give the furry crack
of a rat's behind.

76
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,952
Well, as long as we're here,
I might as well take a leak.

77
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,291
- Kripke?
- Yes?

78
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,209
You're in my spot.

80
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,521
That is big.

81
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,940
So big.

82
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,609
- And ugly.
- So ugly.

83
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,112
What am I gonna do?

84
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,240
I don't know. You can't take it down.
You'll break her heart.

85
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,492
Look at that face.

86
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:32,539
That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.

87
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,793
Any chance I'll learn to love it?

88
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,589
That depends, do you like pictures
of yourself where you look like a man?

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,137
- All right. It's gotta go.
- What will you tell Amy?

90
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,266
How about I tell her the painting makes
you feel jealous because you're not in it?

91
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,603
Oh, nuh-uh. What if she gets me one?

92
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,107
I already have a picture of
me and Howard's mom...

93
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,611
...getting our hair cornrowed
in Venice Beach. I've suffered enough.

94
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,656
I could take it down and put it up when
she comes over, but it's kind of heavy.

95
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,744
Too bad you're not as strong
as the dude in the painting.

96
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,415
Would you look at this?

97
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,878
I paid $25 to some kid on eBay
for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand.

98
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,589
He sent me a stick.

99
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,220
He went into his backyard,
he picked up a stick.

100
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,723
It's numbered. Heh.

101
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,393
Ooh. Limited edition. Nice.

00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,688
- Oh, that'll be Kripke.
- What's he doing here?

104
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,775
We're going to work
this office situation out like gentlemen.

105
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,694
And if that doesn't work,
I'm going to poison his tea.

106
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,407
- Cooper.
- Kripke. Come in.

107
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,786
I'm making tea. Would you like a cup?

108
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,914
Am I wearing a summer frock?
No, I don't want tea.

109
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,376
Let's get down to brass tacks.

110
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,088
Fine. In the interest
of preserving our friendship...

111
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,090
- We're not friends.
- Well...

112
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,301
...that's a little hard to hear,
but all right.

113
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,848
As you know, the essence of diplomacy
is compromise.

114
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,600
With that in mind,
I propose the following.

115
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,311
I will take Rothman's office...

116
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,441
...and you will find a way
to be okay with that.

117
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:28,697
How about I take Rothman's office
and you go suck a lemon?

that cup of tea?

120
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:43,378
How about you decide this with
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock?

121
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,089
What the frig is that?

122

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock...

...was created by Internet pioneer
Sam Kass...

124
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,681
...as an improvement
on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.

125

How does it work?

128
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,646
Oh, it's very simple.

129
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,441
Scissors cuts paper,
paper covers rock...

130
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,319
...rock crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock...

131
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,655
...Spock smashes scissors,
scissors decapitates lizard...

132
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,533
...lizard eats paper,
paper disproves Spock...

133
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,494
...Spock vaporizes rock...

134
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,997
...and, as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.

135
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,961
I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

136
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,216
Well, of course.
Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock...

137
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,635
...rock crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock...

138
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,513
...Spock smashes scissors,

...and, as it always has,

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,607
Almost got it. One more time.

143
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,651
Scissors cuts paper,

He's screwing with you.

Is he?

146
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,618
Well, then,
seems we have reached an impasse.

147
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,913
I see no other option
than to challenge you to a duel.

148
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:04,167
I'd smack you with a glove, but just last
week, I packed away my winter things.

149
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,380
It's the 21st century,
you can't have a duel.

150
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,882
Hang on, Howard.

151
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,720
Barry, how good of a shot are you?

152
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,682
Not pistols. Minds.

...or model trains.

You have an advantage in trivia.
You have an eidetic memory.

158
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,826
Plus, I haven't watched Star Trek...

159

...since I discovered the strip club

- Sports.
- Sports.

- Don't bother.
- Oh, Amy, please.

00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,627
I'm so humiliated. I sat there the whole
time we were watching Grease...

250
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,171
- ...thinking you liked the painting.
- I know.

251
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,089

...to the last "rama lama lama

You're absolutely right.

254
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,973
I should have been honest
and told you the gift was too much.

255
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,102
Yes, too much. Because our friendship
is fundamentally asymmetrical.

256
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,230
I clearly like you
more than you like me.

257
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,567
I don't think you put a number
on how much one person likes another.

258
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,320
I bought you a painting
that's 12 square feet in area.

259
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,613
There's a number.

260

261
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:54,827

The painting set me back 3 grand.

262
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,996
Three gr...? Oh, my God.

263
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,418
Look, Amy, all you need to know
is you are my friend.

264
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,545
I don't wanna lose you out of my life.

265
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,091
I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble
believing you right now.

- Grab your hammer.
- No, damage is done.

Okay, look, I didn't wanna say this...

268
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,063
...but the real reason
I took the painting down...

269
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,483
...was because it made Bernadette
very jealous.

If you change your mind, all it
would take is some warm soapy water...

333
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,911
...and a couple of sponges.

334
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,332
- You're talking about the painting, right?
- Sure.

335
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,839

Help! Somebody, help!

336
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,677
What happened?

337
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,556
I was trying to see what was in here
and my head got stuck.

338
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,683
Why would you do that?

339
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,353

It's called scientific curiosity.

340
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,773
Now go get butter.

341
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,276
Okay, okay. Hang in there.
I'll be right back.
