No, the heat of the moment is,
"Oh, yeah, just like that."

- When?
- A week from Friday.

What? But we're getting married
that Sunday.

00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:33,824
You're right. I can't go to space.
I have to get married.

No one can say that's not a good reason.
I'll call them back.

- Have the wedding when you get back.
- Your dad's gonna be furious.

There's no way he's gonna let us
postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.

I'll talk to him.
He won't say no to his little girl.

No, I... l should talk to him,
you know, man-to-man.

15

All right, look, I'm gonna level with you.
I'm terrified about going into space.

61
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,443
No, it's because I live with my mom
and she makes me Froot Loops.

62
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,281
Go with gay story.
People are more accepting of that.

to get it back from you...

- Lt wasn't a real proposal.

you can squeeze us in?

See, I'm an astronaut
and I'm leaving for Russia on Sunday...

152
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,354
...so I can take a Soyuz rocket
to the international Space Station.

153
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,523

front of the line needs a maid of honor.

00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,376

"Get a dog, don't get a dog.

walking it.

160
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:02,559

to wait until Sunday morning...

180
