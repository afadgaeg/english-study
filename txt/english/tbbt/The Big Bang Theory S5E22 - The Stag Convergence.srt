00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,431
I wish you could all be inside my head.

3
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,642
The conversation is sparkling.

4
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,771
Fine, I'll tell you.

5
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:27,276
A lichen is an organism made up
of two separate species, fungi and algae.

6
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:31,905
If you could merge with another species,
what species would you pick and why?

7
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,324
Hint, there is a right answer.

8
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,327
None of you will get it.

9
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,624
Okay. Um, I'd pick swan
because, uh, the resulting hybrid...

10
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,878
...would have the advanced
industrial civilization of a human...

11
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,298
...and the long, graceful neck
I've always dreamed of having.

12
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,510
Wrong. Leonard?

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,056
Horse. But mostly just for the height.

14
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,059
A little bit for the genital girth.

15
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,772
Wrong. And let's keep it clean, shall we?

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,150
Kangaroo. Uh, I'd be a kangajew...

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,780
...the first of my people
to dunk a basketball.

18
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,910
Also, instead of just living in your mother's
house, you could live inside her body.

20
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,290
Clever, but also wrong.

21
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:27,544
No. The best organism for human beings
to merge with is the lichen itself.

22
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,839
That way you'd be
human, fungus and algae.

23
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,549
Triple threat.

24
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,343
Like three-bean salad.

25
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,930
Give me one circumstance
that would be useful.

26
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,141
All right, picture this.
A beautiful outdoor concert.

27
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,936
Now, as a human,
I appreciate Beethoven.

28
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,649
As a fungus, I have a terrific view
growing out of a towering maple tree.

29
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,027
And no thank you expensive concessions
because as an algae...

30
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,321
...I'll just snack on this sunlight.

31
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,950
- He got us again.
- No, he didn't.

32
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,830
Anyway, if it's okay with you,
we should talk about Howard's bachelor party.

33
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,417
Seems like a bit of a letdown
after our lichen conversation, but...

34
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,336
What do you know? You're half-swan.

35
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,631
I did some research on strippers.

36
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,092
One agency said
they can get us a great price...

37
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,679
...if we're flexible on age range
and number of limbs.

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,725
Sounds like loads of fun,
but I promised Bernadette no strippers.

39
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,854
Heh, you don't want strippers?
You're the king of strippers.

40
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,232
That one club in North Hollywood
named a pole after you.

41
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,401
What can I tell you?

42
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,612
- I'm not into that stuff anymore.
- Good. I'm proud of you.

43
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,199
You're the first of us to get married.
We have to do something special.

44
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,035
Germans have an interesting
pre-wedding custom...

45
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,413
it's probably not for me.

46
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,128
Maybe we can go up to, uh, Napa Valley.
They've got that wine train...

47
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,965
Boo, wine. But, yay, trains. I'm in.

48
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,010
Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year.

49
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,514
You travel through the vineyards, there's
a tasting on board, and all the wildflowers...

50
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,100
...are in bloom. It's magic.

51
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:10,647
Look at that. In 30 seconds,
we went from hiring women to being them.

52
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:42,221
So I hear you and the lost boys
are having a bachelor party tonight.

53
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,808
Yeah. Just going to a restaurant, get some
steaks, Scotch. Nothing to worry about.

54
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,227
Why should I worry?

55
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,939
It's a bachelor party. There could be
strippers. Wouldn't that make you jealous?

56
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,108
Uh, come on, Leonard, it's you.
What's gonna happen?

57
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,236
If there was a stripper, all you'd do...

58
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:01,740
...is avoid eye contact and maybe offer
to help her kid with his homework.

59
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,660
Hey, I'm a young man
in his sexual prime.

60
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:10,749
Under the right conditions,
I am capable of just really crazy stuff.

61
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,002
Really? What is the craziest thing
you've ever done with a woman?

62
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,505
The time we had sex in the ocean
does not count.

63
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,132
Oh, come on, that's gotta count.

64
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,511
There was a really strong undertow.
We could've died.

65
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,680
Well, have fun tonight.

66
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:29,810
Oh, I will. There is no telling
what might happen.

67
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,521
Yeah, there is, heh.

68
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:38,360
You know, there's nothing wrong helping
some woman's kid get through their SATs.

69
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,492
I gotta hand it to Raj. He found
a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.

70
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,205
It's not bad. Unless you compare it
to a train. And then it stinks.

71
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,668
- Are you drinking whiskey?
- Indeed.

72
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,006
If I'm to participate in the social convention
that is the stag night...

73
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,466
...then I must embrace
all its components...

74
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:06,430
...including tobacco, swear words
and, yes, alcohol.

75
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,559
Jeepers, that's yucky.

76
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,523
Whoa, it's a little early to start dropping
J-bombs, don't you think?

77
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,320
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey. Nice of you to make it out for Howard.

78
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,365
It was either this or another
hot tub party at George Takei's house.

79
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,535
I'm confused.
I thought since our reconciliation...

80
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,412
...I was your friend in this group.

81
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,664
- Oh, I'm friends with Howard too.
- Oh.

82
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,042
I guess you're just friends with anybody.

83
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,713
Agh!

84
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:45,177
Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight
at the comic book store.

85
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,347
I might need some help
covering my share of the check.

86
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,015
Oh, yeah. No worries.

87
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,934
- And maybe a few bucks for the valet.
- Oh, all right.

88
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,021
- And gas money to get home.
- Yeah, sure.

89
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,941
You know what,
this is my grandfather's watch...

90
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,360
- Oh.
- ...18-karat gold.

91
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,071
- Got it in Europe during the war.
- Wow, it's very nice.

92
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,782

"Are you gonna take Howard's name?"

00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,196
We were in the ocean
and we started making out.

163
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,034
I know, it was crazy.

164
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,537
I wasn't even wearing my aqua socks.

165
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,791
- Then...
- Nobody cares, Hofstadter, wrap it up.

166
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,044
Right. To Howard.

Okay, I'll go.

170
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:44,517
Howard, when I think about
you and Bernadette...

171
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,812
...starting this wonderful life together...

172
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,399
...I can't help but get a little choked up.
I mean...

- I'll go.

180
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,178
Howard, I'm gonna say something
to you that everybody is thinking...

181
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,555
...but no one has the courage
to say out loud.

182
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:28,103

the implication is there will be strippers.

Okay, when I first came to this country,
I didn't know how to behave...

191
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,051
...or how to dress, or what was cool.

192
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:05,640
I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard,
and suddenly my life changed...

193
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,768
...because we could be lonely together.

194

...to all the good times we had,
like, uh, when we went camping...

199
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,963
...and spent that night
telling each other all our secrets.

200
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,632
I told him I'm addicted to pedicures...

201
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,844

he lost his virginity to his cousin.

Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas...

to pretend she was Jewish...

00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,228
No.

326
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,355
Come here.

327
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,572
- I'm still really mad at you.
- I get that.

328
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,241
Anything else about your past
I should know?

329
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,038
Couple of things, but most of them
happened overseas. I'll tell you later.

330
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,374
Okay.

331
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,752
So is the wedding still on?

332
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,922
Yeah, the wedding's still on.

333
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,382

334
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,970
Thank God, I'm still a maid of honor.

335
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,599
Oh, what the hell?

336
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,061
<font color="#808080">AMY</font>:
This is kind of hot.

337
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,985
Hello.

338
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,363
What's with the robe?

339
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,910
I'm going to have sex with you right here
right now on that washing machine.

340
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,622
No, you're not.

341
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,500
Come on, please?

342
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,797
You wanna do something,
you can help me fold this sheet.

343
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,133
Folding a sheet in my underwear...

344
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,969
...still pretty crazy.
