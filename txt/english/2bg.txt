And... time!
37 minutes.

We got from the apartment to the subway
to the pastry school in record time.

I mean, I'm not wearing a bra and
my thong may be on backwards.

There's no wrong way to wear a thong,
as long as it's uncomfortable.

And with you,
the bra's just for decoration.

I have to wear one 'cause you get a ticket
for not putting the kids in a car seat.

See you in class, guys.
I gotta say good-bye to my wife.

- Did you think I was gonna kiss you?
- Yes!

I'm the wife, you're the husband, who
I caught wearing my clothes one day,

but I don't say anything about it...

- Morning, guys.
- Oh, hi, Bebe.

Surprised to see me, right?

Everyone always thinks I'm not
gonna make it through the night,

but here I am,
even surprised myself.

What's it like working
in an office

with someone who's about
to snap like a breadstick?

Not as much fun
as you'd think.

But Bebe's sweet, and working here
is putting you through pastry school.

- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

- I want a divorce.
- I already filed.

Season 3, Episode 11
"And the Life After Death"

Synced by dcdah & Reef


Hey, wife, I need $5 to pay
for a spatula I broke yesterday.

I was having
a Gordon Ramsay moment.

I'd have sex with him,
by the way.

Why? He'd just be yelling at you
and telling you you're doing it wrong.

Yeah, sex.

Take it.
It's in my purse.

Yo, Bebe, you got any extra
pills you're not taking?

No, I'm taking them all.

- Oh, my God, no.
- What? I just wanted one. Or two.

Just to take the edge off. I have
a whipped cream final at 3:00.

No. In the obituaries.
I know this person.

"Antonia Florentino, 80,
died peacefully in her sleep."

That's a suicide, right?

She was my nanny.

You still have a nanny?

Lucky...

She took care of me
most of my childhood.

- I loved her so much.
- So sorry...

That's kind of how I felt
about my old neighbor, Carla.

I mean, she didn't
take care of me,

but when I was a kid, she used
to let me drink out of her hose.

The last time I saw Antonia,
she was driving me

and a sloppy Nelly Furtado
to the Teen Choice Awards.

Oh, are we allowed to cry at work now?
'Cause I only do it in my car.

Max, you know what
I just realized?

This is the first time I've been here
since my nanny died.

You just said that
at Chipotle.

And then you said it again ten
minutes later, also at Chipotle.

Show some sensitivity. I was
crying because my nanny died.

And also because our
grief brunch was at Chipotle.

Caroline, your nanny passed?

My sympathies, sweetheart.
That's a shame.

But there is nothing better
than a black funeral.

I'm still hung over
from my grandpa's in '84.

Earl, my nanny was white.

Your nanny was white?
Child, you were rich.

Have you seen Han?

The funeral's in Philadelphia
tomorrow, and I need the day off.

Well, I think I saw him earlier, but
then again, it might have been a cat.

Hey, we both need the day off.
I'm going with you for moral support/

my first cheese steak/ I want to ride
the liberty bell like a wrecking ball.

I just read the craziest article
in this Popular Science

about white dwarfs,
black holes, and Uranus.

Oh, no.
Let me start over.

Han, we need tomorrow off. My nanny died.
She was like a mother to me.

But she was not your mother.
And diner rules clearly state

you can only take off for
the death of a family member.

Well, the rules also say
"No drinking on the job", but...

Okay, yes, you can go.

Because in my culture, it's important
to honor the elderly.

I shared a bunk bed with
a 97-year-old till I was 22.

Were you on
the top or the bottom?

Oh, I was always the bottom.

Oh, no.
Let me start over.

Hey, Caroline.

I got your nanny death text.

So I'm wearing black
out of respect.

And also, I got my period.

- Thanks, Sophie. That's lovely.
- It is? Which part?

You know, back in Poland
when my nanny died,

I was so heartbroken,
I could barely eat her.

You ate your dead nanny?

Well, a goat's a goat.
It doesn't matter what you name it.

It's still good goat meat.

All right,
I'll be in my booth.

I'm going to order a tuna melt
and three Midol, please.

Wait, how are
we gonna get there?

Oh, Bebe said she had a car,
we can just ask her.

I don't want to get
in a car with her.

I don't even want to get
in a conversation with her.

I can drive you.

We just have to stop
at my sister's

in Bucks County,
pick up an unmarked package,

and swing by Connecticut
to drop it off.

Oleg, is there anything illegal
about this delivery?

No, it's just some shoes...
Stuffed with cocaine.

Also the shoes are made
of hashish.

I'll call Bebe.

Okay, but I'm sitting in the back 'cause
I don't want the crazy to get on me.

Bebe, I can't thank you enough
for driving us to the funeral.

We're only going 20.
You can go faster if you want.

Yeah, we just got passed
by a tree.

And I'm especially thrilled
your nervous cocker spaniel

with gas and hot spots
got to join us.

Okay, now you're going 100.

We can go slower if you want.

Sorry. Extremes...
That's my thing.

One time I moved to Tokyo
for a day.

Max, it just hit me again.

I know. It's like
she feeds him broccoli.

No. That Antonia
is really dead.

Well, the good news is, according to
Yelp, she's dead about two blocks

from the famous Philly
cheese steak place.

- Max, show some respect.
- Well, I didn't know her.

In fact, I only know her as the lady who
brought me and cheese steaks together.

Even though we've never met,
it'll mean so much

to Antonia’s family
that I came out of respect.

It'll mean so much
to my therapist

that I left my safe zone and
only brought one of the dogs.

Max, do you think
in addition to my eulogy,

I should read something
from my childhood journal?

I don't, but I think you're
gonna do it anyway.

"Christmas morning, 1997.

"Antonia woke me up
with a cup of hot cocoa"

"and my favorite peppermint stick,
and then we opened presents."

Christmas morning, 1997.

I threw cold water
on my mother's face.

New Year's day...
Still no movement.

This is the only picture
I still have of us.

It was our first Halloween together.
I was four.

Look at that cute little baby
chick costume she made me.

- Aw, so cute.
- Car.

I never had
a Halloween costume.

I used to put my hair
in a messy bun

and stumble from door-to-door
telling people I was my mother.

This Halloween, I went
as my doctor, Michael.

And I dressed up my buddy
here as his lover, Joseph.

We lost.

Antonia was always there
for me...

Halloween, Christmas, Easter...
Every holiday.

Really, every day.

- She was really like a mother to me.
- Where was your real mother?

Hey, what kind of dog is that?
I mean, besides "sad"?

Her mother had an affair,
got pushed out.

That's her hot spot,
so don't lick it.

It's okay, Max,
I don't need any protection.

You don't need protection?

Who are you,
every guy I've ever dated?

Bebe, yes, my mother was unfaithful
to my father, so she was sent away.

But I had Antonia
and she took care of me.

She was my family.

That must have been hard.
Everybody needs a mother.

I'd be crazy
without my mother.

She drives me to
all my appointments.

But you drive.

Yeah...

But I'm not supposed to.

It's okay I asked Bebe
to wait in the car, right?

I mean, she'll be okay.
We cracked a window.

Yeah, and she's got
a bowl and a chew-toy.

Come on, let's sign in.

Max, I have to keep it together
when I meet the family.

I can't be all emotional.

Look, my hand's shaking.
This is terrible.

What? It was
a terrible signature.

And there were only five
other names on the page.

Get rid of it.

"Get rid of it"?

Who are you,
every guy I've ever dated?

"Caroline Channing."

Here, Max.

Oh, look.

The flowers and everything are
so beautiful.

There you go.

You signed
"Phil E. Cheese Steak"?

You told me not to mention it
anymore, so it's just a reminder.

Okay, Max, there are gonna
be a lot of people

who will want my attention,
so please be patient

and stand next to me for
the occasional supportive lean.

And if someone starts
to get too weepy,

push them out of the way because
I can't get tears on this dress.

It has to be back
to Barneys by 9:00 A.M.

- You're here.
- Here we go, Max.

I was talking to him.

Of course you were.
It's a very sad day for us all.

That was rough.

Oh. Max, look.
This is Antonia.

- Wow. She looks really nice.
- She was.

I didn't know
she was in the military.

But it does explain those
fabulous bed sheet corners.

Wait, you didn't know
your nanny was a marine?

That's too bad,
'cause I'd be all,

"Yo, other little rich kid!
My nanny can snap your neck."

Oh, look. There are
her sisters, Cecelia and Angela,

and there are
her nieces and nephews.

And there is not me anywhere.

You know, my picture must be
in the coffin with the other V.I.P.s.

If you're a V.I.P.,
can we get some bottle service?

Good afternoon, ladies.
I'm Anthony, Antonia’s nephew.

- It's sad day, huh?
- Yes, it is.

- Think I just got a little less sad.
- Oh! Anthony!

Stop. We're family.
I'm Caroline Channing.

You're Caroline "Hot,"
is all I know.

You ladies need cash envelopes
or you guys cool?

I always need
a cash envelope.

I'm sorry,
envelopes for what?

Well, at Italian wakes,
the mourners give the family

a donation after
they view the deceased.

So it's pay-per-view?

That was a good one.

Hey, you want to go get
a pop later?

We're leaving right after,
but yes, Anthony.

- Thank you. We'll take an envelope.
- All right.

The body's right
through there.

- Go right ahead.
- Anthony, stop.

I'm really nervous. I've never
seen a dead body before.

I've seen a bunch. A couple
of them were my fault.

I don't have any cash.
Do you have any money?

Let me check my wallet.

This is a real Ziploc,
not one of those knock-offs.

Make sure you seal the envelope,
so people think it's all quarters.

Max, we're next. I'm afraid.
Hold my hand.

Hold hands? What are we?
On a Christian mingle fifth date?

Please, Max.
I'm nervous.

- Oh, God.
- Thank you.

Okay. Now give it back.

What? That was just
my longest relationship.

Plus, I need it to put
this change in the envelope.

Oh, she looks so peaceful.

Hi, Antonia.
It's me, Caroline.

Should I kiss her? The family
is right there watching.

The lady before us
kissed her.

Go for it. Doesn't look
like she'd fight you.

Okay, on the count of three.

One, two...

No! Max, hold my hand again
while I...

What do we do?

Wait, leave it! We were
giving it to them anyway.

Not all of it.
That's our cheese steak money.

Leave it. Come on.

I am so, so sorry
about that.

My nerves got the best of me.
You understand.

- I'm Cecelia, Antonia’s...
- Sister. I know.

I see the resemblance.
I'm Caroline.

Caroline who?

Oh. Caroline Channing.

Caroline Channing who?

You're having a hard time
processing. Understandable.

It's been a very emotional day
for us all.

Who is this girl? You, I feel
like I've seen somewhere.

Are you Ricky's girl
from Rochester?

I could be.
What's in it for me?

Antonia used to take care
of me when I was little.

Oh, Antonia was
your baby-sitter.

Very nice of you to come.

Well, she was hardly
my "baby-sitter."

She took care of me
every day for ten years.

Caroline.
Caroline Channing.

I'm sorry, but I don't
know who you are, sweetheart,

though it seems to be
what you're hammering me about.

If you'll excuse me,
I need a cigarette.

And then I got to remove some
of those pennies off of my sister.

It's a coffin,
not a wishing well.

This funeral turned out
to be very depressing.

Well, yeah.

Dead body in the room,
generally a buzz-kill.

Unless it's an Irish wake... Then
you're playing beer pong off the coffin.

No, I mean, how is it possible
that the family doesn't know me?

Did Antonia never
even mention me?

Let's focus on the positive.
Anthony really liked your ass.

I know what
Antonia and I had.

This is what we had.

Peep, peep.
That's what we had.

Well, that's a lot.

But I guess no one
in this family

wants to admit that, and it's a shame
too, because I had a great eulogy.

You do?

Yes. I do. Would you like
me to share it with you?

I most certainly would.

You are not seriously eulogy-bombing
that old lady, are you?

She asked me about
my great eulogy.

She's a hundred. She probably thought
you said you had a great urologist.

Do you have a pen? I'm getting
the name of her doctor.

No, ma'am, I didn't say, "urologist."
I said, "eulogy." A great eulogy.

Why would you give
the eulogy?

Because I'm Caroline Channing.

- Who?
- Caroline Channing.

Caroline Channing...?
Antonia was my nanny.

My family was rich,

but then my father robbed everyone,
and we became the scourge of society,

overshadowed a little bit by Mel Gibson
hating the Jews that same week.

Surely, you remember?

Honey, I don't even remember
how I got here.

I can't believe this.

I constructed my entire
"happy" childhood

on the fact that even though my mom
left and apparently didn't love me,

Antonia did.

And now I get here and I realize
no one loved me, I was just a paycheck.

One of the many kids
she baby-sat.

I don't even know
why I bothered to come.

I'm gonna go to the restroom
and then we can just leave.

Excuse me. Hi.

Max, Ricky's girl.

I know this
is a hard time for you,

but it's a hard time
for my friend as well.

And even though
you never heard of her,

I was wondering if
you could just go over there,

and say you just
remembered her,

and that Antonia talked
about her all the time?

I know it's a 180 on your
original story and a lie,

and I'd offer to pay you
for your trouble,

but my 401k is laying in that box
on top of your sister.

Look, I only permitted
you two to stay

'cause your Ricky was so nice
to Uncle Joe

when he fell off the roof
last year.

But now, you gotta go.

Okay.
Be that way.

But don't expect Ricky to pick up
Uncle Joe for dialysis.

Max, what are you doing?

The family asked me to put it up.
They just remembered you.

Oh, my God.

I'm so pathetic, you have to put up
my picture to make me feel better?

In a way, yes.

It belongs up there.
Who wouldn't want to know that kid?

Nice to meet you, Antonia.
Please don't haunt us.

Now, let's hit the road and
get some freaking cheese steaks!

Max, please take that down.
It's so embarrassing.

Nobody here knows
anything about me.

They didn't know me either,
chicken.

Hey, who you callin' chicken?

Me. That was
Antonia’s nickname for me.

- You know who I am?
- Of course I do.

Antonia's little chick,
her peep.

She loved you.

And she loved making you
that costume.

Took the whole kitchen table up
with all those sequins,

but she knew you deserved
to sparkle.

She loved you so much,
I couldn't begin to complain.

I'm so sorry.
What was your name?

I'm Meg O'Hara.
I was her roommate.

And lover.

We were together 30 years.

The military!

I know, right?
I mean, come on.

That's me with my arm
around her on that tank.

And the family still
had no clue.

Vintage lez...
Very cool.

I know Toni would have
wanted you to have these.

Oh, thanks for coming,
chicken.

You're probably
the only person in the world

who loved her
as purely as I did.

Max, look.

Christmas.

And my birthday.

And the Teen Choice Awards.

I'm sorry for your loss.

Thank you.

Philly cheese steaks
for everybody!

And you really haven't
lived

until you've driven
two hours in a Chevy

with nine cheese steaks
and a gassy animal.

What? I ate mine
in the car.

Hey, Earl, you missed one hell
of a funeral. You should have come.

There were some hot
octogenarians,

and I got a definite "jungle fever"
vibe from one of them.

Girl, at my age, you don't go
anywhere near funerals.

You accidentally doze off,
you spend six hours

digging yourself
out of the ground.

Hey, how you holding up,
chicken?

I'm okay. Thanks.

And Max, when I die,

I don't care who else
is at my funeral,

as long as you're there.

Of course I'll be there. The murderer
always shows up to throw off the cops.

Also, save the money
on a casket

and just toss me in a hole
wearing Dior and a smoky eye.

Unless I'm fat...
Then burn me.

Well, I don't want
a funeral.

When I die, just shove
my corpse into a Cannon

and blow me directly
into the Trump Casino.

Synced by dcdah & Reef


One steak sandwich

and a cheeseburger
with muenster cheese.

We're out of muenster.

Oh, since when?

Well, let's see,
the diner opened in '82.

So '82.

Hi, sorry but we're
out of muenster.

Seriously, dude?

I wanted muenster.

Sorry, we have cheddar,
Swiss or American.

I hate cheddar
and Swiss blows.

Well... then American?

American cheese?

What am I,
at grade school?

Yeah, go to
the principal's office.

I can't have another idiot
up my ass right now.

It's at capacity.

Max, I got this.

Would you like to see
the menu again?

This is crap, okay,
I wanted muenster.

Well, I wanted to be
running a fortune 500 company

instead of waiting on a toxic
man-child like yourself.

But, we can't always
get what we want.

So, order something else,
put it in your pie hole

and get on
with your damn life.

Welcome to waitress.

We've been expecting you.

Here you go, table ten, Earl.

Have any exciting plans
for tomorrow?

Just trying to not
die in my sleep, Max.

How about you?

I'm going to visit
Caroline's horse.

He was adopted by
a rich white lady

who could give him everything
we couldn't afford to.

Which is everything.

White people will
adopt anything.

I figured out the best way
to go see Chestnut.

We take the J train to the 4,

the 4 to Grand Central,

change trains to Riverdale

No, but there's a dicey
underpass at Grand Central

where we might get shot.

I am so excited
to see my baby again.

Me too.

In the Lifetime movie version,

we get there
and Chestnut likes

his new home better
and then we cry.

Excuse me, Hi.

Sorry to bother you.

I'm Rhya,
I'm a little embarrassed.

I just got my period.

Mazel tov.

Do either of you
have a tampon?

Not me.

I just go off into
the woods and don't come out

until it's over.

I have one.

I'm so sorry
to bother you guys.

No problem, "Sisterhood of
the Traveling Panty Shields"

Actually, no,
I don't have one.

Here's a quarter,
there's a tampon machine

- in the ladies' room.
- Thanks.

Pick up, table six.

I couldn't help overhear.

I have tampon.

Oleg, why do you
have a tampon?

Same reason I carry a lighter,
even though I don't smoke.

Feels good to be the hero.

Sorry, again, but do you
have any more change?

It's 75 cents.

It's a quarter.

75.
Says so on the machine.

It better not or I'm about
to rage against the machine.

What?

Han, I need to see you
in here now.

But that is the ladies' room.

You're fine.

Women bring their little boys

in here all the time.

Everybody decent?

Man in the ladies' room.

I apologize for
personal intrusion.

You don't have to
cover your eyes.

It's a ladies' room,
not a solar eclipse.

Max, why do you want
to see me

in this inappropriate
meeting place?

This is why.
The tampon machine.

Oh, this is not man topic.

I do not wish to discuss
time of the month

when ladies must chase
the cotton mouse.

Chase the cotton mouse?

Geeze, where'd you get
your sex education?

Lambchop's playalong?

Han, you changed
the price of tampons?

Yes, this is not
appropriate talk.

No, this is not
appropriate action.

They've been
a quarter forever.

Look how old
this machine is.

Harriet Tubman used
to get her tampons here.

I'm a businessman.

Emphasis on the man.

I do not belong in here.

Hey, hey!

Don't make me chase you,
you little khaki mouse.

Look, han, everyone knows
there are certain things

that people need
in an emergency

that you never raise
the price on.

Things like what?

Off the top of my head,

tampons and 40-ounce beers.

Max, why are you so upset?

It is only
two more quarters.

Han, that's
a 200% price hike.

That's outrageous.

You're taking
advantage of women.

If men were the ones
who got periods,

tampons would be
thrown free

from floats
like Mardi Gras beads.

I went to
Mardi Gras once--I was 11.

My mom and her new boyfriend
wanted to go,

and they needed
a designated driver.

Earl, I need a man's opinion.

Is it my right
to raise the price

of any product in my diner?

What product
are we talking about?

Tampons.

Oh, brother.

Uh, you gotta just
relax and butt out.

Trust me.

I been in this
situation a long time.

Remember Aunt Flo?

That was my aunt.

Han, just because
you can take advantage

of a business situation,
doesn't mean you should.

It is law of
supply and demand.

Fine, then I demand you roll
back the price on the supply.

Come on han,
don't be so 1% about it.

You think occupy Wall Street
was a big deal?

Wait till you see occupy tampon.

We only protest once a month,

but it's an intense
five to seven days.

Got it.
Found the milk.

And I found it even faster
than the butter.

You know they're
not hiding it from you.

It's a grocery store,
not a sorority scavenger hunt.

Grocery shopping
is so fun.

When I was little,
I always wondered

where this stuff came from.

What's that?

Birthday card for my mom.

Aww, let me see.

"Get better soon"?

I thought you said
it was a birthday card.

It is, that's the
only one that seemed

appropriate for
our relationship.

Do you really
want your mom to get

a get well card
on her birthday?

Okay... here's one with
a strawberry, that's fine.

It's really about
the 50 bucks inside anyway.

That makes me sad.

Sad?
I can fix that.

Have a treat,
it'll perk you right back up.

Max, you just stabbed
a bag of candy.

That's okay, they'll
just think a gang

came through and did it.

A candy gang?

What,
like the sour patch kids?

Just step away and pretend
you didn't do it.

That's what you do.

We just need
to grab ten boxes

of Duncan Hines cake mix
and we're done.

Why would
we need to do that?

Why do you think?
To make the cupcakes.

I thought the cupcakes
were homemade.

They are,
I make them in my home.

You've been using
a boxed cake mix?

Relax, I only use it
when I'm tired.

And I add a secret ingredient
of my own to the mix

that makes them irresistible.

So you have no shame
using the store-bought mix?

I've no shame about anything.
Shame is overrated like Ke$ha.

In fact, they should rename
shame "keshame"

I just bought a Ke$ha album,
I'm so keshamed.

Shouldn't there be
someone to do this for us?

Oh, he's probably in the aisle

cleaning up after
the candy gang.

There was no candy gang
in here tonight.

That was a sneaky customer,
now wasn't it?

Hey, look.

For Chestnut, I can't wait.

I got him the kind with tops
on them, like Bugs Bunny.

He'll be so excited when he
sees the two of us tomorrow.

I know.

I was talking about
me and the carrots.

All right now,
your total is $70.49.

Wow, that seems like a lot.

I don't make the prices,
now do I?

No, I was just commenting.

Well, it's not CNN,
now is it?

- Here, give her the coupons.
- The coupons?

Yeah, here.

Max, you use coupons?

I had no idea.

You're looking at me like
I'm on To Catch a Predator.

We don't need to use those,
I have my tip money right here.

What are you talking about,
I have coupons.

Here, take them.

I-I have--

I can't, I don't want to.

I've fallen so far,
I can't fall any further.

Don't make me.

There's no need to go
down a keshame spiral.

Hi, she has coupons.

Oh, now you tell me
you have coupons?

Should have told me before,
now shouldn't ya?

I didn't wanna tell you
at all, she made me.

Now didn't ya?

Look, it's not a big deal.

Lots of people use coupons.

Coupons are for--

Poor people, yes.

Like us.

People who stand
at the cash register

and say things like,

"Wow, $70?
That seems like a lot."

Your new total is $12.70

wait, it just went
from $70 to $12?

Just like that?

The same food for less money?

The exact same food?

How is that even possible?

You used coupons,
now didn't ya.

Max, coupons are genius.

I'm late, I know.

I just got a text
from Chestnut.

"Where are you?

I'm wearing my best suit."

He spelled suit with a four, but
that's pretty good for a horse.

I have a good reason.

15 chicken pot pies.

Regular price: $1.47.

Coupon price: Free!

'Cause I bought 15
and used

the double coupon
in-store sale combo.

Listen to me with
the lingo already.

Reminds me of my first day
interning on Wall Street.

Chicken pot pies?

You don't even like them.

What does it matter
if I like them or not?

They were free.

It's free money.

Who doesn't like free money?

I don't know
about free money,

but this is like
watching someone

free base for the first time.

Chestnut's fine.

It's not a big deal.

Ooh, oh, I just got
another text from Chestnut.

"I'm so lonely,
I just tried smoking."

We can go tomorrow.

In the Lifetime
movie version,

we just missed the day we
were appointed by the court,

and Chestnut's new parents
move him out of town.

And we cry.

I get it, it's just that
after last night,

I woke up fascinated by
the concept of coupons.

So I did some research.

I found this woman online

who calls herself
the Williamsburg Coupon Queen.

Only she calls them
"cue-pons."

Is that the correct way
to pronounce it?

Eh, I'm gonna go with her way

after all, she is the queen.

Canned pumpkin?

Ten cans, double coupon,
five cents each.

Great, 'cause I'm always lying
in bed at night

thinking I wish I could crack
open a can of pumpkin.

Oh, and I found a coupon
for you to send your mom an

edible arrangement
for her birthday.

A pretty pineapple daisy says so
much more than cash in a card.

And it's for 40% off
the regular price.

That's perfect because my mom
was 40% off a regular mom.

And Max, I do have something
else for you in this bag.

Something that'll
make you very happy.

Canned yams for when I get
tired of canned pumpkin?

Better, look.

Look out, Han Lee.

I'm about to get my tamp on.

Well well, if it isn't
everything that's wrong

with the current economy,
in a boys' v-neck sweater.

Oh, what do you
think you are doing?

Oh, just putting straws
in the container...

in case, uh...

Just in case a woman might
suddenly need a straw

and not have 75 cents.

Those are not straws.

They do not belong in public.

Didn't your mother
ever teach you

that is secret, no-no
private lady thing?

You can't even say the name.

Come on Wall Street,
if you can sell it,

you should be able to bring
yourself to say it.

I will never speak of it.

Just say it.
Tampon, tampon, tampon.

What's the big deal?

In Ukraine, there are
pop songs about it.

She's so pretty,
she's so grouchy.

That is inappropriate
counter display.

You take it down.

You take down
the price and I will.

No, it is free market.

I charge what I want.

I am the boss.

Max, someone left a stack of
newspapers filled with cue-pons,

and look, a double
for Duncan Hines.

Could this day get
any better?

Oh, and tables four, seven and
eight want their checks.

Okay.

Have 'em ready right here.

Max, no, that is private!

Here's your check.

And a little something extra,

compliments of women without
three quarters everywhere.

Thank you very much.

I don't know
about your flow,

so I gave you a regular
and a super.

Max, have you no shame?

Nope.

Ladies, at that
time of the month,

I invite
you to think of this man.

This man, Han Lee,
right over here.

The man who thinks your menses
should be more expenses.

Okay, okay,
I will lower the price

back to a quarter.

And that is end
of discussion, period.

Oh.

Tampons for everyone.

Max, you are the Norma Rae
of feminine hygiene.

It's so windy.

Choosing coupon shopping over
going to see your son again?

That's a keshame.

In the Lifetime
movie version,

this is where they take
you away as an unfit mother.

And I don't cry.

I'm sorry, but I just saw

that all these cake mix cue-pons
expire today.

I'll be real quick.

Ten minutes, in and out.

If I had a cue-pon
for every time

I heard that from a guy.

Here, start going
through these papers

and look for
the cake mix double cue-pon.

If I combine these
with the in-store bonus,

not only will we get
the lower cue-pon mix price,

but they will actually
give us $23 back!

I'll give you $24
to stop saying cue-pon.

Come on, start pulling out
the ones for the cake mix.

It'll be a breeze.

No, that was a breeze.

My cue-pons!

The fact that you're more
worried about your coupons

than your hair
shows how far you've fallen.

Oh, my God,
I can't believe it.

Max, it's the Williamsburg
cue-pon queen.

Where'd she leave her crown,
in the minivan?

This is so exciting.
I have to go pay my respects.

We don't have
time for this.

Just throw the cake mix
into the cart

or we'll miss the train.

There, calm down,
have a treat.

I'll be right back.

Excuse me, your highness,

but aren't you
the cue-pon queen?

Mm-hmm.

I'm Caroline.

Freddie, and I can't
talk right now

because if I lose my place--

- you'll lose your mind!
- I'm gonna lose... my... mind...

I know.
You say that on your show.

I won't bother you,
but I think you'll be excited

when I tell you that
it's only my second day

and I already learned

how to make money
on the purchase of cake mix.

All I have to do is buy 40 boxes
and we get the--

Store bonus, yeah.

Cake mix...
That's a rare cue-pon.

Where'd you find it?

Yesterday's circulars.

Didn't you see it?

I missed it.

Go to the truck and get the
stockpile of circulars.

Look at him go.

You're sweeping
the shelves.

On your show, you said sweeping
the shelves was out of line.

Max!

These are mine,
I was here first.

I think she's probably
gonna be here last,

so let's go,
we don't need these.

We do, if we
don't get 40 boxes,

they won't be free.

I've met actual queens and
this isn't royal behavior.

Max, she just body-checked me.

Push me again and I will report
you to the American embassy.

Max, get in here.

Oh, we got a problem?

Oh, we got a problem.

Oh, hell no!

What do we do?

You step away
and pretend you didn't do it.

That's what you do.

24, 25--

You're making me wait,
now aren't ya?

Just till I get to 40.

26, 27, 28.

Come on,
I'll buy it for you.

Come on, take up
the bitch on his offer

and let's go see Chestnut.

Max, shh, I'm counting.

If we don't have the exact
right mix-to-coupon ratio

we won't get our free money.

Okay, where was I?

Amateur.

Real mature, your highness.

We have places to go.

Okay, 40.

Take it away, Tanya.

Wait, what is this?

This isn't Duncan Hines,
it's Pillsbury.

Where did this come from?

I put it in.

You can't do that.

It has to be all Duncan Hines.

I needed Pillsbury.

Well, you can't have it.

- I need it!
- Why?

- I need it!
- Why?

That's the secret ingredient.

I throw a spoon of Pillsbury

in the Duncan Hines.

Pillsbury?

That's what makes it you?

That's what makes
it more delicious.

Tanya, stop,
flag on the play.

Here, take this back

and get me another.

You know what,
I'm just gonna go

see Chestnut while
I still have time.

No, Max, please take this back
and get me another one.

You're the one
who wanted to use

the store-bought mix instead
of making your own from scratch.

So go back and
get me another mix.

I used the mix because
I don't know how to make my own.

No one ever taught me.

No one taught me how to bake.

No one taught me
how to use tampons.

No one taught me anything.

You still think I should
send my mom a better gift?

And no one taught you
how to check out, either.

I'm going.

Max.

You need to get another mix,
now don't ya?

I'll go get it,
won't take a minute.

Who's the queen now?

Hey, my dude.

Look at you
and your fancy coat.

Retirement looks good on you.

Told you I'd come by
to see you.

Hooked you up
with some carrots.

Bugs Bunny status,
like I know you like.

I, uh, I don't know
if you got my text.

Probably not a great
signal in here, but...

your mom might
be a little late.

She's coming though 'cause I
know she's dying to see you.

All right, man,
who am I kidding?

She's not coming.

I know that's hard to hear,

and trust me,
mothers not showing up,

I've been there.

But, I know wherever she is,

she is
thinking of you.

Okay, that's not true either.

Here's the thing.

Your mom is a flake.

And you got two options,

you can sit around
feeling sorry for yourself

or you can say,
"hey, my mom's not here.

"I can watch tv all day
and then go kick in

a neighbor's window
because I feel like it."

Hey.

Hey, look at me.

The fact that she's
not here is not your fault.

It's hers.

There, I just saved you, like,

14 inappropriate
sexual encounters.

Hi.

Hey.

Hi, Chestnut!

Hi, baby.

Aw...

I missed you.

I missed you so much.

Did you miss me?

So you got
all the cake mix?

Yes, plus the $23.

And I got you your
Pillsbury as well.

Paid full price--
it killed me.

You are a freak
with the coupons.

I know.

I don't know
what came over me.

When I found a way
to make free money

I forgot about everyone else.

Oh, my God.

Like my father.

Max, I have Ponzi DNA.

Yeah, cou-Ponzi DNA.

Must have been hard learning
to do everything on your own.

I mean, I don't know how to
do any of that stuff either,

but, I had a staff of 20.

Yeah, I got staph at 20.

You know, you may think
your secret ingredient

is a spoonful of Pillsbury,

but it's not.

It's you.

It's everything
you've been through

that makes you who you are.

Someone who fights
for a box of tampons

and fights for
a horse's feelings

and even fights
for a box of cake mix

when a friend in the middle of a
cue-Ponzi panic, asks her to.

This is the part in the
lifetime movie version

where I get up to pee.

I don't know who
you're kidding.

You watch the entire movie
and then you cry.

Listen to her, Chestnut.

She thinks she has me
all figured out.

What she doesn't know is that
when it comes to the cupcakes,

I have another secret,
secret ingredient.

Oh, don't tell me it's
a pinch of Betty Crocker.

I can't tell you.
It's a secret ingredient.

Okay, it's chocolate
methamphetamine.

No, it's true.

Our slogan should be:

They're so good,

you'll rob your grandmother.

Sandwich, burger.

Why the big smile, Han?

You going commando
under those corduroys?

No, Max, I am happy today
because diner clientele

has finally changed for the better.

Look, two parties of cool hipsters

are sitting at tables near wall.

You think those are six hipsters?

Okay, let's go over
this one more time.

Hipster or homeless pop quiz, ready?

- Ready.
- Hipsters wear?

Skinny jeans.

- Homeless wear?
- Dirty jeans.

- Hipsters listen to?
- Radiohead.

- Homeless listen to?
- The voices in their head.

- Hipsters have?
- Beard and a blog.

- Homeless have?
- Beard and so much sadness.

I see sadness, there and there.

I'll handle this.

I told you before,
I don't want you kind in here.

Take a trendy hike.

Better step it up.
The apple store closes at ten.

Max, why did you
kick out the hipsters?

'Cause I could not
be in the background

of another Instagram photo.

Here's the last check, Earl.

And, Max, they stiffed us on the tip

but they forgot their camera.

Oh, I'll give it to Oleg.

He can take one of
his special pictures.

That way, when they
come back to get it,

everyone will have been stiffed.

Well, good night, ladies.

I gotta get home
before the snow starts.

It's not gonna snow, Earl,
it's 50 degrees.

Oh, it's gonna snow, trust me.

I couldn't tell
when my first wife was coming,

but I can sure tell
when a storm is coming.

All right, so what's the plan?

What are we gonna do if it does snow?

Opening my balcony doors
and watching it fall

like fresh white linen and
then running across the street

to the park to make snow angels.

Yeah, that's snow when you're rich.

The only snow angels
you'll see this year

are the six crack addicts
frozen to our stoop.

Oh, not to mention
the adorable frozen horse

we have illegally
living in the backyard.

Max, don't overreact.

Chestnut's fine.

It's not gonna snow for weeks.

All right, have it your way.

But I wouldn't want
to be the next tenants

who have to figure out
why a pissed off horse

is haunting a Brooklyn apartment.

I was cold and she thought
she knew weather patterns.

Oleg, take a picture of your
junk on this customer's camera.

Done.

Aren't you gonna ask why?

No need.

I just saw Oleg's...

Yeah, that might have been my fault.

Kind of a shock seeing it
for the first time.

Max, I don't like you implying

that I would ever
be cruel to Chestnut.

I'm not implying it.

I'm saying it outright.

It's winter.

And it's not like
I've not been thinking about it.

But Chestnut belongs
in a special home.

You belong in a special home.

I've done some research,

and I found a retreat
in the Grand Tetons

where newly-divorced women
come to hug horses

to help them gain back
their ability to trust.

The only Grand Tetons
Chestnut trusts are mine.

Lady, you gotta get
a reality check real quick

'cause Earl thinks it's gonna snow.

Earl also thinks the theme from shaft

was stolen from a cassette tape
he sent out in 1975.

Shut your mouth.
That happened.

Max, it's not gonna snow.

I know snow.

We owned a ski chalet
in Saas-Fee Switzerland

and I think I know more than
anyone in this restaurant

about living in cold climes.

Snow is coming.

Yo, Swiss miss, you wanna have
a conversation about cold climes

with Snowleg over there?

Oh, Max, I almost forgot.

The camera.

I think you'll be very pleased.

I made a little video as well.

Why are you wearing two coats?

Same reason I wear two condoms.

In case one breaks.

What the?

Well, good morning,
world's worst weather girl.

I have never seen so much sunshine.

You know what that means?

Earl wrote shaft.

Max, I know it snowed,
you don't have to tell me.

I'm surrounded by so much white
stuff I'm like Al Pacino

in the last scene of Scarface.

What are you wearing?

You look like a bag of
crazy garbage grew arms.

It's the hefty 2011
winter collection.

I gave Chestnut my coat.

This is the only way
to keep the snow off me.

Look at poor Chestnut.

What is he wearing on his hooves?

I cut up my Fendi cashmere leggings.

I grabbed them when we
raided the town house.

I thought ahead for me,
but not for him.

He is humiliated in
those ladies clothes.

He looks like j. Edgar hoover.

I've been out here
sweeping since 4:00 A.M.

But it just keeps coming down.

What is your problem, snow?

I used to love you!

Maybe we should ask your old doorman

"insert generic
Irish name here" to come help.

I know their names.

Day James, night James
and black James.

So your plan is you're gonna
sweep the snow away till spring

while the horse
is trapped under this tarp?

Which I'm pretty sure was
covering the out of business

Cuban restaurant down the street.

They were out of business
and I left a note.

What did it say?
"I'm loco, gracias."

No, it said, "sorry I took
your roof, hang in there.:

Max, don't be so negative.

Doesn't matter where
it came from, it's working.

I just need to secure
this tarp a little.

Stop, you were gonna climb on

an icy chair in six inch heels
and break your neck

and then I'm gonna be stuck
with a horse in leggings

and you in a wheelchair
with a chopstick in your mouth

tapping out, "I'm sorry,
I thought that would work."

I learned to build when I volunteered

with habitat for humanity.

Looking back, they had
so much more than I have now.

Okay.

I gotta go to my babysitting job

and when I get back,
you and I are gonna sit down

and come up with
a more realistic home

for j. Edgar hoofer.

Max, he lives here.

And I'm telling you, this is working.

What I'm doing is
actually kind of brilliant.

Now I'm worried about
those houses you built.

Hey, Peach.

Max, I have the most incredible news.

Lawyer finally found
a loophole in your prenup?

I wish, no.

I just got an email

and I have made it to the final round

of casting for
Real Housewives of Tribeca.

Real Housewives of Tribeca?

They're doing neighborhoods now?

What's next, Real Housewives
of from here to there?

The producers are on their
way over and I want everything

to be perfect when they see
Brad and Angelina.

Uh, Peach, are you aware
that your children

are being eaten by clothing?

The snowsuits are Burberry.

And the padding hides
Angelina's weight problem.

Okay, you have to stop saying that.

She doesn't have a weight problem.

She's gained 25 pounds in one year.

Yeah, 'cause she started at zero.

Max, we all have
to look our best, 'cause ready?

The last spot in the show is
between me and Misty Mastbaum.

I thought she was your bestie.

She is, but my bestie's a bitchy.

She's crazy competitive.

As soon as we were
approached about the show,

she adopted a three-legged corgi
and named it Mr. Pickle.

That's crazy bitchy.

So now, I'm looking up
handicapped animals

to impress the producers.

Oh, you want a handicapped animal?

I got your handicapped animal.

I know a homeless horse
with gender identity issues.

I was thinking
something cute, but damaged.

Like a one-eyed French bulldog.

What if I told you that this
horse was a celebrity horse?

Tell me more.

My friend, Caroline Channing...

How do you know Caroline Channing?

She's my AA sponsor.

Makes sense.

Go on.

Anyway, she has this cute,
but crazy damaged horse

and since her life
flipped upside down,

he needs a good home.

Well, I'd have
to meet Caroline first.

Bring her by on Saturday.

Max, what an amazing idea.

Misty is literally going to die.

I am so thrilled
you have a drinking problem.

Did you have to
put him in my bedroom?

It was the easiest room
to horse proof.

You have so little of worth.

You can stop googling.
I already found

a perfectly good place to put him.

You're not still suggesting
I give Chestnut to Peach Landis?

Max, look at me.
Look at me in the eyes.

Are you high?

No, I couldn't find my bedroom stash

since you moved everything around.

Chestnut needs a home with affection

and Peach won't even
hug her children.

She pays you to do that.

That's why it's perfect.

She'll pay for the fancy stable

and we'll go and hug Chestnut
for her whenever we want.

You just need to
go meet her and it's done.

I have the DNA of a rich girl,

even though I'm lying in bed
with you in a tenement

and I bought
my dinner tonight with dimes.

Chestnut and I are old money.

And old money doesn't
parade itself around

in front of cameras
and beg for attention.

Hey, you're not
the only one with old money.

I've had a dollar in my jeans

I've been carrying around
for three weeks.

You're meeting Peach Saturday,

and we're saying good-bye
to the horse.

Why is getting rid
of Chestnut so easy for you?

Didn't you ever
have a pet as a child?

Yes, I had a puppy.

And after a week
of living with my mom,

he pulled the car over and put
us out on the side of the road.

She got rid of it?

Look, pets are not my thing, okay?

I already have
something needy and Fluffy

that'll die if I don't
take care of it... you.

Go, it's your turn
to go check on him.

No, I went the last time
and caught him eating my bra.

Don't exaggerate.
He only ate half of it.

Oh, I'm sorry, you're right,
I should be more positive.

One of my cups is half full.

What's going on in there?

I don't suppose there's any way

you took a giant dump
on your dresser?

You can't blame Chestnut.
He's probably nervous.

After wearing your leggings,

he's getting ready
for his fame audition.

He's a maniac, maniac on all fours.

Oh, Max, here's something.

The Ivy bridge
riding stables in Brooklyn.

Only five Miles away.

It says on their website
that their horses

are featured in
commercials and films!

Can you say Chestnut,
star of the war horse sequel?

Did you take the weed
from my bedside table?

Look at me.

Look at me in the eyes.

Are you high?

Honestly... a little.

Close that and go to sleep.

No, I'm still reading.

Oh look at that, I just pulled
down your browser history.

Interesting list.

Kitten plays a keyboard,

kitten sneezes and
farts at the same time?

Give me that, that's private.

Kitten folds a t-shirt!

Oh, kitten rings a doorbell.

I thought you said
you weren't into pets.

I'm not!

It's a kitten ringing a doorbell!

He's trying to get in like people.

You have a secret
soft spot for animals.

No, I'm just into freaky kittens.

There's one who puts on
a snakeskin suit

and goes on a business trip.

That's not soft.
That is freaky.

Fine, you're telling me to get
a reality check about Chestnut.

But you need one too.

You're gonna miss him when he's gone.

Max, are you listening?

Max, don't worry.

I know it's all
gonna work out perfectly

at the stables tomorrow.

I'm not worried.

The man's not here yet.

Damn it, turn us around Max,
we have to enter again.

This is the third time.

Max, come on, we borrowed
these coats from Oleg

to make a dramatic star entrance.

If you want me to fake it again,

you have to buy me dinner
and call me pretty.

Fine, then help me down quickly.

I don't wanna be mid-dismount
when the stable guy walks in.

God, ugh.

You just sat on my face.

Like I haven't done enough for you.

Oh, hello, are you Tony?

Last time I checked.

Oh, jeez.

I'm Caroline Channing.
We spoke on the phone.

And this is Chestnut.

Max, step back.

Oh, great.
I'll just be over here

like the awkward father
in the background

on Toddlers and Tiaras.

Well, here he is.

And as we discussed,
Chestnut is a champion jumper

his dressage is impeccable,

he's ribboned three times
at the Hampton Classic,

and he comes from
a historically elite line

of distinguished show horses.

And he pees like
a civil rights fire hose.

Max, step further back.

Come on, let's cut to the chase.

He's nice, brown,
he looks sick in leggings,

and he's free,
so take him or leave him.

When'd you say he was a jumper?

From 2005 to 2010.

He was in a class by himself.

Well, maybe he was a jumper,

but he isn't anymore.

What?

Well, he's a little out of shape.

Well, you have a gut.

Whoa! I'm just saying
he's seen better days.

I'm just saying your hair
is falling out in fistfuls.

- Whoa!
- Okay, okay.

Let's not get personal,
we all want this to work.

He's the one who's getting personal

going after Chestnut like that.

Okay, you tell me,

when's the last time he's exercised?

When's the last time you exercised?

Wow, show business is rough.

All right, it's Tony, right?

Last time I checked.

All right, Tony,
you'll have to forgive her.

She really loves him
and wants this to work out.

Bottom line is,
even a free horse isn't free.

I still have to feed him
and take care of him

and truth be told, this horse
isn't gonna make me a penny.

If my film guy comes in here,
he's gonna pick that beauty

over this one.

Oh.

So it's not gonna work out, girls.

All right, well, we got
other offers, fatty.

Come on, let's go.

You know, maybe next time
before you let someone

ride five Miles across
Brooklyn in a toxic, Russian,

cologne-soaked rent-a-fur,

you should be clear
that the film business,

even for horses,
is ageist and elitist.

And, yes, we may have
seen better days,

but with hard work,
determination and a little luck,

one day we'll be back on top.

Yeah, and I'm not impressed by
your big star pony over there.

He's just standing still.

You wanna impress me?

Have him meow and ring the doorbell.

Don't take it personally, Chestnut.

Those horses have had work done.

maybe you wanna take the cinch
sack off before you meet Peach.

No it's snowing again
and I'm a penniless beggar.

I should look like one.

Besides, she'll probably
think it's a look.

All right, I know this one on one

with Peach isn't your ideal scenario,

but it's what's best for Chestnut

so man up and face reality.

You're right.

And my friend, Caroline Channing...

What is it?

You might be ready to face reality,

but are you ready to face reality TV?

The place is crawling
with Peach clones

and TV cameras ready to meet you.

She totally set us up.

Are you kidding me?

Fabulous, this is awesome,
just awesome.

She's using the Caroline
Channing freak show

to get herself on another freak show.

All right, you're right, let's
go, you don't have to do this.

No, if I made Chestnut parade around

and be humiliated in public,

then I have to be
willing to do the same.

Here, hold my coat.

You always have those with you?

Yes, I'm from Manhattan.

- Okay, thank me for coming.
- What?

Thank me for coming, that's
what people did all the time

when I was a billionaire.

Thank you for coming.

No, thank you for inviting me.

Wow, that's so cool.

Don't freak out.

I'm about to get my rich on.

So when we go in there
I'll introduce you?

Oh, you don't have to.

Rich people always pretend

to know each other.

Now open that door,

and let's get my baby a home.

Peach.

I wanna thank you for inviting
me into your beautiful home

and showing me such kindness

during this very difficult,
difficult time.

Ladies, I would like you all to meet

my dear friend, Caroline Channing.

Who, in light of her recent
very difficult, difficult

financial troubles, has asked me
to adopt her damaged pet horse

who was brought to my attention
by my alcoholic servant, Max.

Right over there.

Caroline,

thank you for coming.

No, thank you for inviting me.

I'm proud of you.

No, I'm proud of you.

I just got the chills again.

Oh, Max, look at him.

He's smiling.

He likes this place.

Yeah, it's almost worth you
being humiliated on reality TV.

Oh, I'll never be on that show.

I didn't sign the release.

What?

Old money don't sign.

You're gonna love it here, huh?

Aren't you gonna love it here?

A nice big stable.

Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

Maybe I should come home and
live with my best friend, Max.

What about Caroline?

She can sleep under the tarp.

So I guess you found your weed.

No, this is just something we
do when we're alone together.

It's kind of our thing.

You really love Chestnut, don't you?

He's all right.

He's no kitten.

Okay, I'll see you soon, Chestnut.

You want a minute alone?

I'll be out front.

Hey.

This is probably gonna
seem ridiculous to you

because you're a horse
and I'm just some lady

that's been slipping you carrots
for the last few months, but...

I really got attached to you.

This is way more than most
horses get out of me.

I wasn't even this upset when
they discontinued tan m&ms.

I, um...

I really haven't had much
go right for me in my life,

and I'm pretty sure things are
gonna keep getting worse but,

you were a good thing.

And when everything sucked,

you were the best thing we had going.

And you're fuzzy too.

You're so fuzzy, and no one can argue

that touching a warm, fuzzy
thing isn't straight up lovely.

So, thank you for everything
you did for us, but...

Especially for being fuzzy.

Max, are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine, I'll always be fine.

Are you crying?

Yeah, I'm crying,

'cause I wish I could live here.

Don't worry, we'll come visit,

and we'll find a way
to bring him home in the spring.

Come on.
I have a pocket full of dimes.

Let's go get
some convenience store taquitos

and wash 'em down with
blue raspberry wine coolers.

They're on sale at the bodega.

Two four packs for five dollars.

You know exactly what to say
to cheer a broke sista up.

And when we get home, I found a video

of a kitten singing Bruno Mars.

Hi, ready to order?

Do you have anything
that's really special?

Not according to my
high school guidance counselor.

I'll have the veggie plate.

But instead of beets,
I want kale.

And instead of broccoli,
more kale.

I want the veggies steamed.

And instead of dressing,
I want lemons.

Don't you need
to write this down?

I'm afraid if I start
writing that down,

it'll turn into a suicide note.

I'm assuming
this table's gonna have

a lot more of those requests.

Yes, I could tell by the hats.

Earl, I have something new
I want you to try.

That's the exact same sentence

that got me hooked
on cocaine in the '80s.

It's my new cupcake flavor.

Delicious dark chocolate
the ladies can't help but love.

I'm calling it
"The Earl."

I know you got that right.

Hi, I'm here.

I was running late
so I decided to hail a cab.

And then I remembered I didn't
have any money on me.

And then I remembered
I didn't have any money at all.

So I walked the whole way here.

The apartment's
three blocks away.

Yes, I know.

Three blocks
and 15 "Hola chicas" away.

Well, you can't be late again.

I'm already worried
about me being late...

every month.

On my way here, a homeless man
asked me for money.

And I told him
that I usually always give,

but that my father was indicted
in a Ponzi scandal

and I've lost my family fortune
and my Manhattan townhouse,

so I've been sleeping
on a couch in Brooklyn,

but, in spite of it all,
I'm still optimistic

that you and I
will achieve success

in our exciting new cupcake
business venture.

I prefer to think
of Bob near the bridge

as our first investor.

Pickup!
Special sandwich.

I can think
of even more special sandwich.

You, me
and the hot blonde giraffe.

Well, she recently
lost her dignity,

so you might have a shot.

Hello today!

I have nametag for you.

Only your second day
and look, nametag already.

As new owner, I am killing it.

Thank you.

Oh, it says "Carolin."

It's Caroline.
With an "E."

I'm Caroline.

As new owner, I am sucking it.

Just put it on.

You can't tell an Asian
he made a mistake.

He'll go in the back
and throw himself on a sword.

Thank you,
Mr. Lee.

You may call me Han.

H-a-n.

No trap in my name.

I'm thinking we should take

the first step
in our new cupcake business

by writing
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes"

up on the specials board.

No, I can't have
my name up there.

Everyone I owe money to
thinks I live in Seattle.

Oh, we used to own Seattle.

Max, we've got to get
the name out there.

Create a buzz.

Ooh, good idea!

Let's create a buzz.

Exactly,
in order to launch--

I'm mocking you.

When in doubt,
I'm always mocking you.

Seriously, Max.

This new cupcake business
is our lifeline.

A way out for both of us.

And I wanna thank you again
for letting me move in.

If there's anything
I can do to help you--

You mean besides
starting to wait on tables?

I meant, anything I can do

to help you through
your breakup with Robbie.

Oh. Thanks,
but I'm fine.

And we're working.

Well, one of us is.

Are you sure you're fine?

'Cause I heard you
crying last night.

I don't cry.

I sold my tear ducts to an organ
bank for cash two years ago.

I was on the couch.

And I heard you crying alone
in your bedroom.

Really?
What did the crying sound like?

Like...

I wasn't crying.

Well, then what
were you d--

Oh! So none of
my business.

That's right.
And remember that.

Got it.

In fact, let's just say
that anything having to do

with my bedroom, my tables,
or my life--

you should stay away from.

Boundaries.
Got it.

And please
don't tell anyone at work

I let you move
into my apartment.

That is one boundary
we both don't want crossed.

Why?

Hey, roomies.

That's why.

Hope those sheets are okay.

Oh, don't worry about it.

I know they're the best
you could afford.

Not really.
The good ones are on my bed.

Max, that oven is so hot.

Could you do me a favor
and open the back door?

We've known each other two days

and you're already
asking for back door?

Dear God!

I forgot
you're Equestrian Barbie.

You came with a horse.

No.

Out, horse, bad!
Bad horse.

Chestnut.

No need to yell,
he's a champion.

Champion stink bomb.

It's smelling pretty ripe
out in that yard.

That's not Chestnut,
that's Brooklyn.

Okay, well, I'm watching
"The Champion"

drop some steaming hot
"Brooklyn" right now.

Max, I've been thinking about
how you completely overreacted

to your name
up on the specials board.

Do you think it's
a fear of success?

I am too poor
to have a fear of success.

At Wharton Business School,
we learned

that every new venture can bring
up a certain amount of fear.

Is there any way
to do a yelp review

of Wharton Business School?

Maybe you're having
a hard time imagining

this cupcake business
could ever even happen

because nobody ever believed
in you or your dreams.

I'm guessing.

I can make this happen, Max.

For me, for you, for us.

Just keep making
those amazing cupcakes.

And I'll do the rest
till you believe.

I believe
everything you just said

and that children
are the future.

Max, it's me!

I know it's you.

You sleep with a knife
under your pillow?

It's the only home security
system I can afford.

And I'm a cutter.

I can't sleep on that couch.

I think Ikea might be the
Scandinavian word for sciatica.

And there's weird sounds
in the street.

And I don't have
my white noise machine.

Well, that's
Puerto Rican noise.

You'll get used to it.

Can I just lay down here
and get a little sleep?

I don't even let the men
I sleep with sleep with me.

I can't get into
your issues right now.

I just need to sleep!

Fine, get in then.

What is that?

Potato chips.
I sleep-eat.

Cool ranch and bacon?

Dude, they're delicious.

Because of your breakup
with Robbie?

Just get in.

I have to be in the city
to babysit in five hours.

Oh, great,
you're like a nightlight.

You're so blonde.

Thank you.

Max, someone's
in the living room.

Max, someone's in the bedroom!

Robbie!

What's up, babe?

Robbie, what are you
doing here?

We broke up.

Still?

Yes, still.
You hit on me.

And then she caught you
with someone else

in these very sheets.

Which I'm hoping she washed.

Oh, I get it.

You blew me off
'cause you like the ladies.

Which is cool.
I like the ladies, too.

And right now,
it's the two ladies I like.

Robbie, if I were
gonna go lesbian,

she would be the last "les"
I'd "bian."

Listen, babe--

You really hurt her.

Stop.

She sleep-eats trans fats
thanks to you.

Here, stuff all of these
in your mouth.

Got it, your thing.
I'll be quiet.

Robbie, this isn't cool at all.

Mm-mm.

Showing up here
after what you did?

You go, girl.

I have something to say to you
and you had better listen.

Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

What are you,
the relationship ghost?

Robbie, just go!

I can't say what I need to in
front of the relationship ghost.

I'll call you
to come get your stuff

and we can talk then.

Leave the key.

Straight up, Max,
you're breaking my heart.

You're the only woman
that I feel this way about.

Here.

Ladies, I don't know
what's going on here,

but it would've been
a lot sexier if I was in it.

Are you okay?

If you wanna talk, I'm here.

Can I get a hit off that?

You think these are good?

God, we're poor.

Morning!

It's a beautiful day.

These shades belong down.

From now on, think of me
as a vampire

without all
the annoying marketing.

Bad news.

A pipe broke in the street
so the water's off.

Good news, when I went out
to get us two coffees,

I spoke to Juan and Javier,
two city workers.

And they assured me the water'll
be on no later than 3:00.

I also stopped
at the health food store

and got us
a fresh-squeezed juice to split.

It's ginger-apple-strawberry.

That was the name of the hooker

who had this apartment
before me.

What is this?

From me.

It says "Thanks for letting me
sleep in your bed last night."

I prefer my usual cash
on the bedside table.

When I went
to the cute coffee place,

I spoke to the counter girl,
Nabulangi--

If someone named Nabulangi
is making an appearance

in the first sentence,
I have to sit down.

And she said
her manager'll be in at 11:00.

So I thought I'd chanel it up,

walk on over there,

introduce myself
and your fabulous cupcakes.

That's exactly what
I was gonna do.

I'm just gonna go say good-bye
to Chestnut and get going.

You know, having
only one cute outfit

takes hours off
getting dressed.

Oh. That is a lot
of fresh Brooklyn.

Morning, Chestnut.

It's a beautiful--

No. Way.

Look, Chanel Number Two.

Tell me it's mud.

T-tell me it's mud.

It's mud?

What is that?

A carrot?

There's carrots in the mud?

There's no water.

Oh, get it off me, please.

Please do something.

Just get it off me,
get it off me.

Stop!

This is dry-clean only.

Max, please, please take me

somewhere they have
a hot shower, I beg of you.

Calm down, it's just mud.

Max, please--

Don't touch me!

Thank you so much
for taking me to shower

at your babysitting job.

Well, I didn't have
much of a choice.

You pulled the pillow knife
on me.

I'll just introduce myself
to your boss

and tell her what happened.

Look, I don't want Peach
to know you were here.

This is a job.
Not a meet-and-greet.

Got it.

You get in there, you
take a five-minute shower,

clean it up and go.

Fine, I'll hide in the hallway
till she's gone.

No need, just follow me in.
She never really looks at me.

Morning!

Hi, Max.

Go!

Hey, Peach.

Uh, hair and makeup.

What's the big occasion?

Pilates.

Max, good news.

They found a way
to make diamonds more sparkly?

I got Brad and Angelina
a playdate

with another set of twins
in the building.

It starts in five minutes.

Cool, what are their names?

6B.

Bye-bye,
Brangelina.

Mommy loves you.

Guys?
Before you leave,

stop at this one.

Angelina could
use a little help.

Contour that neck,
she's a fatty.

Peach, come on,
that's baby fat.

Still, kids can be cruel.

Don't you listen
to your mommy, Angelina.

She never eats.

Oh, no, she doesn't.

Here it is.

Caroline with an "E."

I have your new
and correct nametag.

Oh, thank you, Han.

Oh.

I've seen something
I should not have.

I will just put correct nametag
here on counter.

So sorry, but many thank yous.

What are you doing?

I know you said
you don't want it up there.

But now that you see it...

How does it feel?

It feels like
you're not listening to me

at this job or at my other job.

I said a five-minute shower
and get out.

Did you take a nap at Peach's?

The thread count
was calling to me.

Peach found blonde hairs
in her bed

and thought her husband
was cheating on her.

Which he is,
but that's not the point.

You almost ruined
a perfectly happy fake marriage,

and there are
innocent children involved.

Well, I have some good news.

Look, it's Nabulangi.

I invited her in
to taste your amazing cupcakes.

And when she loves them,
we'll have an in at her bakery.

Come over and say hello.

No, I can't now. I wanna call
Robbie before we get too busy.

Tell him when to come over
and get his stuff.

Max, wait.

No, don't distract me.

I wanna sound cool and hot
and all like,

"You can't have me
anymore, sucka."

Max--

Robbie, it's me.

Classy burp
on your outgoing message.

Max, I--

No.

I need you to come
get your stuff tomorrow.

I don't know how
you've been surviving

without your chin-up bar
and Axe body spray.

Max, hang up.

I already called him.

You called Robbie?

You've done so much for me.

I wanted to do
something for you, too.

So I called Robbie
and I had him come over,

and I gave him his stuff.

Now you won't have to go through
with all that mess.

And I think you'd be pleased,
I really let him have it.

What is with you
and boundaries?

You're in my bed,
you're in my boss' bed,

and now you go and call Robbie?

You're like--
you're like your big-ass horse.

Charging in everywhere
you don't belong.

I thought I was
doing you a favor.

In spite of what you say
about the sounds I heard

coming from your bedroom
the other night,

I know you're upset.

I was masturbating.

I love my job.

I need to see you
outside. Now.

Don't get involved with her.

She takes money
from the homeless.

Not true, Bob's an investor.

Be right back.

Good cupcake, right?

Max, I don't know
how smart that was,

blowing by our only potential
business contact.

You stole my breakup scene.

The only remotely good thing
about breaking up with a guy

is telling him how much better
you are than him

when you give him back
his stuff.

I don't know if you noticed,

but my entertainment budget
is pretty low

and I was really
looking forward to that.

And then you went and stole it.

But I guess
you couldn't help it,

'cause that's what you channings
do, you steal things.

Huh.

Interesting.

Okay, you wanted
a breakup scene?

You're in one.

I'm breaking up with you.

Oh, okay.

The cupcake business is over,
the dream is dead.

Oh, I'm sure Nabulangi
will be devastated.

I don't need you
or your cupcakes to survive.

I'll figure something else out.

Because, aside from your
constant Wharton putdowns,

I'm a business genius

and I will always land
on my feet.

Oh, really?

'Cause today you kind of
landed on your front.

We're done.

After work tonight,
I'll get my things and be gone.

Ooh, you gonna load up
your dream-filled wheelie bag

and ride away
on sir muds-a-lot?

Go ahead.
Be as negative as you want.

'Cause you're in charge
of your own future again.

Oh, joke's on you.
I don't have a future.

Max...

Are you up?

No.

Max, are you mad?

Yes.

Are you up and mad?

No and yes.

Oh, your bed's so soft.

That's my boob.

I know I moved out,
but I came back.

I took the rest
of our dead dream money

and bought some cocktails
for myself and some people.

And myself.

Did you bring me back
any of those?

'Cause I can't
listen to this sober.

Max...

I have nothing.

I really need
the cupcake business.

I can be different.

No, you can't.

No, I can't.

But I can be better.

Please?

Please, let's do this.

I know you have
a fear of success.

You do, because no one
ever believed in your dreams.

But I believe in your dreams.

We have a dream.

God, you are so drunk.

So you probably
won't even remember this.

I'm sorry I said that stuff
about your father.

Did you hear me?

Max, are you up?

Hey, do you have any more
of those poor people chips?

What's up, hangover three?

Why are these up?

I thought we were vampires.

Here, I took the rest
of last night's cupcake money,

and brought you a coffee
and a fresh juice.

Which means that,
after two days in business,

we are $23 down
from where we were.

So we're still building
our cupcake business?

Sure.

All we need is how much?

$250,000.

Which is awesome.

Max, I'm sorry
I crossed all those boundaries.

It's cool.

Me and drunk Caroline
worked it all out.

In fact...

She signed this paper.

"I, drunk Caroline,
am a..."

What's that word?

Punk ass ho.

Thanks.

"I, drunk Caroline,
am a punk ass ho.

"I promise to keep
my big mouth shut,

"and replace all
of Max's poor people chips.

I will no longer meddle
in her relation-chips."

You laughed about that
until you threw up.

Oh, and if you're wondering,

no, the puke stains
will not void this contract.

God!

I forgot again
that we have a horse.

Max, get him out of here.

He doesn't know I'm a waitress.

Chestnut.

He is a champion.

He learned that a lot
faster than you did.

Max, what's a five-letter
word for "happy"?

And it's not my first wife, Helen.

I was gonna suggest "drunk."

Maybe 'cause I am.

Hey, everybody!

Hey.

Guess what I have under my coat.

And it's not ice cream
sundaes like last time.

It's my baby bump!

Aw, Sophie, you're showing!

And this time, it's not
either of your nipples.

Ah, look! Only four months.

And I'm already approaching Kardashian.

And that's quoting the doctor.

Impressive.

You may have a North, South,
East, and West in there.

The baby really kicks.

So it's either gonna be a soccer player

or a Los Angeles policeman.

Hey, Han, what do you think

of my baby bump, baby bump, baby bump?

In my country,
we never comment on two things:

women's pregnancies
or Kim Jong-un's haircut.

One tuna malt.

That was a tuna melt.

Oh.

Max, here comes Han.

Now remember, we have to be extra nice

so we can get his support
for our new dessert bar.

How can he support us?

He can barely support his giant head.

See, that's the kind of stuff

you're gonna have to stay away from.

What's this about?

Last time you were smiling,
I almost lost an ear.

Well, my Hollywood money
has finally arrived,

and as you know, Han, Max and I want to

convert the cupcake window
into a dessert bar.

And as you know, I want to
convert you two into waitresses.

Come on, Han, it won't
affect the diner at all.

All we want to do
is use the dish room...

home of two of the three
original strands of E. coli.

It's a no.

My therapist said
this had to be the year

of standing up for myself
and cutting out soda.

All right, well go ahead, stand up.

But because I would like to see
you make someone else miserable,

I know a real estate agent
that could help you two

find a new space.

Did you say "real estate Asian"?

Her name is Evie,
and I know her from my church.

And let's just say she's been angling

for what I've got dangling.

Your keys?

She likes me, you shrews!

Okay, well that's what
we get for being nice.

So back to the dessert bar,

did you get the pictures I sent
you of those cool stools?

I saw the subject heading
was "cool stools,"

and I thought you finally
shattered our last boundary.

Here, give me your phone.

I can't find the stools.

Oh, my God!

I can't believe what I'm seeing.

Is it that dog driving?

No, why do you still have a picture

of your ex-boyfriend on your phone?

You swiped on my phone?

What if I had something
embarrassing in there?

Like a tasteful hoo-ha shot?

Why do you still have a picture
of Randy on your phone?

The guy who broke up with you
in L.A. using a therapist?

This bespeaks of an unresolved longing.

Be-stop be-talking right now.

I am gonna delete them, I just
haven't gotten around to it yet.

Like being nice to people.

Oh, my God, this is too weird.

- What?
- It's Randy.

Does Max work here?

This smells like the place
she described.

That smell's how I find
my way to work every day.

What is he doing here?
I don't want to see him.

Then don't turn around,
'cause he's right behind you.

Max?

Hey.

Good to see you.

You're not gonna turn around?

No, I'm good.

You're not gonna turn
around for that guy?

I mean, I would turn
around for that guy.

See on the board you
have some specials.

I guess I'll have the sloppy... job?

It's "Joe."

Sometimes my "E"s look like "B"s.

Clearly, I need to start writing
the specials on the board.

You know what,
just give me the meat... load?

That one, sadly, is spelled right.

Randy, what are you doing here?

Lawyer stuff.
I'm in town for the weekend.

My client, Tony Bennett,
is suing Lady Gaga

for making him uncool.

And I thought I'd come by and
see if Max wanted to see me.

I guess I also wouldn't
mind a cup of hot caca.

Max... you're not gonna turn around?

Okay. Guess I better go.

Well, bye.

Bye.

Damn it!

Fell for the ol' Scooby
Doo fake footsteps.

- How are you?
- I'm great.

Never been greater.

Max, I need someone to clean up

the baby-changing station
in the ladies' room.

- We don't have one.
- We do now.

I guess I better let
you get back to work.

If you want to see me, give me a call.

Tony has dinner
and goes to bed around 3:30.

Randy thinks he can just
show up with his face

and his body and his
muscular-but-not-too-thick neck

and think I'm gonna
forget that he dumped me?

Max, don't say "dumped."

Say "kicked to the curb." It's kinder.

Oh, Max, we have an
unattended package situation.

Not unlike that homeless guy
we just passed on the stoop.

Wow, that's the biggest box I've seen

since I accidentally clicked on
a "big, beautiful women" porn.

It stops being an "accident"

when you wake me up by yelling,

"Hey, check out this 'big,
beautiful women' porn!"

Well, this is exciting.

I haven't had a surprise delivery

since that baby I felt
was just Chipolte.

Max, that never really happened, right?

Whatever makes you sleep
sounder, sweetheart.

Never happened.

Oh, good God!
It's three kinds of popcorn!

And all kinds of disappointment.

Crazy?

You've got your standard butter,

you got your sweet, sweet caramel,

and finally, the popcorn
that needs no introduction,

cheese!

Cheese-us, that's good.

It's from Randy.

"I know it's corny, but I miss you.

Love, Randy."

Oh, great, so he's a great writer too?

Why am I mad at him again?

All right, he obviously
knows your sweet spot

is the grocery aisle at Rite Aid,

but I am not gonna let junk food
cloud your judgment again.

Like that time you donated blood
for a chocolate chip cookie.

Hey, I also got orange juice.

Hey, girls.

Max, this was delivered
upstairs for you.

Uh, sorry about the bite marks,

but the baby a whiff of the
pimento loaf and said,

"Oh, I just got to have it."

"I know I was a jerky,

so let me say sorry with salami."

What, does Randy have, like,
a team of writers

working on these things?

Randy?

You mean that hot guy
with the muscular neck?

Muscular, but not too thick.

Yeah!

He's trying to win you
back with salamis

and delicious biscotti?

There's no biscotti in here.

Oh, yeah, well...

the baby needed something sweet.

Oh, my gosh.

The baby just kicked.

Oh!

Oh, that brings me so much joy.

It did it again!

Oh!

My gosh.

Hey, I think it's following the salami!

Thank you so much for showing
us the space today, Evie.

I'm sure Max will be here any minute.

It's hard for her to be on time.

Or sober for more than an hour.

Well, the pros are the
location and the price.

And the cons are the
11 people I'm guessing

have died in here.

It is a little small,
but people like small.

I know I do.

And I know I am very curious
about the natural light in here.

And I can make anything pretty.

Just ask Suda Mahmoosh
from high school.

Everyone called her Bert
till I worked my tweezer magic.

Well, you have to act now,
because there are three other

very attractive offers on the table.

And one wants to take me on a cruise.

What did I tell you?

She's undressing me with her eyes.

Well, I'm buttoning you
back up with mine.

Oh, I have to take this.

And Han?

What did she say to you in Korean?

'Cause she was coming at you hard.

That she wants me to come at her hard.

Well, what's the problem, Han?

I mean, she's cute and she likes you,

and it's not your job to ask why.

That's mine and Max's.

The problem is that she's
from a very conservative family,

and she wants to be a virgin
when she gets married.

A two-virgin marriage.

That's cute.

Or is it too matchy-matchy?

No, no, she wants to have
sex before marriage.

I'm confused... she wants be a virgin,

but she wants to have sex?

Oh!

Like an "everything but" situation.

So to speak.

She's found a loophole,
and it rhymes with loophole.

What?

Below the waist, she's like a mullet...

business in the front,
party in the back.

- Still nothing?
- Yeah, I got it!

I just don't want to talk about it.

This is a conversation you
need to have with a man.

And when Max gets here,

I'm sure she'll make fun of you

and then tell you what to do.

I'm sorry, Caroline.
The space just got rented.

Spaces don't stay empty
for long around here.

Han, can you walk me to my car?

I need help putting
something in my trunk.

I'm right behind you!

I mean...

Where are Mickey and
Minnie Mouse going?

Max, where were you?

You're late, we lost the space,

and I had to learn that
our real estate agent

wants to have sex with Han,
but remain a...

front virgin.

Please understand me.

Oh, she's working the
ol' loophole argument?

What, you never heard of that?

The girls at St. Bridget's invented it.

I can't take any more of this!

That's what they said!

But then they did.

Shouldn't you be coming in
through the back door?

I got to say, Max, I'm really surprised

you didn't cave in and see Randy.

You're showing more
backbone than a supermodel.

Yup, I'm not gonna see Randy!

I'm not seeing Randy at all!

Okay, and they say I'm the loud one.

Get out of here, Caroline!

Who I am talking to.

Uh, can you go outside

and bring me something from outside?

- Like what?
- Oh, I don't know.

A souvenir from Coney Island.

An old woman's hat from Manhattan.

Okay, sure. Outside stuff, got it.

Thanks. Take your time.

What are you still doing here?

You said you were just gonna
take as shower and leave.

I was waiting for the water to get hot.

Took four hours!

You have to go before
Caroline gets back.

Wow, I haven't snuck
out of an apartment

since I helped my friend
escape Scientology.

Well, she's back.
And you two are busted.

I knew he was in here.

I saw his 12-pack in my phone

when I was taking a couch selfie.

And you let him use my towel?

It's also my sheet/dress
for summer weddings.

Okay, you know what?

I'm gonna get out of your dress

and give you two a minute.

I can't believe you had sex with Randy.

More than just sex!

Stay out of this!

You said you were gonna mull it over.

Weigh the pros and cons.

You know, before you came here,

I used to date pros and cons.

I'm not used to thinking about stuff

and making sound judgments.

I just found out last year there
are instructions on medicine.

Well, I'm sorry if I want
what's best for you.

Just throwing this out there...

got a great job, nice house,

full-fledged AAA member since 1998.

Please, this is between me and Max.

We have to figure out
what to do about you two.

Well, I-I like him, but I
don't want to get hurt again.

See? Those are pros and cons.

This is exciting.

What's going on out there?

'Cause it kind of sounds
like I'm on trial.

You know what? This is a big decision.

Maybe we should all just sleep on it.

Isn't sleeping on it what got me
in trouble in the first place?

I thought of another pro for Randy.

He looks like a man from
the front and from the back.

Very rare in these times.

Okay, I'll put it on the list.

Oh, no, this is my list
of reasons to stay alive.

You should know I'm down to one.

Oh.

Evie found a small place in
Brooklyn she wants you to see.

As for the small place
she wants me to see,

I haven't decided.

Caroline, let's get some
pros and cons going

for Han taking the A-train.

I mean, this is the closest
to a vagina that any of us

ever thought you'd be.

So if I decide to pass,
you won't think less of me?

Han, that would be impossible.

Hey, everybody.

You know, you get a seat on
the subway if you're pregnant

and willing to sit on
an old person's lap.

Sophie, what's a
seven-letter word for... oh, hell.

Three years is too long
to spend on one crossword.

According to my mom,
it's too long to spend

in third grade too.

Carol, come to my booth.

I think my baby's gonna kick again.

Uh, Sophie, we're kind of working.

Oh, you got a job?

Hey, there.

I'm, uh, here for Max.

Oh, and 14 across?

Papaya.

Damn! I'm back in!

Randy, we actually haven't
come to a decision yet.

Well, I want my day in court.

Oh, you could have mine.
It's the third.

As you know, I'm a lawyer.

And I usually don't
practice in a courtroom

that serves something called pork chip.

But if I'm gonna be on trial here,

- I'm gonna make my case.
- Okay, but let me just say...

Do you want the list of pros and cons?

I got this.

I need to make sure
that I can trust you

with my best friend's heart again.

Oh, my God, that was pure Good Wife.

Max, go have a seat in Sophie's booth.

That's fine, but I'm getting
some of that pork chip.

It's good, baby.

It comes with a side of ass potatoes.

Randy.

You live in L.A. Max lives in New York.

Did you or did you not say you're bad

at long-distance relationships?

I did.

And did you or did you not say

that you're just in
town for the weekend?

Well, I did say that...

Ma'am, do you or do you not see me

conducting a mock trial up in here?

Randy, did you or did you not

break up with Max using
a therapist because...

you couldn't do it yourself?

- Well, I...
- Answer the question!

Yes.

Caroline, girl, you are good.

Where were you when I got arrested

for being black in Tacoma?

You're living in L.A.,
Max is living in New York,

and you're both living in denial

if you think a relationship can work.

May I approach the booth
and mount my defense?

You mounted the defense
three times yesterday.

Objection! Kissing the witness!

What the hell is going on out here?

They are putting that white
Billy Dee Williams on trial.

You're right, I did hurt her.

Breaking up with her using
a therapist was a bad decision.

Breaking up with her at
all was a bad decision.

And why should she trust
me if I'm just gonna

blow into town for the
weekend and leave?

Well, for a lawyer, you're not making

a great case for yourself.

Yeah.

I mean, if I were you, I'd just

take my shirt off right now.

And the truth is...

I'm not here on business.

Tony Bennett isn't suing Lady Gaga.

Although he should.
I'm just not involved.

I came to New York for
the weekend to see Max.

And she's the reason I'm gonna stay

in New York for a month

to see if we can make this work.

I think that should count as two pros.

You're really gonna stay here for me?

I couldn't stop thinking about you.

I didn't even delete
your photos off my phone.

Well, that's pathetic.

So I think I found the perfect
space for your dessert bar.

It's got to be better than
the other holes you showed us.

Well, it's in the trendiest
part of Williamsburg,

cheap, and the landlord
is a really nice guy.

It's so close to the diner.

Won't it be weird if we run into Han?

And not with a car?

Okay. This is it.

Hello!

Oh, no, I hate puppet shows.

Evie, this isn't available,
it's a cupcake shop.

Unless those two girls finally gave up.

I've decided to let you expand.

Evie convinced me to do things
outside my comfort zone.

- Yes, I did.
- How 'bout that, Caroline?

We're not the only ones she
showed a dingy, dark hole to.

Get your minds out of the gutter.

She took me to hot yoga.

He vomited two "oms" in.

But at least he tried.

So who knows what's next?

Well, I've never had lobster.

Han, are you sure about this?

You'll let us build
our dessert bar here?

I'm sure I'll regret it
almost immediately.

Han, I would hug you right now,

but the cons outweigh the pros.

This is gonna be the coolest bar!

We just have to get rid of that.

Wow! Bummer, dude.

You have a time machine?

And somehow, it got programmed
to this crap diner?

I must admit, I am
quite taken with steampunk.

Oh, steampunk, right.
I remember that trend.

It happened for,
like, ten seconds

back in 2000
and-are-you-kidding-me?

Dude, seriously,
you're sitting

in a public place
tap-tap-tapping

on an oldie typewriter?

What are you?

In the league of extraordinarily
pretentious gentlemen?

Aren't you being
a little aggressive?

Yup.

That's how people are
here in the present

where we live.

But don't get me wrong.

I'd like to go
back in time, too.

Maybe stop 9/11 or that creep
who had sex on my shoe,

but I can't.

Present?
Where's that uniform from?

Like, 1998?

Oh, stop,
or I'm going to have

to shoot you
with a Smith & Wesson

I'm currently packing
in my bloomers.

I'll go get thee a menu,
my good man.

attention, everyone.

Max and I have a little
late-night treat for you.

Don't say it
all excited like that.

Now when it's not drugs,
Earl's going to be pissed.

You are invited
to a very important taste-test

of Max's homemade cupcakes.

Okay,
but I will have only one.

When I get a tummy,
single ladies call me Buddha

and rub me for luck.

I gotta watch out, too.

Last time I had Max's
chocolate espresso cupcake

before going home,

I was awake
till 5:00 A.M.,

hand washing all my thongs.

doesn't mean there's
not swing in the sling.

Oh, Caroline, darling.
Can you go back over there?

I forgot my racing form.

Oh, horse racing?
It reminds me of Chestnut.

Max... Chestnut.

What's with the sad face?

Your horse is living it up
at a fancy stable nearby.

Not gone to the great stud farm
in the sky.

Did someone say
"stud farm"?

My fee is $10 a quart or $15
if you want a boy.

Wow.

You bounced back from your
Sophie breakup pretty quick.

It was not
a real breakup.

I will have her
very soon again.

Right now, I lay low
and wait in bushes

like determined jungle cat.

Or a rapist.

Racing forms,
here you go.

Earl,
maybe some time

you will take me out
to the track with you.

I used to ride horses
all the time in Korea.

The mechanical ones
for a quarter

in front of
supermarkets?

Actually, Max,
I'm a very good rider.

In fact, I was training
to be a jockey

but was too short.

Too short
to be a jockey?

That's a hard hit,
my man.

Han, I had no idea
you loved horses, too.

Why didn't you
ever say anything?

Well, why didn't you ever ask
about any of my interests?

I'll tell you why.

Because all you ever talk about
is "our cupcake business,"

our cupcake business."

Doesn't your cd
have other tracks?

Anyway,
our cupcake business

has a very important
meeting tomorrow

with Paul Platt,
the party planner.

I know
a party planner, too.

He sells J .Lo.
and Salma Hayek Pinatas

off back of truck
for Cinco de Mayo.

Awesome.
Put me down for a Hayek.

More storage space
for candy.

Well, our party planner
is the it guy in Manhattan.

And tomorrow,
Max and I are doing

a tasting for him
at his office.

How can someone be too short
to be a jockey?

Isn't that
the whole point?

Are you all right, Max?

I got here
as fast as I could.

Caroline texted me
to hurry over

because you didn't know
you were pregnant,

and you were giving
birth over toilet.

So I grabbed
my plunger and ran!

That is insane.
I never texted that.

No, I did,
when I stole your phone.

I needed a reason
to get Sophie over here.

I can't believe
she believed it.

Oh, come on, Max.
Giving birth over toilet?

That is very you.

Now that you are here,
Sophie, sit.

I want to tell you
something important.

Well, you can forget that.

There's no way
I'm going to stay.

A cupcake party?

Oh, look, and this one
even has a pretzel in it.

Yup, that's
our "salty n' spice"

for our more
adventurous customers.

Also for
the uptight white people,

we have
the very, very vanilla

which is... big surprise...
My favorite.

And this is our beer-batter
maple bacon

spring break cupcake.

That's for stoners,
and big surprise, my favorite.

We can only
take four flavors

to represent
our cupcake business.

See? Not one word ever
about anyone else.

I have a pet ferret,
if anyone gives a damn.

Well, I have
some big news

I want to share with you
all as well.

Sophie, that classy lady
right over there...

Mm, I like this one.

She recently
broke it off with me

because she wanted
to be with a man

who had a dream
and a drive.

So I have bought
a drive...

A Lincoln town car.

Yes, I have a new car service
and slogan:

"Lie back and I will ride you
till you tell me to stop."

So, oleg, you now have
a town car business?

And Sophie,
you rent town cars all the time.

Oh, oh, please.

I mean, I love pizza, too,
but that doesn't mean

I have to marry papa John.

I was just thinking,
you might want to come out back

and take a look at the light-up
makeup mirror on visors.

Light-up makeup mirror?

Oh, I might be interested.

But not just you and I.

Han will come as well.

Finally! Han is getting
invited to something.

Other than LinkedIn.

- So much for the taste test.
- It's fine.

I know what's best
for our cupcake business.

I do say that a lot,

but I think
it's kind of charming.

I'll go get our coats.

Mm, mm, mm.
Look at you.

I must say, I'm impressed
with how far you've come.

Well, you burn
a few thousand cupcakes,

you're bound
to get better.

Not just the cupcakes, Max.

Look how far you've come.

When I think of that girl
who came in here

just looking to get by...

Hey, and check you out now.

Big, fancy meeting in Manhattan.
Lordy lord!

- It's only a meeting, Earl.
- Maybe.

But if you were
one of these horses,

I'd put all
of my money on you, Max.

Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

Poor kid.

If I had that job,
I'd be asking someone

to please hold a gun
to my head.

He's probably excited
to be working for Paul Platt.

Look at
all these magazines

calling him
the next Martha Stewart.

Someday, we'll have
articles about us.

You know,
pictures of you and me

standing outside
our country home.

Hold on.

We're rich and still
living together?

Okay, she's leaving.
This is us.

About time.

Been sitting here so long
my ass is asleep,

which kind of goes against
my theory that it won't quit.

Hi, Paul's going to be
a little longer.

It's fine.
It's just...

Paul Platt parties,
please hold.

- Paul Platt parties...
- How much longer...

- Please hold.
- Me or them?

I got the ass
pins and needles.

- Max.
- What? We're on hold.

Have a seat.
Five more minutes.

Paul Platt parties.

The word "party"
at a party planner's?

Little obvious.

Like me having art that says
"will die alone."

Wait.

I think this is Johnny's art.
No way.

"No way" is right.
Johnny's a nobody.

Paul Platt wouldn't have
a framed "Johnny" in his office.

Look, signed "j. Peg."
That's his tag.

Yo, what's the deal
with this art?

It's a street artist.

Everyone's getting
really into him now.

Oh, yeah?

He was trying to get into me
a few months ago.

It was more emotional
than that.

He cheated on
his girlfriend with her

and then blew her off.

It was really hard
for us.

And you thought
me slapping my ass

in front of him
was inappropriate?

- Wow, Johnny made it.
- Well, good for him.

He's making it,
we're making it...

We're making it?

I magic-markered
over the scuffs on my boot,

and we can't
even get past

the poor man's John Cusack
over there.

Max, we are making it.

We've come a long way.

We haven't used
Starbucks napkins

for toilet paper
in months.

And now,
look where we are.

We've got a meeting
with Paul Platt.

"We're making it."

I'm serious.
Say it, Max.

We are making it.

Okay, we're making it.

- Caroline channing.
- This is us!

- Ahh.
- What, five more minutes?

Monday at 4:00.
Something came up.

Oh, okay.
Well, Monday at 4:00.

There's no Monday at 4:00.

He said Monday at 4:00.
Monday at 4:00, right?

Absolutely.
Monday at 4:00.

There is no Monday at 4:00.

I'm confused.
Is there a Monday at 4:00?

In the books, Monday at 4:00.
Paul can't wait.

There is
no Monday at 4:00.

I don't understand.
Are we coming in Monday at 4:00?

Absolutely.
Paul's a big fan.

Don't come in on Monday.

Can you please tell me
what's going on?

See, it's this news
about your father being moved

to a cushy white collar
prison this week.

Paul can't have anything to do
with someone named channing,

'cause everyone
in New York is pissed.

Look at all that.
It never stops.

How much more of this
do I have to take?

So we'll see you
on Monday!

Don't come.

I woke my ass up
for this?

Mmm.
This was delicious, Max.

Here's a $20.
Keep the change.

What are you doing,
Sophie?

You don't pay
for the cupcakes.

No, take it
for your business.

Ever since your big
party planner meeting went bust,

I was worried
that you two girls

might form
a joint suicide pact.

Nah, we're
not that organized.

So how's Caroline today?

She's handling it all
better than I thought.

She's with her father's
lawyer right now,

trying to figure out
the best time for her

to go out to the prison
to see him before he's moved.

Oh, that is my new phone.

You know there's a phone
stuck to that gay furby, right?

Yes, this is from my
favorite store on 14th street,

rhinestoned.

Oh, it's just a text
from my driver.

He's waiting out front.

Why don't you
just invite oleg inside?

I'm not sure yet
he deserves to come inside.

Well, from what I heard,
he's already come inside.

Oh, Max, I love it
when you're dirty!

Hey, how'd it go?

Well, according
to my father's lawyer,

the prison is surrounded
by so much press

that daddy doesn't want me
to come out there

and be exploited
all over again.

Why is he still
the only news story out there?

Well, the good news is,

your hair
is especially shiny today.

It is?
Thanks, Sophie.

So try not
to kill yourself.

Well, if I didn't kill myself
reading these in the car,

I won't.
Hate mail.

It was being held
at my old P.O. box.

My father's lawyer
picked it up for me.

Why didn't he just punch you
in the face and call it a day?

I know, it's like the end of
miracle on 34th street,

only everyone's
calling me a bitch.

Oh, come on, not everyone
is calling you a bitch.

"Dear bitch,
I hate you."

"If I ever see you
on the street, I will..."

Shake your hand
and wish you well,

as you have been through
so very much.

That is not
what that says.

It might be.

It's hard to read
his actual words,

as they are
written in blood.

Oh, look how fancy.
This is not hate mail.

No, this is invitation to
metropolitan museum annual gala.

It is?

This is my favorite social event
in all of New York.

I've gone every year
since I was 18.

It's a fashion ball
at the museum of art...

Yeah, I know
what it is.

- I catered it last year.
- Max, how weird.

We were probably
right in the very same room.

Then there's a good chance
I spit in your drink.

Not really, unless you were
acting all prissy and demanding.

There's a good chance
you spit in my drink.

Well, see?
This is happy news.

No, as much as I want to,
I can't go.

Everybody hates me.

And much worse,
I have nothing to wear,

and if you're gonna be hated,
you better look damn good.

I give up. That invitation
finally broke me.

Why are you
pulling down your bed?

Because I don't have
a door to slam.

Hell, I don't even
have a door!

Everything's
been taken away, Max...

My fortune,
my business career,

my social life,
my sweet, sweet horse.

Okay, take a nap.
You're upset.

You have
a good reason to be.

A good reason?

I say she has
200, 300 good reasons.

I mean, read these.

These are like
letters to the devil.

I'm just going to get in there
and never get out.

Close it up, Max.
Put me in the wall.

No, it's really hard to
close it when you're in there.

I've tried.

Look, I know
it's not even remotely close

to what you had before,

but we do have
our cupcake business

and our purple stove,
and we do have $922.

And we're gonna make it.

Wall me.

Come on, all you need
is a big, glamorous party.

I mean, look at
all the celebrities

Martha Stewart,

Justin Timberlake...

Ooh, Hugh Jackman!

Oh, I like to call him
"huge" Jackman,

because I bet
he has a big penis.

Wall me.

Thank you, sir.

Welcome home, buddy.

As you can see,
we haven't put the pool in yet.

We'll get to it.

Tree, grill, shovel...
Usual cast of characters.

Now, I am going
to take you in to her,

but I should warn you.

She hasn't been
out of bed for two days,

and that means no tooth brushing
and it's bad up in there.

I'm pretty sure horses
have a keen sense of smell,

so just be prepared.

I missed you, too.

Max, I'm trying to sleep.
Take your boots off.

Caroline,
I have something for you.

Go away.
I'm dead.

Jeez, and you said
my breath was bad.

You have a visitor,
someone you love.

Chestnut!
Chestnut, hi, baby, hi.

How did he get here?

I went to peach
and told her

it was a matter
of life and death

and we had
to have him back.

And what,
she just gave him back to you?

Well, I did have to agree
to come back and babysit

one day a week
for the rest of my life,

but hell, Chestnut's home.

Max, thank you so much.
You brought me back to life.

Oh, my God,
don't exhale on me.

Your breath is like you
went down on a brussels sprout.

Tip your head that way.

Chestnut, Chestnut.

Don't breathe
on him either!

His whole head is a nose.
He can't handle that.

Chestnut's home.

Han, I'm so excited.

Did you hear
my horse is back?

This is
not conversation.

This is just
the other thing you say.

"My cupcake business,
my horse,

my horse,
my cupcake business."

Well, in case
anyone's interested,

my ferret's name
is Alvin.

And Alvin's
telling his friends

he has a pet named han.

Hey, Earl.
Long time, no see.

Well, well, well,
Johnny.

If it isn't
the famous street artist.

Well, I'm hardly famous.

You got that right.

My remark was
laced with sarcasm.

Can you tell Max
I'm here?

That depends.
Are you still a two-timing bum?

That's his name,
don't wear it out.

Hiya, slugger.

Can you do me a favor
and call Earl off?

I may be on day six
of my p90x,

but I'm in no shape to take on
a heavyweight like him.

It's okay, Earl, we're cool.

Well, I am.
He's just riding my fumes.

So, uh,
where's your section?

- Counter.
- Hm, same ol', same ol'.

Johnny's in the diner.

Why is he here?
It can't be to eat.

He's "made it."
He eats "made it food" now.

Well, obviously,
he's here to see you.

Or else he won the award for
biggest lying jerk in New York,

and this is the first stop
on his press tour.

Well, I don't know
why he's here,

but you better
come with me.

He looks really good,
so I'm not listening

to a thing coming out of
his pretty mouth.

Well, I was gonna
ask what the specials were,

but you know what?
Can I actually just get

one of Max's
homemade cupcakes?

- Okay, which flavor?
- Surprise me.

Kind of like how you surprised
her with your girlfriend?

Okay, I'm starting
to get a vibe here,

and that's why I came in,
because I feel bad,

the way things
went down between us,

and I came to say good-bye
because I'm moving.

Oh, moving.
To where?

- Manhattan.
- Manhattan?

That hardly calls
for a good-bye speech.

It's over there.

Yeah, I know,
but it's a big change for me,

and we're not going
to be rolling

in the same circles
anymore,

and I'm getting married...
Over there.

Well, at least you and
your girlfriend worked it out.

Actually, we broke up.

This is someone
I met a couple months ago.

I was only
watching his lips,

but did they just say
what I think they said?

Well, there's your cupcake.
That'll be $5.

The price has gone up.
Yeah, we're successful now.

In fact, we may be working
with Martha Stewart.

Caroline knows her
from, you know, before.

We're gonna talk it over
with her

at the met gala ball
that Caroline got invited to.

Martha's on the committee.
Caroline goes every year.

Not a big deal.

My first time.
Not a big deal either.

In fact, none of it's
a big deal,

just two girls
who are making it

but who choose to stay
in Brooklyn 'cause we're cool.

That's awesome, Max.
That's awesome.

It's just funny,
because whenever I think of you,

I think of you in this diner
in that uniform.

In a good way.

You want money now?

Yeah.
It's business.

It's not like we had
a relationship or anything.

In fact,
you can pay Caroline.

She's the money.
I'm the artist.

You know, I'm doing pretty
well as an artist myself.

I've been selling
a lot of my stuff.

Really?
We hadn't heard.

And there's your cupcake.

In case you didn't notice,
that container's to go.

Got it.

He's gone.
I got rid of him.

Max?

What are you doing?

Punching cheesecakes.

It's my version
of going to bed for two days.

Are you more upset
about the marriage thing

or the uniform thing?

Oh, this isn't about Johnny.
I'm mad at the cheesecakes.

They were supposed
to have cherries on top,

and I wanted cherries!

Why not me?

Okay, maybe it's half
no cherries, half Johnny.

Nothing ever
does work out for us.

And then I hear myself saying
all that ridiculous stuff

about us talking
to Martha Stewart at the gala.

I mean, what was that?
It's insane.

Is it?

Wait, seriously, is it?

Or is it just insane enough
to be genius?

Max, we have the invitation.
She'll be there.

Why are we wasting our time
with Paul Platt

when we can
meet the real thing?

We can take Martha
our best cupcake,

explain our situation,

and maybe...
Maybe she'll talk to us.

I mean, she was a girl
with a dream once, too,

and she certainly
understands hard times.

You are talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart.

I am talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart!

I even have my gorgeous Judith
leiber jeweled cupcake purse

to smuggle the cupcake in.
It's perfect.

I knew there was a reason
I took that from the townhouse.

Great, you have a cupcake
and a cupcake purse.

What else are we gonna
wear to the ball, cinderella?

Are the rats in the alley gonna
whip us up some ball gowns?

I mean, it's not exactly
like we have a fairy godmother.

Hey, look, girls!

I got myself a crown
and a wand at rhinestoned.

I'll have the soup
in my booth.

Well, this is as close
to a fairytale

as you and I are ever gonna get,
so what the hell?

Max, does that mean
we're gonna find

a way to go to the ball?

Oh, yeah.
Get your cupcake on,

'cause we're gonna
get balled.

Sophie, this is
so generous of you

to offer to buy us dresses
for the gala,

but as much as my shoes
love being back

- in their place of birth...
- Oh, your shoes were born here?

Mine were born in China,
but I adopted them at payless.

Maybe we should
find something cheaper,

at one of
those consignment stores.

"Consignment stores"?

Come on,
what are we, gypsies?

This is big fancy ball.
We need ball gowns.

Never really been
a fan of balls.

In fact, always thought
they got in the way,

but here we are.

Well, we do have
to look amazing

if we're approaching
Martha Stewart with a cupcake,

so we'll find
a way to pay you back

and start by doing some
cleaning jobs for you for free.

No! Every year
I give money to charity,

and I like
you two girls

way more than the babies
with the broken smiles.

So don't worry.
I got plenty of cash.

Aww, a roll of hundreds.

Reminds me of my Christmas
stocking stuffers.

Yeah, this is fun day.

I'm like Richard Gere
and you're my two hookers.

Well, when you put it
like that,

I'm a little
more comfortable.

Good afternoon.
How can I help you?

Hi, how are you?
We don't have a lot of time.

We have to be
at work by 6:00.

Can you show us your best
formal spring couture?

Perhaps you ladies
might be more comfortable

down in ready-to-wear.

As I said,
we're in a bit of a rush.

We might move a little quicker
if you dropped the attitude

and picked up
some dresses.

Show her your wad.

Let's look
at some dresses.

Yeah, and get us
some champagne,

like in the movies.

One, two.

Han, did you just go up
on your tiptoes like a big boy?

Well, I wasn't expecting
a photo opportunity.

And I left my tom cruise
man-heels at home.

Max, give him a break.

This is a man who was
too short to be a jockey.

Oleg, give me your camera.

I must approve picture.

We've taken it
three times already.

Han, if you want
a nip slip, just ask.

My dress is too pretty
for this conversation,

so I'm gonna go get the cupcake
from the refrigerator.

And I'm going to warm up
my new town car for the ladies.

New?

What is this, 2002?

I hope so,

then I will have chance
to meet you for first time

all over again.

Now this is not
professional driver talk.

Hey, fancy ball Buster,
what's your deal?

You told him to get
a dream and a drive,

and he did.

Max, I have two sore spots.

Trusting men and...

And here, where that
crazy Jamaican

wove my extensions
too tight.

I'm thinking I should wait
to put the cupcake

in the cupcake purse
till we get out of the car.

We want our beer batter
maple bacon cupcake

to represent
our cupcake business.

We have a new record.

She cupcake four times
in one speech.

We should go.
Upper East Side from Brooklyn

at this time of day
is crazy.

But we came in here
to show Earl.

Maybe Earl decided
not to come

since he had the night off.

Max, we really should
be there at the start.

That's prime Martha Stewart
stalking time.

You're right.
And Martha will probably

have to leave early
to get up to bake;

A little something
I knows about.

The only difference
between Martha and I

is she probably doesn't
have to worry about

waking up her roommate
who lives

four feet from the oven.

But otherwise, twinsies!

Hold up, hold up, hold up.

Earl, slow down,
your heart.

Sorry I'm late, ladies.

But if I run any faster,
the cops

tend to pull guns on me.

Got held up
at the florist shop,

but I made it.
Here you go, ladies.

Aww, Earl,
you got us flowers?

Wrist corsages.

I hope they're still
in style.

They're a classic, Earl.

Like you.

Mmm, that was
worth the run.

Let's go, ladies.

Oleg is waiting
to drive you.

And you drive me crazy.

Yeah, yeah.
Tell it to the marines.

Here, Earl,
take my phone.

I can't fit it
in the purse with my cupcake.

Have the best time
in the world.

And say hello
to "huge" Jackman for me.

That is not a good sign.

That car is smoking harder
than Bob Marley

on a rasta holiday.

Sophie, if my cousin Yuri
said he would be here

in half hour
with parts to fix,

he will be here
in half hour.

Actually, it's been
40 minutes.

Your cousin is like you.

- He takes too long to come.
- Oh, this is news.

Suddenly a woman
wants a man to finish fast.

Oh, please.

Sex is not
a carnival cruise.

I'm a busy woman.

You get on,
you get off.

Can I get a hit off that?

We'll just have to wait,
I guess.

I mean, if I still lived
in Manhattan, I'd hail a cab.

But that's not gonna happen
out here in the boondocks!

Plus, even if we could
afford a cab,

we'd be stuck forever
in rush hour gridlock.

Could you take it down
a notch?

Hipsters are starting
to look at us

like we're trying too hard.

Where did han go?

He said he might
have a plan.

Oh, my lord and Taylor!

That little mother
can ride.

You two look like
two princesses in a fairy tale.

Are you feeling safe?

I couldn't feel any safer

if we were riding
a rubber into town.

Here we go.
Bye, guys.

- Bye.
- Go, Chestnut!

Oh, check it out.
You see what I see?

Hello, officers.

We're on way to the ball
down the street,

and we were wondering
if we could please leave

our horse with your horses?

And I can save you
the time

on the breathalyzer test;

No, we are not drunk

or on some bachelorette
party scavenger hunt.

Our car broke down
in Brooklyn,

so we rode over
the Brooklyn bridge and up.

You rode a horse
across the Brooklyn bridge?

That's badass.

Yes...
And illegal.

In that case,
we took the tunnel.

Well, I think we can help
you two ladies.

Not gonna happen, Dave.
We're on duty.

Officers, we're already
a little late.

And with all due respect,
we don't have time

to play good cop,
bad cop.

Or in your cases,
hot cop, hot cop.

Well, I think we can help
you ladies.

Let's get you down
off of there.

I got the one
in the low-cut.

Thanks officer hot
and officer hotter.

You know I'm officer hotter,
right?

Oh, come on, man.
Have you seen me

in my sunglasses?
No contest.

Max, I'm really impressed
with how well

you're maneuvering around
in that long skirt.

Yeah, I was a serving wench
at a medieval times restaurant.

It's a breeze
when I'm not carrying

a tray loaded
with Turkey legs and ale.

There's the "will call"
table.

Walk in front
and I'll hide behind you,

as I'm the most hated woman
in New York.

So basically,
I'm a human shield?

Well, you have more up here
to stop anything.

- Max!
- What?

Did someone pull a gun?

I knew that
was gonna happen.

No, I screamed because
I saw the couple

whose sworn statement
put my father in prison.

Max!

Acid in your pretty face?

Sorry, I stayed up
all night reading

what people want to do
to you in your hate mail.

What was it?

I went down so fast,
I may have smeared my cupcake.

That's the filthiest sounding
clean thing I ever heard.

It's fine. Good.

Now let's go get those cheap
plastic security bracelets

that ruin
our expensive gowns.

- Can I get your name?
- Caroline...

Channing.

I'm sorry, what?

Caroline...

Channing.

What's with you?
Just say your name.

Channing.

Did you say channing?
Caroline channing?

Wait, are you
that Caroline channing?

Shh, yes, and I personally
called the R.S.V.P. number.

It has to be there.

Channing,
channing, channing...

No, I don't see
"Caroline channing."

Shh.
Maybe it's under my name.

Max black.
I'm with her.

Black... no, no, no,
I don't see any blacks here.

You mean besides
the ones working security?

Let me check with Paul Platt,
the party planner.

He's on the phone
with him right now.

- Hey, Brody.
- Oh, no.

There's a problem
with the list.

She's not on it.
Her.

- Caroline channing.
- Sh

Paul, I've got
Caroline channing,

and she's not on the list.

If everybody in this line
could just wait until

we get the Caroline channing
situation under control...

If you say "channing"
one more time,

I'm going to actually
pull your voice box out.

And its s so much
more violent than it sounds.

Yes, Paul,
I'll tell them.

There's been
a little mix-up.

Five more minutes
will get you right in.

You're not getting in.

Well, that's it.
We tried.

- We gave it our best shot.
- Oh, no.

This is the closest
I have ever gotten

to anything in my life
almost working out.

- We are not giving up.
- How are we getting in?

- Security's everywhere.
- Yeah, out here,

but not
at the servers' entrance.

I catered this
last year.

That's right,
we're going backdoor.

Ooh!

That lady
just punched me.

I knew
that was gonna happen!

So you can
just walk in here?

Anyone can
just walk right in?

Well, it helps
that last year

I made out with
the tent flap guard, Rico,

but basically,
yeah, anyone.

When I think
of all the times

I left my purse
on a table here unattended,

I shudder...
Shudder.

Okay, so we can't
get in the actual building

without being caterers,

so we have to change
into those uniforms.

Wait.

You never mentioned
anything about

a rent-a-clothes
situation.

Small price to pay
for us making it.

Is it? Is it
a small price to pay?

Hurry, we have
a superstar to stalk!

I thought I would hate it,
but I'm kind of into it.

I'm very Janelle Monae.

No, you're Janelle
I-have-no-Monae.

What are we going to do
with our dresses?

We can't leave them out here.
I need them inside.

I have to look amazing
when I meet Martha Stewart.

What does it matter
what we're wearing?

We're still going to be
the two crazy girls

chasing her down
with a cupcake.

- That's why it matters.
- Oh, ooh!

I know.
Here.

Help me get
the shelves out of this.

We can hang
our dresses in here

and push them in.
Brilliant.

Kind of like the Louis Vuitton
travel wardrobe I used to have.

Or the service elevator
I was born in.

Coming through, hot food.

Look out, very hot!
Man, it's hot.

You're a waiter,
not a weatherman.

Hey, pretty girls,

I like the way you push around
that big steel box

why don't you come over here
and I'll have sex with you?

A display like that
really makes you appreciate

oleg's nuanced wit.

Okay, let's go right
to the ladies room

so we can change.

Is it that way
or that way?

What?

Shh, Johnny!

How'd he get invited?

This used to be
an exclusive event.

He's "made it,"

he goes where
"made it" people go.

Why are we hiding
from that lowlife?

If he sees me
in another waiter uniform,

I'm the sad girl
always in the uniform.

If he sees me
in that dress at the ball,

he can suck it.

Ladies room, that way.

The ladies room
is right down here.

Push harder. Harder!

Do you want Martha
to see you dressed like that?

- Move! Coming through!
- Excuse us.

Food emergency.

Fingers, fingers,
fingers, fingers.

Coming through,
coming through.

- Excuse us.
- Look alive, red!

- I almost hit you.
- Hold up.

Now just hold up.
What is going on right now?

You can't bring
food in here.

Oh, it's not food.
That would be weird.

It's dresses.
We have to change into these,

'cause she has this guy
she wants to impress,

and I have to change
into it

because I'm stalking
Martha Stewart.

Ooh, I'd be
a terrible spy.

Usually I don't get
the long stories

till the end of the night,

and by then,
the girls are crying

and begging me
for Wisdom and tic tacs.

I'll go first.

I have to get two of these
in one dress.

Miss, do you have
a shoehorn?

Come on,
chanel shoes!

Come on,
chanel knockoffs.

Why are you
not dressed yet?

'Cause ladies take forever.

It's all the spanx.

Well, go, use my stall.
I want to go stick my head out,

and see if I
can scope out Johnny.

No, ma'am, no!
Not fair, ma'am.

Try the handicapper.
This side.

Good idea.

I cannot
get a break tonight.

- Psst, yo, Max.
- Johnny!

Who are you looking for?

The Dominos guy.

I was hiding in there,
'cause five more minutes,

the pizza's free.

I was hoping
I'd run into you.

Eh, no big deal.

Pretty big deal.
You look amazing.

Amazing. I will go
as far as amaze-balls.

Thanks.

You look like a guy
in a commercial

who has a ring and puppy
hidden somewhere.

Can you believe it?

We're both
at this shmancy thing.

Look how far we've gotten.

Actually,
when you think about it,

we didn't get
very far at all.

Nope, you're right.
We didn't.

Yeah, why?

Timing, I guess.

Timing?

Okay, whatever.

You know, from now on,
when I think of you,

I'm gonna think of you in this
and not the uniform.

You know,
from now on,

maybe you shouldn't
think of me at all.

Gotta go,
Mr. Manhattan.

That was awesome!
Caroline, where are you?

I'm almost dressed.

I just had the perfect
in-your-face good-bye

with Johnny.

And speaking of
"in your face,"

he couldn't take his eyes
off my boobs...

Boobs that
he can never have,

now that
he's getting married.

Damn, girl, you look good.
What you doing later?

Can I get your number?

Oh, no, the cupcake got
a little smushed in my purse.

We can't show this
to Martha Stewart now.

Sure, we can.

You think she never
had a cupcake smush on her?

I doubt that very much.

Martha Stewart
is perfect.

Her feet don't even
touch the ground.

The woman probably doesn't
even go to the bathroom.

Martha Stewart's
hardly perfect.

And how are you
this evening?

No, you're right,
Martha Stewart isn't perfect.

Oh, I never said that!

In fact, I hear
she's a real ballbuster.

You did not hear that.

Yep, a real ballbuster,
you know?

No, I do not know.

Would you mind handing me
a towelette please?

Oh, one's fine.
Thank you so much.

But the fact that Martha
Stewart is so tough...

Caroline, you need
to get out here right now.

The fact that she
is a real ballbuster...

Oh, dear God, help me.

Is what I like
and respect about her.

I mean,
the woman's a genius.

Now it's getting
interesting.

And besides, you can't
really believe gossip.

Look at all
that hate mail I got

with people
calling me a bitch,

and I'm not a bitch.

Well, that's debatable.

- Martha Stewart, hi.
- Hello.

I'm Caroline, and this is
my business partner, Max,

and we have
a start-up cupcake business.

Dude, are you serious?
You're still going for it.

I know this is
highly inappropriate,

but we brought
a cupcake here tonight

in hopes that
you might taste it.

So you want me
to taste your cupcake

in the ladies room.

What's inappropriate
about that?

We're a start-up business.
We've got to take risks.

This is Max.
She's the baker.

You're the baker.

I'm the baker.

Hm, it looks
quite appealing.

Oh, my God.

I know this
is a social event,

so I'm so sorry
for making it about business.

When you're in business
for yourself,

you have
to take every situation

as a business opportunity.

Look, I have
five of these in here.

I love your magazine.

I read every single issue

until they realized I didn't
even go to that doctor.

Well, in spite
of the fact

that you have not
yet washed your hands...

I was just changing
my dress in there.

- I'll taste it.
- You will?

I like
your entrepreneurial drive.

And I have a feeling
that it's actually

the only way I'm gonna
get out of here alive.

That is our beer batter maple
bacon spring break cupcake.

- Hm, clever name.
- Thank you.

It is a little smushed,
though. That's unfortunate.

I told you.

Mmm.
Quite tasty.

I like it.

Do you girls have a card?

Get it out, get it out,
get it out.

Ah, thank you very much.

"Max's homemade cupcakes."

Well, you know who'd
really like that cupcake?

Stoners.

She said
"Max's homemade cupcakes."

Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!

Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!

I just got a $20 tip on a $10 check.

I may be the greatest waitress
ever and strangely that doesn't

make me want to die.

You're finally getting the hang
of a job you've had for years.

Is your last name Obama?

Another big tip. I think it's my smile.

Well, something's smiling.

Pickup Patty melt.
Correction, panty melt.

- Caroline you have...
- What Max? Pride in a job well done.

Yes, some of us can still feel pride.

Yeah for another 10 seconds.

Caroline...

This reminds me when I saw
my mother's side boob.

Max, you have to say something.

Caroline!

Hey, look, I just got a $10 tip
from this guy and I spilled

coffee on his face.

Screw it, I'm taking the
ab-straining money tab.

Nope, not wearing underwear.


I know it's technically good
to have a big order,

but I am five cupcakes away

from what professional
doctors call T.Rex arm.

Like you always tell me...
use your other hand.

It'll feel like a stranger.

And how about our new business labels

and my ability to be excited
about literally anything?

I got them with the
money you were saving

for that Porky Pig bong.

But when it's down to just resin,

it says, "That's all, folks."

I'll pay you back as
soon as we get the money

for this big order for... L?

Max, someone named L
ordered these cupcakes?

Oh, that's not an L; that's an I.

Sorry, I learned printing
mostly from ransom notes.

I?

I mean, what kind of person
would just be named I?

This kind.

Hello. That's my order.

Yes, they're just about
ready, mis... ter...

I'll spare you the stress
and confusion, dear,

because I can tell by
the size of your pores,

you're a sweater.

She is.

Sometimes she gets so nervous

watching "America's Next Top Model"

our couch is slick for days.

Spoiler alert: none of them
are America's next top model.

To be clear, I am neither he nor she,

Mr. nor Mrs., male nor female,

and the only part of me
that's transitioning

are my heels from day to evening.

I am simply I, and I cannot be labeled.

I am gender fluid.

That's cool.

As long as none of it gets on us.

Is my order ready, or do
I have to wade through

more of this poor man's Amy and Tina?

I like to think of us
more as an Ike and Tina.

I'm just finishing
boxing them up for you.

It's okay for cupcakes to
still be put in a box, right?

Just not people.

I'm using your cupcakes
in some performance art.

See, I is a performance
artist this month.

Last month, I was working
at the Cold Stone Creamery

on 8th Street.

Well, I've had sex there.

Yes, well, who hasn't?

The audience will bite into
one of your pretty, pink,

femme-looking cupcakes, only to discover

that I have inserted
a cocktail weenie inside.

But who wants to be surprised
by a little weenie?

I don't mind it.

It's an interactive
experiment that challenges

how we instinctively label one another.

But I don't have to explain
my performance piece to you.

You're not my advisor at The New School.

Forgive me.

I wasn't criticizing your piece.

Yeah, we're still not even
sure if you have one.

Can you excuse us for a minute?

And by the way, the
fuchsia in your blouse

really brings out the red in your beard.

People are gonna see our adorable labels

and think all our cupcakes
are stuffed with wieners.

Would it kill you to have a wiener

stuffed in your cupcake?

Look, someone is paying for them,

and that someone can do

whatever the hell they want with them.

I said the same thing to the people

who bought my kids.

We don't want someone
to deface our cupcakes.

They're meant to be enjoyed by children

or single women when a romantic comedy

hits too close to home.

Money is money. It doesn't matter.

Just put the cupcakes in the bag.

I don't feel good about this.

Sorry, but we're just not comfortable

selling you our cupcakes.

He is right here. Bag it!

What did you just call me?

- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

I did not say the thing
you thought I said.

I didn't even think it.

In fact, I wasn't listening
to half that crap you said.

She said, "bag it,"
with a B, as in boy...

or not a boy.

Oh, I see what this is.

This is just another homophobic bakery

trying to deny service to people like me.

Well, I don't have to stand here

to tell you how upset I am.

That's what Yelp is for.

Oh, no.

I think Kathy Bates is really mad at us.

Well, that sucks.

Now I want a hot dog.

Where are all the customers?

I haven't seen this few people since...

You went on Tinder?

Your sweet 16 party?

Caroline, throw one in there.

Your season of "The Bachelor"?

I was going to say

so few people since a sale
at your cupcake window.

Boom! I just schooled you.

Well, preschooled us.

Hey, everybody.

Oh, my gosh.

You girls, I raced over here so fast,

I left half my hair in Midtown.

Love the babushka, baby.

Reminds me of my Aunt Schmirna.

Great boobs: one big, one small.

Something for everyone.

Yeah, the gays, they're real mad at you.

Yeah, my stylist, Carl,
told me about two girls

with a cupcake shop in Brooklyn

who didn't want to serve a
member of the LGBTQ community.

LGBTQ?

Those are the trains I take to get here.

Oh, my God. Max, this is terrible.

I know.

Earl only lives a block away.

Why is he taking five trains?

The gays are steaming mad.

You know, if I were you girls,

I would stay away from the Village,

the East River, the Hudson River,

Melissa Rivers,

Pinkberry,

Broadway.

Yeah, and good luck
shopping for dog clothes.

Come on, Sophie. It's not that bad.

Not that bad?

If it wasn't that bad, would
I have left the salon

looking like this?

Oh, my God.

They sent you out like that?

They do hate us!

I know. Tell me about it.

I look like Donald Trump

before they Velcroed that
dead cat to his head.

A classic good news/bad news situation.

Good news: I figured out
where all the customers are.

Bad news: they're aggressively
protesting your cupcake shop.

You went to Supercuts, didn't you?

I hope you're happy, girls.

Now even Han thinks he's better than me.

No cake equals hate.

No cake equals hate.

No cake equals hate.

No cake equals hate.

Okay, this is bad.

I haven't seen this
many angry gay people

since that NBC "Peter Pan."

There they are.

That's the one that refused
to sell me cupcakes.

Oh!

Hey, all right, come on now.

The one with the bee-stung lips,

or the one with the
unfortunate side bang?

This is just a misunderstanding.

Max's Homemade Cupcakes is pro-gay.

- I love gay people.
- She does.

She's pretty much
dated them exclusively.

This little business is our dream.

♪ I dreamed a dream ♪

♪ In time gone by ♪

♪ When hope was high
and life worth living ♪

♪ I dreamed that love would never die ♪

Wrong dream, Blondie.

No cake equals hate.

No cake equals hate.

No cake equals hate.

No cake equals hate.

No cake equals hate.

- No cake equals hate.
- I've called every one

of my exes to come
down and vouch for me,

and they're freezing me out.

It's like I'm asking them
for sex again or something.

I was sure this would
clear up on its own,

but I always think that

because I can't afford penicillin.

The diner's still empty.

Did you two get bored
killing your own business

and decide to go after mine?

I can say, on behalf of all women,

none of us are ever going
after your business.

Apparently you've never met Martha,

the portly cashier at my
neighborhood Rite Aid.

I'm gonna go talk to
them, set them straight.

Well, as much as I can,
given the circumstances.

We have been trapped
in here for two days.

It's like we're in Gaytanamo Bay.

I'm gonna open this window
and tell them to screw off.

Free speech.

Your feelings got hurt. Too bad, so sad.

Oh... my God.

You should have sold
him the damn cupcakes.

I'm Cher, bitch.

What happened?

Cher hates us too.

We must be wrong.

That's not the Cher, Max.

It's a Cher impersonator.

Then why do I have chills?

I love Cher.

I used to imagine she was my real mom

and that one day she'd pick me up

and take me away with her,

and then we'd get matching
see-through body stockings

like normal mothers and daughters.

Aw, that's so disturbing.

Max, we did nothing wrong.

You can't just back down

because of some female impersonator.

Now you're blonde.

Look, Cher, we did nothing wrong.

Hey, look. I want a cupcake,

and nobody... and I mean nobody...

is gonna rain on my parade.

Attention, everyone.

Attention, everyone.

This is the owner of the diner next door,

and he has something to say,

so let's listen to our gay comrade.

Oh, I'm not gay.

Well, that explains the sweater vest.

Yep, I'm straight. Love the ladies.

I'm a bit of a chick magnet.

You're barely the size
of a refrigerator magnet.

There.

Another insensitive remark,

this time about the
little people community,

just like my friend here.

Oh, I'm not a little person.

Max, do not say anything.

Fine.

But this used to be America,

home of the free and land of the insult.

Everyone, maybe I can clear this up.

That woman over there
doesn't hate gay people.

- She hates all people.
- Yeah.

No cake equals hate.

Sophie, what are you doing?

Oh, hi. Sorry, girls.

No cake equals hate.

Hey, be fair and fix my hair.

Hi. Excuse me.

Oh, no, did we also say something

to offend the L.L.Bean community?

Max, now straight people
are mad at us too.

The cashier in the diner
said this was the best way

to get to you.

He also told me his CD
was a bargain at $5.99.

I can't believe you got
past the protestors.

I would have thought those boys

would have the back door covered.

Man, it's crazy out there, right?

I mean, however people
run their business

should be their own business.

That was always the company line
when I worked for that cartel.

I read about your situation
on the internet,

and I want to order 500 cupcakes.

Is there a Mrs. L.L.Bean?

There is. Happily married 15 years.

Terry Williams.

"Family Foremost Foundation"?

Yep, the FFF.

Wow, three of them.

You people really like a good F.

Well, we're a group

of independent business owners like you.

We're in town for a
convention on Sunday.

Information is on the card.

We'll bet there with 500 cupcakes.

Oh, Terry, what kind of cupcakes?

It's your business. You decide.

- Max, how about that?
- I know.

The Brawny paper towel guy
just saved our asses.

Good afternoon, family.

Good afternoon, Terry.

It's so weird for me to
hear the word "family"

not followed by the word "court"

I hope you have some energy left

for the leader of our family,

the man who always puts family foremost,

Brother Dan.

Good afternoon, family.

Good afternoon, Brother Dan.

And thank you, Brother Terry,
for that warm introduction.

Are they stuck?

Um, I think there might be one more F

in Brother Dan's plan.

Today, we are here to celebrate
that most perfect union:

the family.

We rejoice in the family.

We live, we love, we lust...

wholesomely, of course, for the family.

And today, our family has
found two new daughters.

Girls, why don't you come up on stage?

Oh, you don't want her to get on stage.

In fact, why don't you
get that spotlight off us

before she starts to sing again?

Don't be shy. You two girls went up

against today's politically correct mafia.

You stood up to the family destroyers,

with their tan, shirtless torsos

and their free online pornography.

Come on up for a hug.

Come on.

Just walk past the stairs and keep going.

No money is worth being
part of whatever this is.

Let's make a break for it.

And we have a big surprise.

Here's a check made out to
Max's Homemade Cupcakes

for $10,000!

Let's make a break for it
after we get the check.

Every night this week,
I have wept in the arms

of my loving wife, Peggy.

I have wept about the
plight of these two girls,

and I am very thankful that
we could all pull together

to ease their pain.

Thank you.

Max, Caroline,

come closer to me.

Closer?

Does he know we don't have penises?

Come close so I can present you

your giant check.

I just wish I'd brought my giant wallet.

No one has to know we're
getting money from them.

Right now, millions of
people are watching

as we stream live around the world.

Oh, this is streaming right now?

Max, this is streaming.

I'm streaming a little in my pants

about this check.

Right now, all around the world,

people are seeing what morals look like.

These are the girls who are standing up

against the deviants, the divorces,

the scientists, the hop-hop lovers,

and...

the doobie smokers.

Whoa.

I don't like people or science, either,

but ain't nothing wrong
with a righteous doob.

We need to show the world
that we will not tolerate

these deviants and these
degenerates any longer!

I don't want to be
associated with these people.

The gays will hate us forever,
and when I get an interior,

I want it decorated.

People watching everywhere,

meet the two new faces of family.

You know what we have to do, right?

On the count of three.

One, two...

Look away, Peggy!

Hold me, Terry.

I believe this is yours.

I can't keep up with all these drinks.

I'm running out of tiny umbrellas.

How will you get home if it rains?

Yes, it's I.

Saw your kiss on Instagram,

and I wanted to apologize
for the whole mix-up.

I can be a little overly sensitive.

Just ask anyone that works at LancÃ´me.

Oh, they know me at LancÃ´me.

They call me No More Free Samples.

Listen, I get it.

Nobody wants to be
reduced to some label.

You should hate people
for other reasons:

because they're gross or mean

or you owe them money.

At the end of the day,

we are all just trying to get by.

Bi? Now, those people I don't trust.

Hi, sorry I'm late for the party, girls,

but I was just outside
talking to my new friends,

Lisa Newcar and Ginger Vitis.

We all wear the same shoe size!

Ah, ladies, ladies.

I would love to stay and celebrate,

but I've got a hot date
with that fine young thing

at table four.

Good for you, Earl.

But I don't know if
that's exactly a woman.

Ladies, I'm almost 80.

I don't know that that's
exactly a problem.

A few of the girls and I
took up a collection

for shutting your business
down the last couple days,

so here.

Cher, you got me a present?

I've waited for this my whole life.

You know my name is Chad, right?

So snap out of it!

Max, can you watch my tables
while I run to the restroom?

I already am.

I've been watching model girl

pretend she's eating for 30 minutes.

Oh, she's nice.

She always tips
on what she would've eaten.

Guess what, everyone?

I have a secret.

You're a woman trapped in a man's body?

No.

You're a man trapped in a woman's body?

You're a little boy

trapped in a little girl's body?

I am a man in a man's body.

We're not talking about your night life.

I have discovered something when going over

the employee applications.

Okay, perhaps I never worked
at the Waldorf Astoria,

but I did work with this guy,
Waldorf, in Astoria.

It's not you. Tomorrow is Caroline's birthday.

Why wouldn't I know that?

She tells me everything about her life.

I know so much about her cycle,

I'm feeling pressure to impregnate her.

I can do that for you.

It's weird.

Why wouldn't she want
to celebrate her birthday?

She celebrates everything.

Heads up, everybody.

I just refilled the paper towels.

Who's a team player? What, what?

Max.

You know what we have to do.

Aw, man. I knew this day would come.

All right, what's the least
amount I can do to keep my job?

Just tell me when it's over.

You have to throw her a party.

I'd rather you just

have your tiny way with me.

I don't like birthdays.
I don't even know when mine is.

My mom narrowed it down
to a two-week window in June.

But you are Caroline's BFF.

And it is BFF's job
to throw friend a party.

Han, I don't have enough money

to throw a party.

I don't even have enough money
to throw a baseball.

You have money. You be her BFF.

I already have a BFF-- Jamarcus.

And my last birthday,

he threw me a sick surprise party.

You must think BFF stands
for "barely freaking friends",

because there's no way you're down

with someone named Jamarcus.

Oh, really?

Then why did we exchange
ATM pin numbers?

Oh...

I'll just crop that, and we'll be good to go.

Max, Edwin's ready to show us
the design for our new website.

Come see it.

Dude, you and the webmaster
have been talking "business"

every day for a week.

Is something going on there?

Shouldn't the web be mastered by now?

It's strictly business.

All right, but it's costing us $200.

Might as well get something out of it.

Maybe let him browse your Yahoo?

Looks like he might have
a big ol' hard drive

with a lot of ram.

Yeah, he's cute, but I don't
want a relationship right now.

And I don't do one-night stands.

All right, so don't stand. Lay down.

That's not me--

the next morning,
doing the walk of shame.

I always see those girls
with their messed-up sex hair,

carrying their heels,
clutching their coats

to hide last night's outfit.

Going into Kinko's to use Google maps

so you can figure out where you are.

You really put the "ho" in "Kinko."

Oh. Sorry, Sophie.

We're closed.

Oh, no. I'll be quick.

I just want a cupcake to go.

I'm on my way to 24 hour fitness.

Ja, and I put it on the cupcake
holder on the treadmill.

Uh, Max,
my town car is parked out front

and I was wondering
if you wanted me to wait

for you and Caroline to give you
a ride back to our building.

Oh, no. It's okay.

We still have to clean up
and take the garbage out.

Oh.

Oh, looks like the garbage
is taking itself out.

The game continues.

Here is my number.

I invite you to call me

when you realize what a catch I am.

Or any time you are drunk and willing.

Max, I'm going to need the doggy bag as well.

Not for the cupcake.

To puke in.

So I'll get this finalized,

and then I'll stop
by the diner tomorrow

so you can sign off on
the layout before we go live.

This is so exciting.

Oh, wait, Edwin. Shoot.

I forgot to show you
the new pricing chart.

It's cool, I can draft it up right now

and upload it when I get home.

Yeah, webmaster. You work pretty fast.

But I bet you can work slow, too.

And really fast again.

I can be done in a minute.

Ooh, not what you want to hear.

Max.

It's fine. We can wait.

You know what? You stay here.

I have to go to the store
and pick up stuff for your--

my what?

Your cupcake business that
you're making me do with you.

Get home safe.

Um, hey, where do you live, Edwin?

Hell's kitchen.

Oh, cool.

You're going to want
to take the "c" down,

transfer to the "l,"
and if you get lost,

there's a Kinko's on 6th and 14th.

That's embarrassing. Max was just trying to--

yeah, I work on complicated web programs.

I think I cracked that code.

She wants us to hook up.

Yeah. I'm sorry.

Why are you sorry?

That's all I've been thinking about.

Yum, yum.

Oh, my God.

They are so hot.

Don't give me that look.

Oleg.

Caroline.

What are you doing here?

What are you doing here?

I live here, and I'm just coming out

from going to get coffee.

It was delicious.
I drank every bit of it.

Outside. That's why I don't have a cup.

But you're wearing
the same outfit from last night.

You're wearing the same outfit
from last night.

And you have messed-up sex hair.

You have messed-up sex hair.

Webmaster?

Sophie?

She called me up and we made hand love.

But I thought Sophie hated you.

Well, she doesn't hate my hand.

But you cannot tell anyone.

That was her one condition.

That and a copy
of my recent blood tests

signed by a medical professional.

Deal.

And you can't tell
anyone about me, either.

Especially Max.

I'd never hear the end of it.

Deal.

Pinky swear?

Actually, never mind.

I don't know where
your fingers have been.

I just told you where they've been.

Max

I'm so excited for this party.

I wore my loose clothing
so I can dance all night.

God, I cannot take this party pressure.

I'm just going to go in the back

and run a can opener across my wrist.

Oh, Max. I'm sure you did a great job.

You know, as long as you have a DJ,

some champagne, and a psychic.

No, no, and no.

I got some balloons, a hummus tray,

and possibly Earl.

He still hasn't confirmed.

Oh.

You don't need psychic to know

that this is going to be
a horrible, horrible party.

Well, thank God
Caroline has new boy toy.

She might not mind as much.

What are you talking about?

Yeah, I saw them kissing in
front of the diner last night.

Yeah, I sat there
and watched for an hour.

They were really going at it,
hot and heavy.

You know, like the Showtime
network in the good old days.

Oh, great.

Now I have to invite him
to the party, too?

I only got a six-pack of Capri Suns,

so people are going to have to share.

Congratulations, it's official.

Our website is now live.

Congratulations, it's official.

You're a whore.

I hear you got
your Kinko's card punched.

What?

Don't "what" me.

I know you hooked up
with the webmaster.

Pick up.

Oleg, you told Max?

What's happening?

Our deal's off.

Oleg had sex with Sophie last night.

No...

It wasn't sex. Just hand stuff.

Yeah, and nothing above the waist.

I'm a lady.

I got all hot and bothered
watching Caroline and big Han.

Okay...

You know, I really think
this is between Caroline and me.

You mean between Caroline,
you, and your strippers.

Strippers?

I have seen this man in a strip club.

Han, you were in a strip club?

Earl took me.

Damn it, Han.

You're going to sell me out

after I spotted you $100 in ones.

You went to Spreaders without me?

Why would you take Han to a strip club?

Yeah, is his lap even big enough for a dance?

Earl, I'm so disappointed in you.

That's it. I'm not going to your party.

What party?

Damn it, Earl!

It's supposed to be
a surprise for her birthday.

Who told you it was my birthday?

Han.

Damn it, Han!

I didn't want a party

and I don't want to celebrate
my birthday this year.

Well, too bad,

because your BFF is throwing you
a big blow-out.

Oh, Max. Now I feel bad.

You feel bad now, wait till you see the party.

Caroline's birthday. Woot, woot.

Thanks, but you don't have
to say that after everything.

Max...

I know you had limited budget,

but music is free.

Yeah, well, I'm a douche.

Speech!

Speech!

I can't carry this party much longer.

Okay, I'd like to say something.

Wait, wait.

Can't we wait till we cut the cake?

Cake?

People are still doing that?

Yes. Our livelihood depends on it.

There's only one party as bad as this one.

That's the Donner Party.

And even they had better food.

I'd like to say happy birthday
to a very pretty lady

who I just had the pleasure of meeting,

and I think I'm going
to be seeing a lot more of her.

Aw.

I'll go get us some more drinks.

Okay.

Get rid of him.

What?

It was a one-time thing.

I thought you weren't that kind of girl.

I realized it had almost been a year

since I had sex, and I decided

I rather not be that kind of girl.

But I don't want a relationship.

Hey, I get it. Hit it and quit it.

♪ hit it, don't babysit it ♪

Max, please.

Fine.

How am I going to make him go away?

It's not going to take a lot

to convince someone
to leave this party.

I'd like to ask everyone
to raise their cocktail,

but I can't.

So raise your Capri to the sun...

For a very special lady who I'm
sure I will be seeing more of.

Get rid of him. It was a one-time thing.

So was that the worst party
you've ever been to?

That was the worst party
anyone's ever been to.

So with the webmaster, how was the sex?

Pretty good.

But then he did that thing

where he pretended
he was going to choke me.

When did guys start doing that?

I don't know,

but if I knew that was his thing,

I would've asked him
to choke me at the party.

How did you get rid of him?

What did you say?
Did you let him down gently?

No, I told him to hit the pike.

It's a one-night stand. Guys get that.

So that's it? He wasn't upset?

Guys don't care.

One-night stands-- they come, they go.

Literally.

But what if he wants to see me again?

Relax.

It is not going
to come back to haunt you.

Unless you start feeling an itch...

Or a kick.

Well, thanks for dumping him.

And for the...

I'm going to go ahead
and call it a party.

I knew you wouldn't want me

to use any of the cupcake money,

and I was broke.

So I guess I am your BFF--

your broke friend forever.

Max, it really doesn't matter
what you would've done.

The only thing
I really wanted for my birthday

was to see my father.

And he's in prison,
so that didn't happen.

I may not be a good BFF,

I may not throw a great party,

but I do know where
to find a free bus to prison.

Hey, everybody.
We got a birthday girl onboard.

Sit yo ass back down!

See? Now we got a party.

This is nice getting out of the city.

Kind of reminds me
of the ride to the Hamptons.

Yo.

This your first time on the bangbus?

We call it the bangbus because
everybody here gonna get banged.

And in addition 'cause we're on a bus.

Hmm, makes sense.

Hey, I'm Shonda.

I'm Max. This is Caroline.

So you're all going for,
like, conjugal visits?

Pretty fancy term for getting

shawshanked on a three-legged cot.

Shawshanked. I like her.

I like your hair.

Did you just get back from Cancun?

No, no.

I saved up,
and I got these done for my man.

He says they make me

look like Alicia Keys meets Ed Norton

in American History X.

How sweet.

Ah, yo. What's your man in for?

My man's in for possession
of a sweet, sweet ass.

He makes that joke every time.

He's not my man, actually. He's my dad.

Oh, so you're a freak.

That's all right. I don't judge.

You see a name tag
on me that says "Judy"?

Oh, look. We just passed a Carvel.

What's a Carvel?

Carvel ice cream.

You know,
Fudgie the Whale, Cookie Puss.

Come on, how could you not know Carvel?

They have them everywhere.

Oh, wait.

Is that that white trash ice cream?

How dare you!

It is not white trash.

And I wouldn't be so high and mighty.

You're on a free bangbus to a prison.

I'm sorry.

I didn't realize you had such

a strong emotional connection
to ice cream.

Not to the ice cream. The ice cream cake.

When I was ten, I asked my mom
for a birthday party.

She said yes but then flaked out

and forgot to call anyone.

I'm starting to understand why

you don't like birthday parties.

So after I waited on the porch for an hour,

I'll stole 20 bucks from her purse,

thumbed it out to Carvel,

and bought myself
a Fudgie the Whale cake.

Ate the whole thing
with a pink plastic spoon,

and it was way better than
any party ever could have been.

I heard that.

There ain't nothing better
than Fudgie the Whale.

I love the chocolate crunchies.

Bitch, everybody love
the damn chocolate crunchies!

Hey, Shonda. Who are you here to see?

Who's available?

I'm just cracking wise.
You know I'm here to see Squirm.

Search her.

Damn. Is it my turn again?

Next.

We're not on that list. We didn't call ahead.

Leave it to me.

I've gotten into every club
I've ever wanted to get into.

Hi. Caroline Channing plus one.

I don't see you on the list.

Really? That's weird.

We should be on the list.
We're always on the list.

Max, we're not on the list.

We're not? I'm going to kill my assistant.

Oh, I know.

It might be under Deangelo Jefferson.

Come on, girls. Don't waste my time.

I'd like to see a manager.

There's no manager.

It's a prison.

Well, then who runs this place?

Well, the Aryan brotherhood
is getting pretty strong.

This is such amateur hour.

Give me 50 bucks for the door guy.

Are you seriously trying to bribe

an officer of the law
while inside a prison?

That's a federal offense.

Is it?

Probably.

Look, I should have you thrown
out for even suggesting it.

We do not accept bribes.

Okay, fine.

I'll let you take
your sweet time searching me

on the way in.

These two are clear to go through.

Max, you can't do that for me.

It's really for me. It's been a while.

Woot, woot.

I'm so excited to see my father

after all this time.

How do I look?

You look good. How do I look?

Do I still have
that freshly felt-up glow?

Well, that ginger over there
thinks you look good.

He's full-on staring at you.

Well, I should hope so.

If you can't get a dude
in prison to check you out,

it's time for a makeover.

No, he's looking
and nodding like he knows you.

Never seen him before in my life.

Max?

Max Black?

It's me, Irish.

I don't know, dude.
I think you got the wrong girl.

Max, I could never forget that face.

Trust me, you've never seen me before.

Oh, damn!

Oh, my God!

That's you.

So you do remember.

Of course.

Get rid of him.
It was a one-night stand.

See, they do come back to haunt you.

Shirt on.

Max, can you believe it?

Of all the prisons in all the world,

you walked into mine.

It's kismet.

I got rid of yours. You get rid of mine.

Listen, Irish. It was a one-time thing.

You're a guy. You get that.

How could you say it's a one-time thing?

I love you.

I blew up that chipotle for you.

Listen, I appreciate the ink,

but I don't really believe in love,

and truth be told,

I'm not even a fan of Mexican food.

Caroline Channing. This table.

Max, we have to go. My dad's coming.

Okay. Nice to see you, Irish.

Your body looks sick.

Max, hold on.

I'm not going to tell you again to back up.

Max, I'm not going to lose you twice.

I said, back up!

Don't tell me to back up.

That's the love of my life.

Come on, dude. Hit the pike.

Calm down.

Don't tell me to calm down!

Visiting hours are over! Everybody out!

No, no, no, wait! I can't leave.

Damn!

Oh, wait. There's my father.

I can see him, he's just coming in.

Oh, daddy. Daddy...
Hi!

Well, thank you very much, ladies.

My man was barely in
when I got pulled out.

I would like to apologize to everyone

for taking the bang out of the bus,

but in my own defense,

everyone here knows a little
something about crazy guys.

Sit yo ass back down!

Max, sit down before you start another riot.

I'm sorry. I blew it.

I screwed up your chance
to see your father.

I screwed up your party.

I even screwed up the
easiest birthday thing to do,

like get a cake.

I'm a terrible BFF.

It's okay.

Really, it's fine.

With the year I'm having,

it's not like you could've
made everything better

just by getting me a cake.

Well, no. Not just any cake.

Just as good as I remember it.

Best 40 bucks we ever spent.

And this birthday turned out
to be all right.

I did get what I wanted.

I got see my father.

It was only for a second,
but I saw him.

And he saw me. So thank you.

Yeah, and I got to see Irish.

Think he might be
the one that got away.

Well, the one that got put away.

You know, you and I are better than BFFs.

We're BBFs.

Bangbus friends.

Oh, hey.

You ready?

I can't. I just can't.

Everyone feels like that the
first few times you eat here.

It's like heroin.

It makes you sick,
and you think,

"I'll never do that again,"
and here we are.

No, we put our project
on Kckstarter,

and we're getting
major funding right now.

And I can't. I just can't.

Kickstarter...
that's the website

where strangers
give money for crap

that no one in the real world
would invest in, right?

Exactly, but our project isn't crap.
It's bananas.

We design candles with arms.

I can't. I just can't.

Don't you have
a passion project...

something you've
always wanted to do?

Yeah, you can't just want to
be a waitress your whole life.

[Chuckles] Actually... I do
have a Kckstarter idea.

I'd like to start
kicking your asses!

You know we work
for tips, right?

Yeah. This one
got away from me.

okay, listen up, it's Tuesday,

I have a dream.

Tonight you will do side work.

Hold up, girl. I have ten
minutes till my shift starts.

Max, that is not appropriate.

I'm your boss.
Don't call me "girl."

Yes, ma'am.

Okay, you want to play?
I'll play.

Hey, sir. Hey, big Manny man.

Why don't you show me
your penis?

Han, you know
I don't have a penis.

It's the only thing
we have in common.

Where's Caroline?

In the back
at our cupcake shop.

Why you don't open
your walk-up window

till you close here at night?

She's getting a jump
on our side work.

What? We can't do
ours and yours.

Relax, Marjorie.

Keep it up, Max, and one day
I will show you my penis.

And you'll be sorry.

Yes. Yes, I will.

That's it! New rule!

No more making fun
of the boss!

Han doesn't want us
calling him names anymore.

It's like, if you don't
want to be called names,

don't look like that.

Oh, my God.
Did you see that rack?

See it? I have to carry it
around all day.

I've been wearing
the same clothes

every day for two years.

Now, I know that's
your dream scenario,

but to me, it's a horror show.

Go get new clothes.

Just go to the place
around the corner

and buy some cheap ones.

Max, they sell clothes
by the pound.

That's why it's called
the fashion pound,

and that is why it is awesome.

Look, I'm willing to cut
a lot of other things,

including my wrists,
but I need quality clothes.

The only reason I've been able
to wear these pants every day

is because they're quality.

Well, that and a lot of
febreze, which reminds me...

I used to smell like money.

Now I smell like pennies.

And, Max, you need a hit.

'Breze me.

Hi, girls.

Did you see the high-fashion
model shoot?

I was too short to be
a model in Poland.

Well, I guess you can't
have it all, right?

Do I smell febreze?

That's my
second-favorite scent.

Oh, and there's
my first-favorite scent.

Hey, Sophie.

I'm sorry. Have we met?

I'm not good with faces that
I never want to see again.

What happened?

I thought you guys
were gonna be friends.

Yeah, messed-up,
passive-aggressive friends

who occasionally
sleep together,

like Ryan Seacrest
and Simon Cowell.

Oh, okay, I see
what you're doing.

You're pretending
like we don't have

movie-character names
for our private parts.

Well, good-bye, miss,

and give my regards
to Mrs. Doubtfire.

Okay, E.T., go home!

Here's your mail, girls.

Max, Sophie had a new purse.

Everybody has something new.

Even the homeless lady on
the bus had a new barrette,

and even though
her feet were split open,

I still felt jealous.

Oh, this is not a bill.

Now, that's a first.

"We are offering you
a new phone,

"as older flip-model phones
such as yours

have been degraded."

They're
slut-shaming phones now?

I don't want a new anything.

And I like my old flip.

Where's my damn letter
from the pants company,

saying, "girl,
those things are tired..."

here's a new pair for free"?

If you want something
for free,

why don't you just go on
Kckstarter like everyone else?

You can't use it for clothes.

Can you?

And if you can, can I?

Why not? It's no stupider
than candle arms.

Now, if the candles
had real arms

and could slap
the idiots who bought them,

I'd invest in that.

Max, we have nothing,

and if anybody is giving us
something for free,

we're taking it.

You are getting
that free phone,

and I am begging
for free clothes.

Things are looking up.

[Pants rip]

You might want to Kickstart
some underwear.

Well, obviously,
they don't have anything.

Let's go.

Max, stop. My pants
just ripped some more.

I have to fix them again.

[Stapler clicks]

Hey, quality, why don't
you just take them

to Office Depot
and get them tailored?

Let's shop.

Ow.

Uh-oh, they're ripping again.

I feel a breeze
up in my febreze.

How can I help you?

Oh, hey. Hi, uh, Cchiandra.

Where can I get
a new flip phone?

Mm, let me think.

Guatemala.

I'll miss you, phone.
This is breaking my heart.

Come on, boo.

It's a phone, not Bruno Mars.

Now, I need that letter.

Oh, here it is. I have it.

It's in my purse.

What's her story?

Why is her hand on her ass?

Her staples popped.

Lap band?

Happened to my cousin.

She had a diet 7 up
and exploded.

Then she got M.S.

According to judge Joe brown,
it was not related.

Uh, here,
I'll just take this one.

Slow down, now.
Take a look around.

You got a whole world
of possibilities.

Pick 'em up, get a feel, hold
it in your hand for a while.

Chiandra, it's a phone,
not Bruno Mars.

Oh, "Texting is easy"

with the new
finger friendly keyboard."

My fingers are already
too friendly.

Ask my fourth-grade boyfriend.

Wow. These sample texts
are getting kind of racy.

"Bad news... I think
the condom broke last night."

Why would anyone put that
on a display model?

That's mine.

I left it there by accident.

But that's not your problem.

Now, tell me,
what are your phone needs?

Uh, my needs are simple.

I need a phone that can draw
a mustache on people

and occasionally will call
my mother and hang up.

And she needs one
with a good camera,

because I have to film
my video pitch for new pants.

I have a hole in my butt.

You know
you're supposed to, right?

[Stapler clicks]

Max, I might be
a virgin again.

I love my new phone!

It's so cool and red.

It feels like
anything could happen!

But it probably won't.

[Phone ringing] My first call.

What do I do?

What do I do?

Oh. Hello?

Oh, hey, girl,
good for you. Bye.

Chiandra's not pregnant.

Max, why are you taking calls
from Cchiandra?

We have to do my video.

I had to take her call.

She gave me a bunch
of free apps...

Angry Birds, Doodle Jump.

If you want to look like
a dog, I could do that.

Look, here's me
as a St. Bernard.

See my neck keg?

Okay, I've done some research,

and here's some things
other people want money for.

One woman wants money
for a new leg.

Scrolling.

Wait. If she only has one leg,

shouldn't she be
on can't-Kckstarter?

Oh, I'm no longer
working with them.

They denied my project.

Apparently, I'm not artsy
enough and have too many legs.

So now I'm
on go fund yourself.

Oh, perfect.

I've been telling you
to go fund yourself for years.

The future of my pants
hinges on the video pitch.

The tone needs to be
sad and pathetic.

Uh, preparation done.

What's sadder than former
billionaire Caroline Channing

asking for money for pants?

Oh, they're not
gonna know it's me.

Are you being funded
by Al-Qaeda?

If they're buying, I'm taking.

And action.

Hi. I can't tell you my name,

and I can't show you my face
because I'm too ashamed.

Sadly, I find myself
in a situation

where I am no longer
able to provide myself

with the garments I need
in order to be the best

in my day-to-day life.

I'm aware that this is
not a problem for everybody.

Stop, stop! I need to take
a picture of myself

having the most fun
I've ever had.

Your nose is coming
out of your eyehole.

No.

No, no, no, Max, don't stop.

I'm in a groove.

No, you're in a bag.

Please let me take
a picture of you in a bag

and then turn it into a dog
and then call it a doggie bag.

Go, Max, I'm running
out of oxygen,

and I think there
was cheese in here.

And action.

If I achieve my goal...

specifically, a new pair
of quality pants...

then I promise I will give
back to the community,

wearing said pants.

All I need is $1,500.

Stop! Whoa! $1,500?

How many pounds of clothes
are you getting?

Look, it's for one pair

of amazing dries van Noten silk
brocade pants... super cute.

And, yes, it's a lot,

but my investors will get
something in return.

For $5, they will get

the feeling of goodwill
in their heart.

Pbbt!

For $10,
I'll send them a selfie

in the new pants
that they bought.

For $20, I'll send them
a selfie without pants.

Nobody is gonna give you money
for the stuff you offered.

"Goodwill in their hearts"?

This is the Internet.
We're animals.

You're right.

[Gasps] I have an idea.

Camera up.

And action.

I'm sure a lot of you
are probably thinking,

"look at this spoiled,
indulgent, clueless girl."

Well, I am.

And you're also
probably thinking,

"God, I want to slap her."

Well, guess what. You can!

For $500, you can come here

and slap my spoiled,
clueless face.

And cut.

Pretty good, huh?

Genius. Now, here,
take the camera.

I want to film my video
to raise $500 to slap you.

Earl, look!

I just got 20 more dollars
from one of my backers!

Now, let me get this straight.

You just ask people for money,
and they give it to you...

without using a weapon?

Well, Earl, I guess desperation
cuts like a knife.

Man, being white is easy.

[Game sound effects]

Um, we're ready to order.

[Fanfare plays]

[Game sound effects]

[Fanfare plays]

Caroline, I just unlocked
the candy hammer.

Can you go over there
and take those girls' orders?

I can't. I just can't.

[Bell clangs]

Oh, no way! I just hit $1,000!

That's almost
both legs paid for!

Uh, hello?

You're dinging and donging
right in front of my face.

Can't you at least
put your phones on vibrate?

I don't like to mix
business with pleasure.

You two need to be
off your phones and working.

Now. And no back talk.

[Phone chimes]

Totally.

[Phone chimes]

Totally.

[Phones chime]

- Totally.
- Totally.

[Both laugh]

Oh, I know what's going on.

You're group-texting
insults about me!

We are not.

[Laughs] I got your text!

Han does look like those Minion
things in despicable me!

Oh.

And I thought bullying would end
when I hit four feet.

[Bell clangs]

Oh! Oh, my God!

I'm getting my new pants!

I just got a $500 pledge!

Somebody wants to slap me!
Somebody wants to slap me!

Just one person?

Hey, han insists we can't leave
tonight without doing our side work,

so I made him into a chihuahua
wearing a diaper.

[Laughs] Check your phone.

No, I was.

but I was secretly worried
my Booty was gone.

Turns out,
it was just the pants.

It's still there.
Take a picture of it.

Okay, let me see.

[Gasps] Perfect!

Now, let's send a group-text
to our diner family,

and I'd like you
to copy me on that,

because I want to send it
to my dad in prison.

He'll be so proud.

Yeah, 'cause I'm sure he's
not seeing any asses there.

You know what I love
about these pants?

How they make my butt look...

can you see it
through the window?

I got new pants.

[Phone chimes]

Hey, Earl,
you got my text, right?

You mean that picture
of Caroline in her pants

that said,
"I'm so sick of her"?

I know, right?

If she ever gets
a new shirt, just kill me.

I hear you, Max,
but I just can't believe

you included her on the text.

[Laughs] Yeah.

What?

Oh, my God.
I didn't take her off the chain.

I mean, if you're
gonna trash a child,

you got to take her
off the chain.

Look, Earl, they're here!

Look what your $10
is buying you!

Uh-uh, not looking.
Don't want to know.

I'm taking myself
off the chain.

Uh, hey, Caroline.

Uh, did you get my text?
Not yet.

The front of the diner
is a bad reception area.

[Phone chimes]
Uh, no, no, no, no.

Don't reach for that.

It's probably
just an Amber alert.

Why are you acting weird?

Oh, are you jealous
of my new pants?

No, but I may have texted
something about you

that I didn't mean,

so just please
don't look at your phone.

Uh, okay.

If it's something bad,
I don't want to see it anyway.

She's gonna look at it,
isn't she, Earl?

I would.

She just did.

You're so sick of me?

[Laughs] 'Cause it's funny!

[Laughs] "I'm so sick of you!"

[Laughs] You know, said funny.

You know how I am.
Ask Earl. Earl, help.

Oh, I am off the chain.

Oleg, help.

I'll be in my car.

Oh, look, look! Here's han!

He knows how I'm always
just joking.

Han, nod your head
and don't ask why.

Oh, no, last time you
asked me to do that,

I wound up on a date
with an albino.

And who didn't call who back?

I don't know how
they're so confident.

Max, you said
you were sick of me.

Oh, why are you so upset?

I say worse things
to you all the time.

Yesterday I said
you were sad and pathetic.

But that was to my face.

I can't believe you talk
about me behind my back.

It's bad. I am sorry.
What can I do?

Hit me. Punch me.
Tell my mother where I live.

Congratulations, Max.

Now you're like
all my old girlfriends,

talking behind my back.

Stop looking at that.
Delete it.

This is not what I think. I'm
not sick of you. Really?

'Cause when I see it in writing,
it feels like you are.

It's not me. It's this phone.

It brought out the ugliness
that was kind of already there.

[Sizzling] There!

I killed it
because it hurt you.

I swear I didn't mean it.
You have to believe me.

It's fine, Max.

I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

There...
I French-fried my phone.

What else can I do?

I mean, really,
it is technology's fault.

It's turning us
against each other.

Caroline, I swear,
I will never accidentally say

anything about you again
that I never meant.

I have to get ready for work.
It's fine.

Stop saying that.

Please stop saying it's fine.

"Fine" doesn't mean fine.

The scale goes great,
good, okay,

not okay, I hate you, fine.

If "fine" meant fine,
that'd be great,

but it doesn't, okay?

You're right. It's not fine.

It sucks. I'm hurt.

You're the one person
I care most about.

No, you are the one person
I care the most about.

Well, right now
it doesn't feel that way.

It has to feel that way!

You are my best friend,
Caroline!

I love you.

Oh, my God, now I'm
really gonna throw up.

Max, is that the first time
you said "I love you"?

Don't look at me.
I'm embarrassed.

Now what do we do?

So you're not sick of me?

You are the only person
in the entire world

I am not sick of.

Caroline...

There's a woman here who said
she paid to slap you.

If I had known
it was an option,

I would have thrown my name
into that hat.

Well, time to put this on.
That's my $500 pledge.

I'll go. What?

I'll take it. I deserve it.

You've already gotten
a slap in the face from me.

But she's expecting to see me.

No, she's expecting
to see a clueless woman

wearing a paper bag.

And even though
I wasn't planning

on becoming that woman for
another 20, 25 years, I owe you.

Seriously?
You're not gonna stop me?

Nope.

And, Max... I love you too.

I'm so sick of you.


[Cash register bell dings]

[Rap music]

Max, that car has been parked
outside for a week now.

Do you think they're selling drugs?
Let me rephrase that.

Are they selling drugs
to you?

No. They're not
buying, either.

Hi. We have a new
mochaccino cupcake.

Oh, no. No, no, no.
That car's not with us.

Well, that's the third customer that
didn't stop because of that rap car.

To be fair, this place
wasn't Walmart on Black Friday

before the car showed up.

I'm gonna go ask it to move.

Cool. I'll tell your horse
you died brave.

Stupid, but brave.

At least take this pan,
and cover the part

you wanna get shot in

Hi. Can I talk to you

I need to see your head

Second of all,

He said he wanted to talk to you about

- Han!
- I thought he was your friend.

I don't have friends

I made out with a guy

That wasn't making out.

He was choking,

Yeah, but it led to sex.
Go away.

Hey, Max, I came in

I also wanted to know if you
want to hang tomorrow night.

We could watch TV
with our shirts off.

Maybe. And I'll buy you
some dinner if you put out.

Ooh, so like a date.

I'm willing to throw
$10, $15 at this thing.

You want to throw $15
at my thing?

Great.

I usually charge $5.

You came all the way here
to ask me out?

I'm old-fashioned. Plus,
I dropped my phone in the toilet.

- See ya tomorrow.
- Okay.

Now go.
I have a job to not do.

- Okay.
- Go, idiot.

Okay, dummy.

(All)
Aww.

Okay, Han,
I can't hold you up anymore.

Max, I think I just saw the murder
car go by, out the bathroom window.

- What exactly did you see?
- A car.

No, seriously, I think
it followed me home.

Well, three years ago, you
followed me home, so we're even.

There you go, Nancy.

Okay, I'm off on my date.

You can't leave me here alone.
There's a murder car out there.

- Relax. No one is after you.
- Oh, really?

What about the person
who yelled,

"Watch yo back, bitch",
when we were walking home?

That was me,
to that girl scout.

If you tell someone
you're carrying thin mints,

you best be carrying
thin mints.

Max, you're coming back
tonight, right?

I'm kind of afraid. I've never
been here alone at night.

If you don't want to be alone,
why don't you call Han?

Very funny.

I did. Han's busy.

He's going to a country
square dance on Second Life.

It's an online game, but he says
it's more of a lifestyle.

Don't you have to have a first life
to have a second life?

Max, please stay.

Call Deke and cancel, or else you might
come home to find me in a pool of blood.

Oh, I always wanted a pool.

[Knock at door]

Oh, no, it's them,
here to kill me.

It couldn't be. I haven't paid
them all the money yet.

Oh, hi, girls.

You know, I just came
from the dentist's office.

Did you know that
Michael Jackson died?

Oh, and Farrah Fawcett too?

Oh, no, I've got to sit down.

Well, since you're here, do you want
to stay and have a girls' night?

Oh, that's sounds like fun.

It's just me and you.
Max has a date.

And Caroline's afraid
to be alone.

Well, if you don't want
to be alone,

then why do you act
the way you do?

I got to go meet Deke.

We are going out
to get wasted,

hopefully to the point of blowing
chunks on each other's shoes.

But imagine it a little
less romantic than it sounds.

Well, Caroline,
it's just me and you.

- I know. I thought it'd be fun if...
- Well, we tried.

Good night.

Don't go. Dangerous
people are after me.

You know, in Poland,
when the Cossacks came,

we would boil water and
then throw it in their faces,

and then make soup.

Anyway, have a good one.
[Cell phone ringing]

Wait.

Hello?

Rula? Yes.

No, I have absolutely nothing
to do tonight.

Well, Nancy, looks like
it's just you and me.

Yep, you and me
and this magazine from 2009.

Ah, 2009... The last year
I had anything.

Let's see, Nancy.
What are we gonna read here?

"New York City,
more dangerous than ever."

Okay, that's it.
We're done.

[Car horn honks]

That's just a horn, right?
Or is it a signal?

No offense, Nancy, but we really
need a dog in this situation.

Oh, guess what. We happen
to be in my neighborhood.

Oh, you are smooth.

Also, you aggressively
steered me here

and stopped at a bodega
to buy me condoms.

So you want to come back
to my place, and...

♪ Brown chicken
brown cow? ♪

Brown chicken what?

You know, "Bowm chicka
bowm bowm," but I made it...

♪ Brown chicken,
brown cow ♪

So you thought of that in your head, and
your brain was like, "That's okay to say"?

No, my brain was like "don't say it, don't
say it, don't say it, don't say it".

And then it was...
♪ Brown chicken, brown cow ♪

Well, this is me.

What do you want me to say...
"Congratulations. You live in a building"?

No, that would be lame.
I don't live in a building. I live here.

- Where? All I see is a dumpster.
- (Deke) Yeah, it's my apartment.

I converted it,
and I live inside.

It's totally green.

I mean, it's horrible for the environment,
but it's the color green.

Oh, you're not kidding.

You live in a dumpster?

This is usually the part
where the girl says

she has to be
up early tomorrow

or call the police.

So do you have to go?

Yeah.

I have to go inside
the freakin' cool dumpster.

And if you think
it's cool now, watch this.

My dumpster's a grower,
not a show-er.

Holy crap.
This is amazing.

You have a sink in here
and a stove.

Is it heated in here, or did you teach
the rats to shovel coal into the engine?

Yes, but there's also
solar panels on the roof

and a microwave

and a bathroom right here.

You have a microwave next to your toilet?
You're a genius!

That's the smartest way
to eat a burrito.

I think of everything.

And if you don't like your neighbors,
you push your house to a new street.

Or you could just kill them
and throw their bodies in here.

Added bonus... no rent.

And the Chinese restaurant next door
always tosses their garbage on my roof.

Free delivery, yo.

You don't have to tell me.

I read all about this place
in "Dumpster Living."

I'll take it.

All right, but it comes
with a very handsome

stuffed animal of a man with hair that
gets him followed by security at Macy's.

I'm not just saying this 'cause you live
in a dumpster, but I'll take some...

♪ Brown chicken,
brown cow ♪

Right now.
[Chuckles]

[Sighs happily]

So what was your first time
having sex in a dumpster like?

A lot like the other times
I've had sex in a dumpster.

Next time
I'm gonna be naked.

Next time
I won't be wearing this hat.

[Yawns]

I hope you don't mind.

- I sleep like this.
- Aah! Get off me.

Oh, so nice to have a live body
under me for a change.

Stop! You're crushing me! Mm.

[Chuckles]

- This is really nice.
- Yeah, it is.

I got to go.

You got to go?

Yeah, I live, uh,
all the way over by the diner.

Plus, I got to
pull these boots on.

And I got a horse and a cat,
possibly a dead roommate, so...

Right. You got to
be up early.

Yeah, but not like that.
It's just, like...

Where's the door handle?
Is it the coffee pot?

I can't get out. I'm used to
climbing out of these things.

Ah, it's right here.

Oh. Sure you
don't wanna stay?

Chinese restaurant
just delivered.

[Car horn honking]

There's that horn again. There
is no way this is not about us.

Max, it's me again. Why do you even have
a phone if you're not gonna pick it up?

And also,
you are a grown lady.

Why is your
outgoing message a fart?

[Sighs]

And I am sure you're in the middle
of having very silly sex,

but it is a nightmare
around here.

Chestnut, Nancy, and I are
all convinced

that the murder car is still circling
and about to take us all out.

[Scoffs]
So self-involved.

This water
is taking forever to boil.

The best I could do now
is offer the killers

warm tea
before they dismember me.

That'd be funny
if you got jokes.

[Car horn honks]

Okay, guys,
here's the plan.

If they come in that door,
we go out this door.

If they come in that door,
Chestnut, you block them,

and, Nancy,
you go for their eyes.

[Door rattling]

You know what? Let's just
say our good-byes now.

Boil, boil, boil.

[Door rattling]
No time!

Whoever you are, I have a pot
of pretty hot water!

Wha... oh!

[Screams]

What is all this junk?

My legs!
My beautiful legs!

Ow, ow. Ow, ow. Ow, ow.

I burned my toe cleavage.

And it's the only cleavage
I have.

If it helps,
your toes do look bigger.

Thank God I have these flip-flops I used
to wear in your shower before I gave up.

Yes, hi, I have
a complete emergency.

My legs are burned.

Okay, I hear you.

I'll put you right behind the guy
whose legs just came off.

Thank you.
I appreciate that.

See, I just got burned
with pretty hot water,

and I wear a lot
of peep-toe shoes.

- Insurance provider?
- I'd like to use my Obamacare.

Oh, Obamacare?
Why didn't you say so?

Come right in.

What is the problem?
We're all entitled to Obamacare.

That's what that
Rachel Maddow guy said.

I'll need more information
than that.

Password, Malia?

You clowns need to figure out
your insurance information

and come back to me in about
two hours when I'm on my sofa,

drinking whiskey
out of a coffee mug.

- Max, let's just sit.
- They have to take us, by law.

I know because I used
to complain about that.

Max, can you take that flu season
pamphlet and fan my feet?

No.

I'm not touching anything in here,
'cause I was never vaccinated...

Or loved.

[Phone ringing]

- Who is it?
- It's Deke.

You're not gonna answer it?

No, right now, I am very
concerned about your legs.

Aw. You're lying.

What happened
between you and Deke?

Why did you even
come home tonight?

Was the sex bad?

[Sighs]

Did you hit him?

No, the sex was fine.

Actually, it was better than fine.
It was great and I wanted to stay.

- So...?
- So I left immediately.

Max, don't take this
the wrong way,

but it sounds like
you found someone

who finally makes you happy
and you're trying to ruin it.

Oh, that's what this feeling is.
Well, I got to get rid of it.

- Why?
- I wasn't raised to be happy.

I was raised to believe canned
meat is as good as it gets.

Ow, ow. Ow, ow.
Ow, ow.

Earl, I spilled hot water on my feet.
You can't imagine how much pain I'm in.

Well, I kicked heroin in
a 7/11 bathroom for three days.

But sorry about
your burnt tootsies though.

Caroline,
sorry I didn't text you back.

I would've come over last night, but
my second life wife had a baby.

I just can't believe you had fake sex
nine months ago and didn't tell anyone.

Excuse me.

I'm looking for a skinny blonde
that works here.

Uh... She died.

- She right over there.
- Ooh, she came back to life!

Hallelujah!

Hey, I got something
for you.

[Gasps]
No!

- It's a mix tape.
- No!

I made it for you. I'm sorry
my brother threw that cupcake at you.

He's gluten-free
and upset about it.

So can I take you out
sometime?

Uh... uh, very sweet,
and you seem great,

but I'm already in a relationship
with a guy in a red bandana.

No worries.
Just thought I'd ask.

What did you just do?

You never say no to a guy
with tinted windows.

That's rule number two.

Well, his number's on here.
I can always call him back.

Then we can both be in relationships
we don't want to be in.

- Relationship?
- Deke.

You're gonna see him at pastry school
tomorrow. He's gonna wanna know.

Guys never wanna know. In fact,
they are dying not to know.

Max, why'd you leave last night?
I wanna know.

I mean, you were all like,
"Wham-bam, thank you, man."

And yeah, my brain was like,
"don't say it,

don't say it,
don't say it, don't say it,"

but I said it.

What's going on?

Uh... The sex was bad.

What about the scratches
on my back?

I was trying to get away.

I'll just
leave you two alone.

Ow, ow. Ow, ow.

I'll just be over here,
looking at my mix tape.

Oh, track one,
"Make It Nasty."

You're right, Max.

The sex was bad,
really bad.

And it was worse when
we did it the second time.

And that third time
was a disaster.

I mean, I only lasted 47 minutes,
and you screamed.

Okay, walking away has to be
less painful than hearing this.

- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
- No, stay, Caroline. We'll go outside.

Max, come with me for a second.
I wanna show you something.

Just whip it out here.

You wouldn't be the first guy
to do that tonight.

Nor will he be the last.

Okay, what do you
wanna show me?

Is that your dumpster?

Look, you said you couldn't stay over
because you lived all the way

over by the diner,
so I moved it here

to figure out what
your next excuse would be.

Um, I'm racist.

Yeah, me too.
White girls are a hassle.

What else?

You have a bird
on your shirt.

You love it.

I do.

What else?

- I got nothin'.
- Good.

So what do you say you stop
being such a stupid face,

and get your sweet dumper
into my dumpster right now,

where a brown chicken and a brown cow
are waiting patiently for you.

Look.

If you want me in that dumpster, you'll
have to get me there the traditional way.

Duct tape my wrists, throw a bag
over my head, and toss me in.

- Awful, huh?
- So bad.

Want to do it again later, and then sleep
over tonight, and then do it again?

Sure.

Are we ever
gonna do it naked?

Yeah, when you move into a place big
enough for me to take my pants off.

Look, I got to warn you.
I don't know how to be happy.

Then why do you have
that big smile on your face?

I'm faking it.

Why is it shaking?
Are we still having sex?

Thank you, sir.
Enjoy your cupcake.

Hey!

Max?

Don't tow us.
This is Deke's house.

He lives in a dumpster?

Yeah, but on purpose.

But you're coming home
tonight, right?

Max, Max!

Han?

Han, what are you
doing tonight?

Synced by dcdah & Reef


Here you go, Earl.

Table 12 throwing down
a credit card on a patty melt.

They really need
those eight airline miles?

Where they going... New Jersey?

Credit cards are the downfall of America.

Well, credit cards and Kim Kardashian.

I like her big ass
as much as the next man,

but don't go give
the damn butt a franchise.

Max, I can take a lot.

Please keep your sex life to yourself.

I handled it
when I lost my fortune,

and I handled it
when I lost my fortune.

You said that twice.

Because I think it bears repeating.

But this is too much.

That couple that just left...
a $50 check, a $1.47 tip.

47 cents?

Uh, I wasn't even aware they
were still making pennies.

I smiled and bent over
backwards, giving them service...

all for $1.47?

This makes me the lowest-paid
hooker in New York.

All right, give me that check.
I'll handle this.

Hey!

Was something wrong with the service

my girl over here gave you?

No. Tipping's an option.

So is me spitting in your food.

You might want to remember that

the next time you leave
a waitress pennies.

I'm sorry. I didn't know.

This was our first
and last date.

Sorry, dude.

Looks like this little tip

just lost you the chance
to give her your little tip.

Max, come in, sit down.

There's something
we have to talk about.

This can't be about my drinking.

I don't have the money
to be a real alcoholic.

Can you sit in that chair, please?

I never sit in that chair.

Well, today we're doing things differently...

And I went to Starbucks

and got you a coffee
and a vanilla bear claw.

A Bear Claw? Awesome!
I'll sit anywhere you want.

My life is not where I want it to be.

That $1.47 tip
was a wake-up call

reminding me that life
will always undervalue you

if you let it.

Yes, I've been knocked down,

but now it's time to fight back
and grab life by the balls.

I don't know if life likes
having its balls grabbed.

Some guys do, but those
are usually the ones

who want you to spoon them.

I'd like to explain
my vision for our future

by walking you through...

My vision board.

- Oh, no.
- It's a simple tool.

You're a simple tool.

You start with a thin, white board...

Your thin, white, and I'm bored.

Keep going.
I can do this all day.

I have a Bear Claw in me.

I've been making
vision boards for years,

and I always achieve my goals.

And you think
it's that crazy little board

and not your father's billions?

- Max, it works.

You put up pictures
and inspirational words

of things you want in your life.

See? I have success,
a cupcake business,

and a picture
of a beautiful new bed.

Ah, the ones at the Asylum
look different than that,

so don't get attached.

Sleeping on that couch
is holding me back.

I never get
a restful night's sleep,

and I need a good nine hours.

What you need
is a good nine inches.

That should be
on your vision board.

It is... on the back.

Nice.

Now, unless you're willing
to switch the bedroom

every other week...

No, that sounds mormon.

Then I want to install
a murphy bed in here.

The bed folds up against
the wall during the day,

so you'd still maintain
your signature Williamsburg

"I don't care about anything
chic or nice" decor.

Who's going to build it?
'Cause it's not me.

I'm already
being taken advantage of

at my babysitting job.

Peach has me lugging things
back and forth

to help with the twins'
first birthday party.

I've been sorting through
clown resumes for a week.

Peach is throwing a birthday party?

Did you ask her
if we can cater the desserts?

She hires fancy people
with real companies.

We're not a real business.

See? This is what I'm talking about.

You mock the vision board, but look...

here it is, our cupcake shop.

I don't think we can both
fit in there.

Max, you have to start imagining

what our life can be.

You deserve a cupcake shop,
and I deserve a new bed.

All you have to do is dream it.

No, all you have to do is do it.

And for you to build
a Murphy bed,

it'll take a miracle.

So unless you have Jesus
or Jesus

on that board...

Not going to happen.

Who is it?

It's Jesus...

From Williamsburg hardware.

We got your do-it-yourself
Murphy bed.

See how I made that happen?

Vision.

So which one of them
has the nine inches?

Guess what I did today?

Jesus?

What do you think?

I think the bed still isn't built.

No, but it's almost finished.

Look...

Notice anything different
about me?

I have answer.

You had boob job.

Your "b"s
have turned into "c"s,

and for that,
I give you an "a."

No, I had my uniform altered.

Yes, life dealt me a bad uniform,

but with a little vision,

I can shape it
the way it works best for me.

That should be a tip
in your inspirational book,

which I'm guessing is called

cutting pictures
out of magazines

isn't just
for serial killers anymore.

And this is exciting... look.

The other really important thing
I did today...

made us business cards.

Now you can give one to Peach

and throw our hat
into the party ring.

You're her babysitter.
You already have a connection.

Yeah, a connection
to her babies' asses.

See? That's your limited vision.

Plus, Peach is interviewing
this gay guy

who used to work
for Martha Stewart.

I mean, gay, Martha Stewart...
we can't top that.

Just give her the cards.
We have to start somewhere.

See?
"Max's homemade cupcakes."

And look...
"Max Black, owner/baker."

"Owner/baker"?

That's pretty cool.

See? There it is.

It's real.

But the name sucks a big one.

"Homemade"...
it sounds like homeschooled,

like we're churning out
cupcakes

that aren't comfortable
around other people.

Or it sounds delicious.

And the cupcake on the card
has a cherry on it.

My cupcakes
don't have a cherry...

haven't since I was 13.

If you could really get
under his shoulder blades...

that's where he carries
all his stress.

Don't say your real thoughts.

Don't say your real thoughts.

Max, we're using our spa voice today.

Use my spa voice?
Okay.

I can't afford this.

I want you to make sure

the twins drink lots of water after,

you know, to flush out
the toxins.

Toxins?

All they drink is breast milk.

I can't be sure
what the woman I buy that from

puts in her body.

We're all so tense
about the birthday party.

If everything isn't perfect,

how will they live
with the shame?

Um, Peach, um...

Speaking of the... the party,

uh, I-I started this,
um, thing,

and it's probably dumb, but...

I don't need it.
Like, I'm fine.

I don't need it.
It's just more like...

like a... like a...
Favor.

Um, but, uh, the thing is,
there's the cards,

so I was thinking may...
"maybly"...

"maybly"? What's that?
It's not a word, right?

- I was not saying a word.
- I'm sorry.

I'm done with whatever this is
that you're doing.

I have to go meet
the Martha Stewart queen

and hear his party pitch.

Just remember,

at 3:00, the twins
have their spray tans.

Well, that's exactly
how I envisioned that.

Let me see
what you're drawing, Johnny.

A rat with a civil war hat.

Is that your comment on how
politicians view soldiers?

No, it's an actual rat
I saw wearing a hat.

See, when you tend bar
till 4:00 a.m.,

you see a lot of weird stuff.

And when you waitress
till 2:00,

you see a loser
drawing a rat on a napkin.

Now sign it, please.

Hmm.

You realize my art won't be
worth anything till I'm dead?

Why do you think
I keep inviting you here to eat

week after week?

Question...

how does it feel
to be the owner

of an original piece
of napkin art

worth roughly...

Less than the worth
of the napkin?

Well, I got to get
back to work.

All right, bye.

Pick up... table ten.

I watch you over there.

Much sexual tension
with deadbeat bartender.

He's not just a bartender.
He's a street artist.

And all I did was bite
a piece of celery.

When I think of all the times
I asked you to bite my celery...

And nothing.

Okay, my side work's done,
and my tables are all caught up.

So, tell me,
did you give Peach the card?

No, I didn't.

- Why?
- It was like

my mouth wouldn't
let me do it.

That's crazy.

What's so hard
about going up to Peach

and saying,
"good afternoon, Peach."

"Exciting news...
I started a cupcake business."

"Here's our card."

"Please pass them out
to all your friends,

and help us launch our exciting
new business venture."

"Thank you."

That sounds needy,

like when someone asks you
to come to their one-woman show.

"Somebody date-raped me,

and I didn't think
I'd live through it,

but I did,
and now I'm stronger,

and, uh, still needy."

There is nothing needy
about having a quality product

and wanting it out there.

Look at Earl... he has a CD on display.

Yeah, but he's cool about it.

He doesn't get all
late-night infomercial

and shove them
down people's throats.

Earl?

How many CDs have you sold
at the diner?

Well, in this current economy...

It's been pretty light.

- May I?
- Mm-hmm.

Hi.

You guys
look like music lovers.

This is the best saxophone CD
you will ever hear...

recorded by our cashier Earl Samson.

He's played
with all the greats...

Coltrane, Hancock,
even Bacharach.

His music career derailed
due to a heroin addiction,

but now he's clean and sober

and, at 83,
still following his dream.

Only $9.95 a copy.
Who'd like one?

Thank you!

Earl, four CDs.

Is any of that true?

Nope. She even made up
my damn last name.

That girl can sell.

Oh! Max...

Will you come
look at Brangelina?

I think the spray-tan lady
went a little too far.

I wanted them to look tan,
not foreign.

A little lebanese,

but that'll clear up
in a day or two.

I'm having the worst day.

Jessica Seinfeld stole
the Martha Stewart boy.

I am so upset with her.

I thought we were pretending
to be friends.

And now I have no one
to do the desserts.

- Hello, Peach, exciting news...

I have a cupcake business.
They're really good.

Give these to your friends
and help launch

a new business
or whatever.

That's it. I did it.
Boom!

Okay, the bed still isn't built.

But the mattress came,
and it's so good.

Oh, no... this is not okay.

We're not keeping a mattress
on the floor.

We're poor,
not crackheads.

And you tricked me.

I did my part,
so you better get this bed done.

Max, you gave Peach the cards.

I'm so proud of you.
What did she say?

No. Shut it. Do it.

Relax. The bed will be assembled

and hidden in the wall
by the end of the day,

'cause I decided to do

what cute girls
have been doing for centuries.

I asked a guy for help.

You called a guy?

Oh, is he going to climb up
your long blonde hair

and rescue you
from your murphy-bed tower?

Wait.
You don't know any guys.

Who did you invite?

- Johnny.
- No. No, no, no, no.

Eh, I don't want to see Johnny.

I had a weird thing with him
at the diner last night.

I thought you guys were friends.

I don't know what we are.

He was fake interviewing me
with a celery stalk...

'Cause you're both grown-ups.

And when he put it
near my mouth,

I thought he wanted me
to bite it, so I...

- You bit it?
- I bit it!

- That is weird
and humiliating and hot.

Yes, yes, and, yes.
Call him right now!

He can't come over here.
Look around!

I have his napkins
hanging up everywhere.

He'll think I'm dexter.

Don't answer that.

- Don't you...
- Come on in, Johnny.

Yes, I did it.
I need a bed.

You are so selfish!

Yes, I'm selfish,
and you're Dexter.

So, quick... help me take down the napkins.

Oh, god, there are so many!

How come I never noticed
how many there were before?

I don't know.
Same reason you didn't notice

your father stealing
everybody's money.

Really? Really?
Now when I'm helping you?

You're right.
We'll trash you later.

Why don't you just ask him
what the celery moment meant?

I don't want to ask him.

You don't want to ask
anybody anything.

It's not like the business cards.

What am I going to say?

"Good afternoon, Johnny."

"Exciting news... I have started

an oddly sexual
celery-biting business."

Be right there, Johnny!

Yo.

So I brought tools...
per your request...

and beer, I made
an executive decision on.

So that's what you do
with my art.

Just one, and I put it up there.

She doesn't even like it... she's like,

"why would anyone hang up
stupid napkin art?"

Right off my back.

Had a couple of these
on the subway.

So here's the wood.

You can't help her...

she needs to learn a lesson
about doing things for herself.

She thinks we're her daddy,
and we'll go back on our word,

and she'll get a pony.

Well, you can see
why she'd think that.

I'm going to see
if the horse wants a beer.

Hmm, maybe put my glasses on him...

get crazy up in this piece!

When you're out there,
ask him what the celery meant.

Get busy, princess.
Daddy's got company.

Well, little lady,
I reckon a cowboy'd get used to

a pretty sweet setup like this.

It's a hard life
out on the trails.

Yeah, it's hard
for my people, too,

since you stole all our land

and gave us blankets
covered in smallpox.

I do declare,

I'm sorry
for the disease blankets.

But they did
keep you warm, I bet,

until they killed you, that is.

"I do declare" is not cowboy.

That's Southern Belle.

I think you're looking
for "darn tootin'"

or "dag nab it."

Cowboys did not say "dag nab it."

Yeah, they did.

"Someone done gone stole
my horse, dag nab it."

I think you're thinking "doggone it."

No, "dag nab it"... cowboy.

Do you really think you know
cowboy better than me?

Which one of us has a horse?

Which one of us has assless chaps?

Should I go inside
and help Caroline?

No. I'm sure she's doing just fine.

Can I ask you something?

Sure.

When you put the sss...

we should get on the horse!

- Okay.
- Yeah!

Use three-inch lag screw

to secure ledger board
to wall studs

"aboot" every 12 inches.

Ooh! Your canadian voice is so dull,

I can't understand
a word you're saying.

There's got to be a video
with a better voice.

"How to build a Murphy bed... Morgan Freeman."

Interesting bit of information about horses...

they hurt your balls.

Yeah, mine hurt, too.

You would think after all these years

of riding a horse,
man would have evolved

to have his balls on top
instead of underneath.

Life would be so much easier.

Well, yeah, but I don't see
a lot of old-timey ladies

wanting to get
with the top balls.

Are you thinking
about the celery?

No, I'm still thinking about my balls.

Now I'm thinking about the celery.

That was weird, right?

Not weird, really... more, um, intense.

Intense good or intense bad?

Intense intense.

Whoo.

Whoa. Oh. Did I just grab your...

yeah, I don't know.
"Maybly."

"Maybly"!
That's not a word, right?

- I should...
- I got to get down.

Me too.

My balls.

So take your makeup brush,

take your mirror,
and you want to comb

your eyebrows upwards.

What are you doing?

Okay, okay.

I thought I typed in "Morgan Freeman."

But I'm so tired,
what came up was "more gay men""

but this damon guy is a genius.

If he had a video
on how to build a Murphy bed,

it'd already be done.

Wait. Where's Johnny?

What happened?
Did you ask him?

No, he left.

Out the back?

Yeah, it got even weirder.

He grabbed my boob.

Or... he didn't grab my...

he grabbed my boob.

I just don't know
whether it was on purpose.

But I asked,
like you told me to,

and now I have
a weird boob moment

to go with my weird
celery moment.

That is very complicated.

But I'm great
with relationship stuff.

So come on over here,
and we'll hammer it all out

while we hammer this all out.

Come on, this is
where you break down

and finally help me
build the bed.

No, this is where I go
to my already-built bed.

And after Peaches today and...

Whatever that was out there
with my boob,

I'm not showing anyone
my cards anymore...

business or personal.

Go in!

Go in! Oh!

What is happening out here?

That's the kind of pounding
that's supposed to happen

after you're in the bed.

I can't do it.

I tried.
I really did, but I can't.

I guess I can't do anything
without my father's money.

You were right.

Trying is embarrassing.

So I'm not going to try
anymore.

I'm sick of it.

I'm going to sleep on that horrible couch

and get bad tips
and cry

every waitress day
for the rest of my life.

Daddy, please.

God, you're a baby.

Okay, I'll help you...
this one time only.

And we're not going
to bond when we do it.

We're not going to high-five
when we finish.

And I don't want to hear
two months from now,

"hey, remember that night
we built the Murphy bed?

That was awesome."
None of that. Got it?

We need the power drill,

1/4-inch bit,
some masonry screws,

and a Bear Claw.

Now delete "eyebrows,"

type in "Murphy bed,"
and let's build this mother.

I can't believe we did it.

Yeah, it looks pretty good.

Oh, Max.

You put the bakery up
on your vision beam.

Say anything more,
and I'll take it down.

Do you know this number?

That's Peach.

- Why would she call you?
- It's about

the cupcake business...
my number's on the card.

Put it on speaker.

Hello?

I found your card
in my baby's room.

I have no idea who you are
or how it got there,

but I'm throwing
a birthday party in a week,

and I thought cupcakes
might be fun.

Oh, they are.

People love cupcakes.

They bring a sense
of whimsy and nostalgia.

That's enough.

Why don't you tell me

some of the other events
you've done?

Oh, well,
we're a start-up company.

Oh, no,
I need a real business.

Bye-bye.

Well, there you go...
complete waste of our time.

See?
Trying is embarrassing.

No. That was great, incredible.

What? She hung up on you.

Yes. But it proves one thing.

The cards... they worked!

This is so inspiring.

First we build a Murphy bed,
next a cupcake business,

then, Max...

Who knows what else?

Uh, adjust the springs?

No, that's perfect.

Look at that.
Dogs in the diner.

Where are we, Paris?

'Cause if we are, I'm gonna
stop wearing deodorant.

Did you guys see
that adorable dog?

You mean the one leaking
rabies all over the table

while people
are trying to eat?

She said
he's allowed to be in here.

He's her registered
emotional companion.

Her registered
full-of-crap what?

He's got one of those
official vests that says

"don't pet me,
I'm working."

I have a shirt that says
"federal bikini inspector,"

but there is simply no such
branch of the U.S. government.

Hi, so, uh,
what the hell is this?

Excuse me?
I don't understand.

Dogs aren't allowed
in the diner.

Oh, he's legally allowed
to be here.

He's my registered
emotional companion.

You mean you don't
have a boyfriend.

No,
I suffer from anxiety.

You mean you don't
want to eat alone.

No, I have a note
from a doctor.

You mean you have a printer
and the Internet.

Admit it,
and the dog can stay.

It's really hard
meeting guys.

There's a good boy.
I'll get you a cookie.

Is it just me,
or does Han sound kind of sexy

when he speaks korean?

Looks like Han,
sounds like Barry White.

Who was that, Han?

Do you have a hot,
new korean girlfriend?

Yeah, someone
who really likes you

and is $1.50
for the first minute

and $2 for each
additional minute?

I was talking
to my mother!

So... yes?

I was not talking hot.
I was apologizing.

She's still angry
I left home.

Does she know you buy
your sweaters at build-a-bear?

Well, I don't know
a lot about the korean culture,

but maybe you should
stand up for yourself

and stop apologizing
to your mother.

Yeah, what do you
even have to apologize for?

You must have been
the easiest birth ever.

She could've coughed you
into a catcher's mitt.

I'm making a cappuccino,
you want one?

Nope, I can't have
any caffeine.

I have to keep my system clean.
I'm doing a drug trial tomorrow.

Max,
not one of those places

where they use you
as a Guinea pig

to test for side effects
of new drugs

that go on the market?

Or, as I like to call it,
getting paid $500

to, uh, roll
the side effects dice

and hope it lands
on hallucinations.

I would never
do something like that.

I consider
my body a temple.

Didn't I see
your "temple" eat a bag

of flaming hot cheetos
two nights ago?

And that
was a huge mistake.

I still have a little...

Burny heinie.

And besides, think of
all the people who are

lowering their cholesterol
safely because of me.

Or the people who aren't
taking klamitra because of me.

I never
heard of klamitra.

You're welcome.

I know klamitra.

Sexy black woman
who teaches my spin class.

Uh, hello, uh,
maybe you can help me.

I'm looking
for Caroline channing.

I have a legal matter
to discuss with her.

Never heard of her.
Never seen her.

- Mr. hutchinson?
- Never took an oath.

Oh, my God,
Mr. hutchinson, hi.

I haven't seen you
since my father's scandal broke

and they were dragging you
out of your law offices.

Can I hug you?
I mean, it's been so long

since I've seen anyone
from my old life.

But, uh,
not too hard.

Ever since the scandal,
I've had acid reflux.

Didn't you
used to be taller?

No, uh, prouder.

Oh, uh, Mr. hutchinson,
this is my friend, Max.

Max, this is Leo hutchinson,
one of my father's attorneys.

Oh, I've never
known a lawyer

who wasn't
court-appointed for me.

Well, except for
the ones on law & order.

Have you ever
been on that show?

No,
I'm a real lawyer.

You look like someone
who was on that show.

Are you sure
you didn't represent

the woman
who ate her child?

I've never represented
anyone who ate their child.

On law & order.

Caroline, I'm sorry
to drag you into this,

but the prosecutor is asking
for you to give a deposition

regarding
your father's case.

Anything I can do to help?
I'm pretty courtroom savvy.

I mean, I haven't seen
every episode of law & order,

just, like, 400 of them.

For instance,
the, uh, judge's hammer?

Not called a hammer.

Reflux! Oh!

Sorry.

I just... I need to
take a rylindia.

Ah, rylindia.
Does that work?

- Hmm.
- You're welcome.

Well, thank you for coming
all the way out here.

I know I'm in good hands
with you representing me.

Uh, well, Caroline, as much
as I would love to help you

and your
legal associate here,

uh, the firm won't let me
do it for free.

I mean, your father's case
bankrupted us practically,

and my standard rate
is $1,100 an hour.

You know I don't have
that kind of money.

Last week,
I gave myself a bikini wax

with duct tape
I stole from the diner.

I'm gonna need
another rylindia.

Oh, don't take two of those
in under an hour

unless you want to have
an orgasm every time you yawn.

You're welcome again.

Mr. hutchinson,
I need you to do this.

You can make this go away
as easily as possible.

Please don't
make me beg.

The floor's gross,
and my skirt's too short.

Counselor,
at this juncture,

I am going to need to
take miss channing

and have a sidebar
over near the bar bar.

How fun is this,
by the way?

I'm, like,
your lawyer now.

Oh, real fun.
About as fun as that bikini wax.

And then I had to spend $14
on neosporin.

Don't worry, I know how you
can make $500 in one night.

I've been telling her that
since she got here.

Max, I am not
doing a drug trial.

Besides,
it's not enough money anyway.

No, but after
I put in my $500,

plus we take $100
from the cupcake fund.

You would do that
for me?

You know, I always thought
we'd have to use

the cupcake money to get us
out of a legal problem.

I just thought
it'd be for you.

Me too!

Welcome aboard,
drug buddy.

I can't believe
I'm doing a drug trial.

I won't even use stevia.

It'll be fun!

Just think of it as
a middle-school sleepover.

But with drugs.

Yeah,
a middle-school sleepover.

So when
you did this before,

you never got
any side effects, right?

Well, no negative ones.
I used to be an "a" cup.

Wow, everybody
looks so normal.

This is more like
sorority row than skid row.

Hi!
I'm Katie.

Just found out
there's three to a room,

and I was wondering if you guys
have chosen a roomie yet.

Wait, there's three
in a room?

Yeah, I know.

You want to be careful
who you get.

Anyways,
I'm a self-mutilator,

and, um, I was wondering if
you could keep an eye on me.

Just wrestle anything
out of my hands that's sharp.

Uh,
you know what, Katie?

We are
self-mutilators too.

So, uh, we kind of
have our hands full.

Yeah,
we're gonna be super-busy

self-mutilating ourselves.

No worries.

Max, you should have told me
about the bed situation.

Untested experimental drugs
is one thing,

but three to a room?
That's barbaric!

It'll be fine!

We just have to pick
the right girl.

What about, uh,
the one in the raincoat?

She looks stuck-up,

like she'd talk
about herself all night.

Yeah, we already
got one of those.

What about, uh...

What about
Bob Marley shirt?

She looks like
she smells.

- Confirmed.
- Right there.

That's who we want.
She looks smart

and like she'd
mind her own business.

Hey!
What are you up to?

Nothing.
Just minding my own business.

Hey, want to be
our roommate?

Oh, I just said yes
to a self-mutilator,

but I can get out of it.

She probably
loves rejection.

All right,
ladies, listen up!

- Hey, Max!
- Hi, Toby.

Heads-up,
me, her, and, uh...

Excuse me,
what's your name?

Oh, it's cool,

we don't have to do,
like, the name thing.

A girl after my own heart!

- We're roommates.
- Got it.

Now, since most of you
have done this before,

I'll make it quick.

Half of you
will get a placebo.

The other half will be a testing
a new drug called gladiva,

and no, that's not my stage name
down at the clubs.

Okay,
possible side effects

may occur over
the next 24 to 48 hours.

They are...
Drum roll please...

Headaches,
vomiting, flatulence,

tongue-swelling,
suicidal thoughts...

I'm having some
right now.

- Itw...
- Inability to walk.

Mm, I hope we get that
'cause that's the only thing

that's gonna keep me here.

And ru...

Relentless urination.

Fatigue, seizures...

Camel toe.

I'm kidding.
That's my joke.

That's his joke.

Good,
'cause I was out the door.

Also, tg,
eb, ccs...

You want me
to explain those to you?

Not until you see one
happening to me.

And A.L.

Anal leakage.

The Grande Dame
of side effects.

Well, bottoms up.

Max, don't say that
after "anal leakage."

See? This is fun!

Getting paid to eat cookies
and play the game of life.

- Your turn.
- What's the point?

Clearly, I've already
lost the game of life

'cause I'm sitting
in a drug trial

waiting for
my "A" to "L".

Well, if your "A"
does start to "L,"

you're on the bottom bunk.

I gotta pee.

Ruh-roh.

What?

Mm,
it's probably nothing,

but she might be
experiencing ru.

What's that again?

Relentless urination.

She just said
she had to pee.

Yeah,
that's relentless.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

"Ru" sure?

Okay,
your turn to spin.

No more games.

I really want to be prepared
for this deposition.

Can you read me the questions
Mr. hutchinson sent?

Mm-hmm.

"State your full name."

Caroline Wesbox Channing.

Your middle name
is "Wesbox"?

It was
my grandfather's name.

It also might be
a side effect.

"I just slept with a dude
who gave me Wesbox!"

Max, can you just ask me
the next question?

Do you have any owledge
of investor capital

from the channing
investment group

being transferred
to offshore banks?

I had
no knowledge of it.

- You're boring.
- I'm boring?

I'm just saying,
I'd change the channel.

This is a bad one.

Max,
it's not law & order.

I'll say it isn't.

Look, tomorrow,
you gotta give them something.

Open your shirt,
hike up your skirt,

show them your Wesbox.

"Did you know anything
about your father

- "illegally siphoning funds?"
- No.

"Have you ever had
any conversations

with your father regarding
said transactions?"

No.

"Is your ass leaking
right now?"

No.

Ruh-roh.

Nope.

How we doing, ladies?

Any side effects?

Max, are you awake?

Max!

Quiet, you're gonna
wake up pissy spacek.

I can't sleep.
My hearts keeps racing.

You should tell Toby.
It's probably a side effect.

No, I'm nervous.

I can't stop thinking
about the deposition

and about my father.
Can I come down and talk?

Not a great time.
I kind of have people over.

Get in here.
What's wrong?

I'm scared
about tomorrow.

I'm scared I'm gonna say
the wrong thing

and make things worse
for my father.

Look, all you have to do
is answer the questions

as carefully as they suggested
and then throw in a wink,

forget to wear panties.
He'll be fine.

But that's the thing.

The questions don't say
anything about my father.

They're so cut and dry.

They're only asking me
details about things

I know nothing about,

and they're not interested in
the things I do know about him.

That he's warm, and funny,
and generous, and loving.

Like when I was little,
and he and I

would take our plane
to our chalet in deer valley.

Stop. You might as well
rephrase that to

"when he and I
would take our guilty

to our guilty
in guilty valley."

Every morning,
before we went skiing,

he would get up
really early and make me

his snowflake
cinnamon french toast.

Sounds amazing.

And as he dusted
the cinnamon and sugar on top,

he'd say,
"look, sweetheart, it's snowing,

snowing just for you."

And then he'd cut it
into these little pieces...

See? I can't even
get the words out.

No one will ever hear them.
No one will know.

I'll know.
I heard them.

Another round?

Yeah, I'm just gonna
bring my pillow in there.

I don't think Gladiva's
gonna make it to the market.

We'll be doing
the deposition in here.

Oh, wow, this is exactly
how it looks on law & order!

Ooh! Ooh!

There's the tiny
typewriter thing

where the actress
who never gets to speak sits!

Leo, Leo, take my picture
near the tiny typewriter.

Ladies, ladies.
We only have an hour.

We're already behind
because you were late.

Sorry, we had to stop
at the check-cashing place.

Yeah, and then a store
to get diapers for a friend.

There, $1,000.

No fuss,
and luckily, no muss.

Max, do you have
the $100 from the cupcakes?

Yeah.

Uh, 40... 60...
80... 90...

5, 6, 7, and...

100.

Mr. hutchinson,
are you having reflux?

No, I-it just became clear
to me what I do for a living.

Okay, uh, Caroline,

if you're ready,
I can bring them in.

Remember,
just stick to the questions

and don't embellish.

I prepped her
last night, Leo.

All right,
let's go, Max.

Actually,
I want her to stay.

I'm nervous,
and she makes me feel better.

Yes, I'm her registered
emotional companion.

Well, this is
a legal proceeding,

and that's
a highly unusual request.

But not improbable.
We googled it.

Yeah, she's allowed to have
an emotional companion,

as long as
both attorneys agree.

Well, I graduated
top of my class at Harvard,

but since you googled it,
I'll try to make that happen.

No, I am unaware
of any of the transactions

you just mentioned.

Thank you,
miss channing.

Now, if you'll just bear with me
a little while longer,

I only have a couple more
pertinent questions.

Your voice
is unbelievable.

You could be
on law & order.

Max!

Withdrawn.

Miss channing,
do you have any knowledge

of embezzlement
of any kind taking place

at the channing
investment group?

No,
I had no knowl...

Of any su...

Could you repeat that?

Ruh-roh.

You're having
a side effect!

Tongue swelling.
Ts!

Uh, counselor,
give us one second.

What is going on?

We took drugs.

Did she just say
"we took drugs"?

Very good, Leo.
You must play charades.

Look, we did a drug trial
to get money for this.

What's the holdup,
counselor?

Just give her some water.
I had this once.

It goes away in an hour.

You said you never had

any side effects!

Oh, please.
I died once.

I just didn't want
to scare you.

Miss channing,
are you aware of any accounts

opened under any names
other than your father's?

Just drink the water.

One sec.

Uh, does anyone have
a napkin or a bib?

$1,100, you gotta have a bib
around here somewhere.

All right,
what's going on here?

I was just, uh,
informed my client

was part of a drug test
within the last 24 hours.

Drug test, Leo?
That's a good one.

Just another
rich girl on drugs.

Get her into rehab,
and we'll have to reschedule.

We'll have to do this
another time.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

No, no!
She's right!

We don't have the money
to do this another Tim

look, I can tell you right now,
she does not know anything.

She doesn't know
about the money,

she doesn't know
about transactions.

She doesn't know
anything about anything.

We are paid up
for three more minutes,

and we are going to
use them!

She can't talk, but I know
what she would want to say.

Ladies and gentlemen
of the... room,

she would want you to know
who her father really is.

He used to make her
snow toast!

And in her words,
he was funny, smart,

and a generous lover.

Generous and loving!

Oh, sorry, yes, yes.
Generous and loving.

Now, I don't know her father,
and I have never met him...

And I would like you
to put that on the record,

actress who's never
allowed to talk...

But I do know her,
and she's an amazing person.

And her father
raised her alone,

so he must be
an amazing person too.

Well...

That accomplished nothing.

Counselor,
what do we do here?

We take a short recess
until she can speak,

and resume
the deposition, on me,

because her father
is an amazing guy, and...

That's what they would do
on law & order.

Fine,
we'll break for an hour.

Seriously, you sound like
a superhero's boss.

Max, you're the best.

I know.
I did pretty good, right?

I should've gone
to law school.

Or High School.

Permission to enter
the judge's chambers?

Permission granted.
Excuse the tubs of bleu cheese.

They're being held
as evidence

in the case
against eating here.

I wanted to thank you
for everything you did.

And I know you were gonna
buy yourself a treat

with the drug money...

Yeah, like drugs.

So I got you
a little something.

It's the complete
law & order box set!

No way!

That's not a little something.
That's, like, $500.

Or $30 on the subway.

And the guy said
most of them are in english.

Awesome!

Freezer adjourned.

Good morning. Name?

Ha! Not until I see my lawyer.

And by the way,
I was with them last night.

Max, it's just
for the spring semester.

Sorry, she watches
a lot of Lockup: Raw.

Uh, actually, I'm here
to return checks.

There is no spring semester.

The pastry school has been closed.

What?

Feel free to collect any personal items
you may have left in the workspace.

You get the weed,
I'll get the other weed.

This is insane.

How can school be suddenly closed?

Oh, good, John's here.
He'll know what happened.

What makes you think he knows?

He's a big queen, Max.

He'll know why school's closed,

and why Lady Gaga's last album failed.

Where's Chef Nicolas?

France.

With his wife.

Why is he in France?

Hmm, turns out someone in this room,

maybe someone I'm looking at
right over there,

had an affair with him and
his wife found out all about it.

Deke!

Shocking! I didn't even know
Chef Nicolas was gay!

Oh, please.

If he was gay,
I would've been all over that.

Like a gorilla on a breadstick.

Lady, we all know it wasn't Deke.

Okay, yes, yes, fine. It was me.

And my parents say
I'm loose as a goose.

But it was not an affair.

We made out once,
in six different places,

On eight different occasions,
and then I ended it.

You ended that, and you ended this!

All of this! Forget my spatulas!

Forget my whisk! It's over!

Brigadoon is over!
Thanks, Caroline!

You're acting like I'm the only one
who ever closed a pastry school down.

Can't you just
go to Deke's without me?

I'm too down in the dumps.

Then what better place
to be than in a dumpster?

And Deke said to make sure
to bring you.

And relax, it's not
a three-way situation.

When we made our three-way list,

you were at the bottom
with Taylor Swift.

Well, at least I'm with Taylor.

On the three-way list, who's above me?

Vicki what's-her-name from
Real Housewives of Orange County.

Is that the one with
all the face work?

You're gonna have
to be more specific.

Welcome, welcome.

Wipe your feet on the way out.

Deke, I'm warning you right now,

I am not in a partying mood.

Ain't no party like a Caroline party,

'cause a Caroline party don't start.

I'm heavy with guilt, and
that cheese omelet we just split.

We're not partying, but I did
snatch back the weed, 'cause I's perfect.

Good. I got it from Earl, and he says
it knocks you out so hard,

he once used it and faked death
to cash in a life insurance policy.

Well, we might need
to do that too after what I did.

Deke, I am so sorry about all of this.

I am filled with regret
and those home fries I just ate.

We all so sad
pastry school got all closed.

We don't know what to do.

I know what to do.

Eat the pound cake in my purse.

Okay, so we all loved
the pastry school, right?

Eh, it was all right. No big deal.

No big deal? We had sex in like
every classroom and both stairwells.

And on Caroline's desk,
but, eh, no big deal.

Eh,� kind of a big deal.

Was it a Tuesday, on top of
the New York Times?

And did you eat
my cranberry clif bar after?

'Cause I made someone cry about that.

Okay, yes, it was fun.

But it's over, and that's life.

Pastry school, no pastry school,
eh, no big deal.

I'm gonna buy it.

What?

Yes!

Yes, I love that frickin' place!

We had sex on your desk
while eating your clif bar.

It was awesome there!

Deke, what are you talking about?

I'll ask my parents
to buy it as an investment.

Caroline, you can run the school.

You're already killing it
in the office.

And Max and I can
be the badass students

who won't take guff
from no damn teachers.

How 'bout you stuff
the cannoli again, bitch?

I own the damn place!

Wait, is this even possible?

I mean, it'll cost millions.

Who cares? He's rich!

Now I get the whole idea
of money. It's lovely!

It's the greatest idea ever!

I know!

And since we're doing it
together, you'll both

have to come meet my parents.

Max, they've been asking
to meet my girlfriend anyway.

Meet your parents?

Eh, the pastry school wasn't all that.

The elevator opens right
in your apartment?

Nope, don't belong here.
Hold the doors, bub!

We're okay. Thank you, James.

Max, just do the opposite
of everything you would normally do.

I already am. I'm here!

Deke, hello.

Go, be warm.

Hello, Mrs. Bromberg. I'm Max.

I'm the housekeeper.

This is Iris.
Been with us for years.

Well, it was a lovely hug.

I'll tell your parents
that you've arrived.

So, what, Max?

You think any black woman you
see here could be my mother?

Well, any white man I see
anywhere could be my father.

Let's go. I already screwed up.

No, you heard Iris.
It was a lovely hug.

But then again, she is being paid.

Here, better wear my pearls.

Yeah, right!

Me in those pearls is like
a monkey in baby clothes.

Just plain wrong.

Relax, Max.

What, are you crazy, touching me?

Your mother comes in here
right now, and she's like,

Oh, there she is, the hooker
from the projects,

getting it on with our son in the...

What, fancy-ass book room?

Deke, you have a warhol soup can?

Uh, yeah, it used to be in my bedroom.

It got moved out here after I
scotch-taped a Star Wars poster over it.

Okay, okay.

See, now, here is something
we have in common.

I used to drink that soup.

I can talk about that.

Perfect, yeah.

- Talk about that.
- Yeah.

Okay, see, when my mother
was on a bender,

I would bust open the can
on the kitchen counter

'cause I could never find
the opener 'cause she'd use

the sharp tip of it
to clean out her hash pipe.

- Give her the damn pearls.
- Give me the damn pearls.

It's just a little help.

A signal to the rich people

that says, "I'm one of you."

Like seeing another hells angel
wearing a vest

with a patch that says, "Suck it, pig."

Well, Deke better give me a signal
when his actual mom comes in,

because the way I'm going,
I'd hug Oprah.

Oprah doesn't like to be hugged.

A mistake I made at her legends ball.

One hug and 20 minutes later,

my place setting was moved
next to La Toya Jackson.

- Oh.
- Mm.

Thanks, girl.

You're Max.

I'm Deke's mother, Genet.

Uh, mom, this is our friend, Caroline.

Thank you for inviting us.

Amazing art collection.

Oh, thank you.

I'm afraid my husband and I
are pop art junkies.

I eat soup.

Speaking of my husband...

- David!
- "I eat soup"�?

He was right behind me.

Oh, sometimes I swear,

I should just leave
a trail of bread crumbs.

That's funny.

Okay, hold on a second there, folks.

I'm just sending some business emails.

Actually, I'm not.

I'm looking at celebrities

without their makeup,
and I gotta say,

Hugh Jackman?
Better without makeup.

Mwah!

I'll take that.

All right.

And what's in your mouth?

- Sour ball.
- Give it to me, please.

Genet, I'm a grown man.
I can have a sour ball.

You asked me to help you
stop eating candy.

- It's just one sour ball.
- Spit it out.

- I can't.
- Why not?

It's a Mini 3 Musketeers.

There he is!

There's my son,

Until we get the results
of the paternity test back.

I love him!

Ugh, hey, come on.

No tongue in front of my girlfriend.

Max, come over here.

Fine, but no tongue till after dessert.

"No tongue till after dessert."

She's pretty and funny.

Who's your bodyguard?

Oh, um...

This is my friend...

Mm, help me out. Totally blanked.

Oh, she's a little nervous.

Hello, Mr. Bromberg. I'm Caroline.

Drink before dinner, yes?

Yes, but just one.

But not because I'm pregnant!
What?

Sit, let's talk.

Yes, let's sit down,

Have a nice conversation,
get to know each other better.

So, tell me about pastry school.

Yes, tell us about pastry school.

Well, we went to class
the other day and it was closed,

And John, this big, gay
pastry chef, was freaking out.

Max does a great impression of him.

No. No, I don't.

Yes, Max, it's really funny
and totally charming.

Oh, uh, okay.

Uh, he's like 6'5"...

Stand. You gotta stand.

Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

And he had his arms up
in the air like this...

Um, I think his arms were down.

No, they were totally over his head.

Yeah, she's right, they were down.

Way down, like a crocodile.

Or CeeLo.

What are you talking about?

They were way up here.

Way over his head, and...

Oh, yea... They were down.

Whoo! You know what?

I think he was sitting,

and was really quiet.

Excuse me, I have to use
the powder room.

- Max, would you come with me?
- Try and stop me.

Max, it's over here.

We're not making a break for it?

Trapped. Trapped like rats.

What is wrong with you?

Why are you sweating so much?

I think we'd be better off
just wetting the whole dress.

I know.
It must be the pearls.

My white trash body is working
overtime to reject them.

Ooh, okay. Raise your arms.

Why bother?
They already hate me.

Max, they do not hate you.

Well, they will.

This is Tommy Dolan all over again.

Who's Tommy Dolan?

And FYI, great upper arm workout.

He's this rich kid
I liked in eighth grade.

And by rich, I mean his family
could afford the acne medicine.

He asked me out, but his parents
said no because I was poor.

And, to be clear, that was
before I shot the ten BBs

into their front picture window.

Max, you're not in eighth grade.

This is a grown-up relationship.

Tonight's not just about
a pastry school,

It's about you and Deke,
so get it together.

You have a lot on the line,
and I have a neck cramp.

Ladies, it's Genet.

Trapped.
Trapped like more rats.

Is everything all right in here?

I didn't take anything.

I...

Caroline, do you mind
if I speak to Max, alone?

Our neighbors have just stopped by.

They've opened a bottle of champagne.

It's French, wonderful. Enjoy.

Girl, you need to chill.

Um... Uh, excuse me?

You have got us all wrong.

You walk in here,
see this fabulous apartment,

and all of this "fabulosity",
and you think...

You think I'm some rich bitch.

I am.

But I wasn't born that way.
Uh-uh.

I am from Queens, New York.

Yeah, that's right,
I'm just Genet from the block.

Wait, then how did you get

your own elevator and fish wallpaper?

Well, when David met me,
I was a dancer.

Oh, you mean like on Broadway?

Yeah, well, close to Broadway.

The point is that we fell
in love so completely

that I even stopped taking
his money after the third visit.

Tell us, Deke,

why a pastry school of all things?

Who cares? We're just thrilled
he's no longer in the circus.

- Girls...
- I didn't take anything.

Ha. Amy and Adam have lived
in the building since Deke was little.

Mom, don't tell Max I'm little.

I've convinced her I've got
the biggest one she'll ever have.

Oh, Deke!

Naughty, dirty, funny.

Andy and I love naughty comedy.

We watch Bill Maher.

This pastry school would be
a huge financial commitment, David.

Why don't you just go down to Union Square
and light a bag of money on fire?

Mr. Chase, I agree,
it's a huge undertaking.

And if you'd like,
we can discuss a business plan.

I did graduate top of my class
from Wharton.

Wharton. In Philadelphia.

The city of brotherly love.

And let me tell you, it certainly is.

Our son, Hunter, went to Wharton.

He's about your age.

I'll text and tell him we've met you.

What is your last name, Caroline?

Um...

Channing.

Caroline Channing?

Your father isn't Martin Channing,
the one in prison for the Ponzi Scheme?

Amazing fish!
I-I love this tilapia.

It's almost a chicken-y fish.

Deke, you never told us about this.

What, that the fish was chicken-y?

You know that's why
I don't come home anymore.

Why would I tell you?

She didn't steal the money, he did.

Deke does have a point.

It wasn't Caroline,
and her father is serving time.

Ah, speaking of serving,
there are like nine forks here.

Where do I go next?

It's easy for you to say, Deke.
You didn't lose money.

Amy and I had to move from the
penthouse to the fourth floor.

The fourth floor, Deke!

That's three above the doorman.

Only five bedrooms, and I can
hear the "whoosh-whoosh"

of the damn elevator all night long!

Oh. Shh, shh.

Genet, I cannot believe you would
invite a Channing into your home.

Sir, if you say another
bad word about her,

I'm gonna "whoosh-whoosh"
you off that chair.

Max, these are our friends.

Yeah, well she is my friend,
and she's had it pretty rough.

And I'm not gonna sit here
and let them insult her.

Oh, you only have five bedrooms?

Well, she sleeps in the wall.

You rich people are all the same.

Max, take it down.

You're gonna "whoosh" you did later.

No, Deke.
I mean, look at this table.

Seven forks and ten knives, for what?

You know what we have
at our apartment?

Five chopsticks and a spork
from Kentucky Fried Chicken,

and we do fine.

We don't need to sit here
and gravel...

- Grovel.
- Whatever.

For your money or their approval.

All I can say is,
you rich people are lucky

those cops took my BB gun.
Let's go, Caroline.

No, this is my fault. I'll go.

No, you know what?
We'll all go.

Deacon, sit down.

You are not leaving
the table with them.

I go where she goes.

Except not in the bathroom, because
we like to leave a little mystery.

I mean, what is the big deal, anyway?

You have a problem with her
because of her father,

but no problem with his mom
being a stripper?

What? You were a stripper?

Mom?

Max!

Oh, is that not common knowledge?

I feel so bad.

Don't. I should have guessed.

My mom's way too limber at tennis.

And it totally makes me
respect my dad more.

A Jew marrying
a black woman is impressive.

Marrying a black stripper is awesome.

No, I feel bad about your parents
cutting you off financially.

But you're okay with outing my mom?

Look, they gave me a choice,
my money or you.

It only took me two hours
to decide, and I picked you.

I wish it took you two hours.

You didn't even think it over.

You were out of there immediately.

Deke, how are you gonna live
without money?

Hey, I already live in a dumpster.

I'm used to roughing it.

Who bought the dumpster?

They did.

Who bought the solar panels
on the roof?

They did.

But I bought that cool
skateboard poster.

Deke.

Okay, it was in a box of Honeycomb.

And who bought the Honeycomb?

They did.
Max, it'll be fun.

Oh, come on.
How hard could it be?

Look, I get up tomorrow,
I get a job here,

Zippity-boo, get another job there.

Now I got 20,000, then zippity-pow,

make another 20,000, zippity-zang.

Then I'm lousy with Honeycomb.

Now, cheechity-chong,
where did I put Earl's weed?

What's the emergency?
Are you all right?

I'm fine, but Deke's insane!

He thinks he can make it
as a poor person.

You never know, I did.

Sure, the first...
What's today, Monday?

Sure, the first thousand days
were hard, but...

Deke is nothing like you!

You are resilient and smart
and creative and driven.

No one could do what you did.
You're amazing.

Max, that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

Oh, don't get all wet.

You're still at the bottom
of the three-way list.

My point is, I can't let Deke
give up his money.

It's his decision.

And it's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

It's crap!

I care about Deke more than
I have ever cared about anyone,

so I have to give him back.

I just called his mother.

At 2:00 A.M.,
and she picked up the phone?

Oh, right, I forgot.
She was a stripper.

She's used to picking things up
at night.

And she said they'd take Deke back,

but he has to come to them.

That's great.

So, come on.

You and I are pushing him home...

In the dumpster.

Pushing it to the upper east side?

Yes!

He's totally knocked out
on Earl's weed.

He will not feel a thing.

Come on, help me push right now
before I realize what I'm losing,

and change my mind.
Go!

You take that side, I'll take this,

and we won't stop till we're there

or one of us falls off
the Brooklyn Bridge.

We can never get it there, Max.

Then we'll get it as far as we can,

and then at least when Deke wakes up

he won't be stuck here with me
in the morning,

and he can have a life.

I was wrong earlier.

This is the most romantic thing
I've ever seen.

Yeah, don't cut yourself
on the dumpster

Or you'll get lockjaw.
Push.

Oh, Max.

Even better upper arm workout!

See, only you would say that.

Synced and corrected by backinblack


Max, the guy is coming right now.

That's the first time anyone's ever been
polite enough to announce that to me.

Yeah, hilarious, sex is messy.

Now hurry!

Let's get these cupcakes to the
window before that guy gets here,

and when he does, Max,
don't turn around.

Why?

You know why.

And here we are on the much traveled

Bedford Street right in the very heart

of historic Williamsburg.

This guy is so boring.

He's like a roofy with a little flag.

During the 1830s, German
and Austrian capitalists

established their businesses

here in historic Williamsburg Brooklyn.

And, in honor of those
German and Austrian

founding fathers, here we have our

Williamsburg beer-batter cupcake.

Oof-yah, beer batter! It's good!

Wow, you're pushing harder than I was

after I ate that whole brick of cheese.

Soon, docks, shipyards,
refineries, mills,

and other booming businesses opened

along the growing waterfront.

Businesses just like
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

See, made in Williamsburg.

Only 12.95, 100% cotton.

And I'm guessing cotton oof-ya, ees good!

Actually, I was referencing
booming Williamsburg businesses.

This is one of those small
Williamsburg businesses

that won't be here much longer.

Follow me.

Oh, sir, no, a free dessert
comes with your end-of-tour meal

at the Ye Olde Williamsburg
Watering Hole Restaurant.

Don't waste your Euros.

How dare he tell those people
our business won't be here.

I haven't been this speechless
since the first time

I saw your toe nails.

Who cares what he thinks?

We had such a good
month, I had enough cash

to buy my own box of S'mores Pop-Tarts,

a goal I've had since I was 11.

My other goal was making it to 12.

By the way, you heard I referenced

the Pop-Tarts as "my own box," right?

Max, I'm not interested in your box.

Well, not for another ten
years when we're still single.

I can't believe that tour guide

is telling people that
our cupcake business

is gonna fail.

I mean, it's one thing for you, me,

and Time Out New York to say it, but...

I just hate that tour guy.

I hate that tour guy too!

Han, oh, my God!

It took us five years, but
we finally have something

in common.

That's not true.
Aren't you both an A-cup?

Can you believe he's
telling his entire tour

that our cupcake business is gonna fail?

Just to play devil's
advocate, maybe he has

the most basic understanding
of supply and demand.

Han, don't blow this, it
might be our only connection

ever.

Who the hell does that
dickweed think he is?

Exactly.

And I hate him because
that tour never eats

in here.

He just keeps pushing his stupid

Ye Olde Williamsburg Watering Hole.

I don't want to hear anymore
about that guy's hole!

Until ten years from now
when you're still single.

Hey, everybody!

Well, it happened.

Ryan Seacrest came out?

Oh, Max, don't be silly.

No, I'm pretty sure that happened

a couple of years ago.

My biggest dream has come true.

Kentucky Fried Chicken now comes

with free hair extensions?

Okay, my second biggest dream.

I'm pregnant.

Oh, no everyone just thinks that

after they'd had the
chicken Parmesan here.

It's not official. I haven't
peed on a stick yet,

but my boobs are really, really sore.

That could be my handy-work, baby.

Well, we're about to find out in a minute

'cause I'm about to go
pee like a race whore.

Sophie, the phrase is "race horse."

Uh, not in Poland.

See, I got a whole bunch of these things

'cause, uh, my aim isn't very good.

Yeah, I have what the doctors call

"a forked stream."

Well, whichever of those
you don't use, I'll take.

It'll be nice not to throw myself

down a flight of stairs
every time I have a hunch.

Oh, all right, well.

Wish me luck, girls.

Oh, wait up, Sophie!

I'll hold the stick under
you while you urinate.

Oleg, you're gonna make a great father.

Is it even possible for
Sophie to have a baby?

I mean, didn't that window
close around the same time

Blockbuster Video did?

Well, we don't know how old she is.

Sophie's ageless, like a unicorn

or... Anderson Cooper.

Caroline, I found a city website

where we can complain
about that tour guide.

Why, what'd he do to you?

Confuse you with a historic Williamsburg

fire hydrant?

Up top!

Um, things have changed.

I'm kind of all about the
Han and me connection

right now.

Sorry, Max, you're out.

Han, complaining online doesn't work.

True, if it did, they would have replaced

my faulty Legos by now.

I say we gotta find him and
knock some sense into him.

I'm in.

That's the first time Han has
ever said that to a woman.

All right, can I just come?

That tour guide keeps going on and on

into his mic in front of
that bunch of Euro trash.

It's like Madonna on tour.

Forget this Ye Olde Williamsburg place.

Those people should be
having desserts at my diner!

Yeah, if they wanted Ye Olde Desserts,

they should have come to us.

We've got lady fingers so
old, they have arthritis.

Ooh, okay, here he comes. Get ready!

Oh, who am I kidding? I can't do this!

I'm not a violent person,
and full disclosure,

this is a Nerf bat.

Sorry, Caroline, I hope
this doesn't affect

our budding friendship/ you never know,

possible romance.

Never gonna happen.

Okay, Han's dead to me.
It's back to me and you.

Thank God. Those couple
of hours were hell.

For me too.

Hi, we need to talk to you.

I'm Caroline from Max's
Homemade Cupcakes.

Oh, yeah, right.

I didn't recognize you without...

the worst German accent I ever heard.

And you are?

Dannon.

Like the yogurt?

It's a family name.

Listen, Yoplait.

I personally don't give
a crap what you think,

but you bad-mouthing our business

is upsetting my girl here.

You got that, Activia?

Look, girls, I'm not just
talking about your business.

All the businesses on that
block are gonna close.

It's getting plowed for an IMAX theatre.

Oh, my God.

I know.

Another Max is getting
plowed on our block?

- Morning.
- Yeah.

I can't believe they're replacing us

with an IMAX.

That subway psychic told me
my business would skyrocket.

I guess this also means
I won't be a contestant

on "The Voice."

That psychic had food
all down her blouse.

She couldn't predict her mouth opening,

let alone your life.

I'm e-mailing all the
neighborhood business owners

to attend an emergency meeting
tonight at the diner.

I've contacted pretty much everyone

except that medical marijuana store.

You know, Joint Custody.

I'll call them, they're on my speed dial.

♪ Pa-boppa boppa-tarts... ♪

Yes, it was me. I stress ate them.

You ate my PPTs?

Personal Pop-Tarts.

You gave them a cute name?

Of course, I've been dreaming
about them my whole life.

I can't believe you ate the
last of my S'mores Pop-Tarts.

Fine, I'll go out and
buy you another box

with the money I was saving
for a Wet n Wild lip liner.

Well, we know that's not
opportunity knocking.

He lost my address when I moved in here.

Hi, girls.

I'm out of sugar, and can one of you read

my morning pee stick?

I can't read this little window thing

and I lost my cheaters
and Oleg's not upstairs.

So you lost both your cheaters.

Yeah, see Max?

That kind of joke is no longer funny

now that we're gonna be parents.

So no more that!

It's just not my morning.

Caroline, why don't you read it?

Might be nice to here some good news

come out of your sad mouth for a change.

Oh, just take it.

I'm pretty sure I got the worst of it.

Okay, now everybody hold
hands and get ready to cry

'cause I feel really,
really, really pregnant.

It's negative.

You're negative!

Sophie, I understand you're disappointed,

but maybe you should
manage your expectations.

Oh, man I really thought I was pregnant.

I mean, my period's real late.

How late is late?

Hashtag, just asking for a friend.

Well, I don't know.

Six months?

A year, tops.

- Well, I mean, at your age...
- Oh, careful now.

Don't be too dead to
get my new Pop-Tarts.

Exactly how old do you think I am?

Well...

If you open your mouth and say an age,

any age, there's no
coming back from that.

How old?

Well...

Oh.

Final offer.

Well, I don't know how old she is,

but I've aged since this started.

Okay, next, Cathy's Crystal Shop.

Present and accounted for,
thank the goddess.

Garboni Funeral Home?

Thanks for coming.

No thanks, I'm having my head frozen.

Bedford Methadone and Drug Clinic?

Oh.

Do you have a card?

We'll just wait for one
more business to arrive

before we start.

Oh, and thank you all for coming.

Oh, and thank you

for closing the diner
tonight for this meeting.

Oh, we're not closed.

Nope, this is a busy Thursday for us.

Oh, hi, are you here for the meeting?

Yeah, we're Smiley Time Daycare.

Well, if Sophie has a baby,
I think we found our nanny.

Okay, tonight's call to arms

is really about each and every one of us

and our dreams.

Small businesses are
and have always been

the backbone of Williamsburg.

But this is about so
much more than business.

Let me help.

I took a class in motivational speaking.

Well motivate your ass back down.

I got this.

Do you? You're losing this crowd

faster than I'm going to lose my diner.

He's right, move it along.

You make that boring crock guy
look like a sweeps episode

of "Empire."

That was just my opening.

And your closing. Thanks, Caroline.

Yes, I said yes, folks.

Yes, we are all businesses,

but we are one hell of
a lot more than that!

Impressive. It's like Tony Robbins

and a pine nut had a baby.

We are a family,

and the only way...
the only way out of this crap

is each other.

Can I get a "what-what?"

What-what!

Can I get a high-five?

High-five!

- All right!
- High-five!

I'm so jealous.

I've been dying to do that for years.

And tomorrow, we need you,

and I mean every one of you,

to join my diner family
at that public hearing

down at the Brooklyn Courthouse

and we are going to tell them

they can keep their
stinking buyout money.

Yeah!

There isn't enough money in the world

- to buyout our leases.
- Yeah.

- Han, I don't...
- Wait, they want to buy us out?

Not 20,000, not 30,000...

Dollars? I could live in India.

I wouldn't have to sell
these dumb crystals anymore.

But we are a family!

Yeah, we're a family.

Might just be us tomorrow.

With the addition of the IMAX,

I predict that the net worth

of this now dilapidated
group of businesses

will at least quadruple.

And commissioner, you don't know me,

but when it comes to finance,

when it comes to most things really,

I'm very hands on.

And also a douche.

We'll take a break and
then hear arguments

from the opposing side.

Max, I'm gonna ask you
a serious question

and I want the truth.

Is it, "Can you smell
that onion bagel on my breath,"

'cause yes.

Do you think our business dream

is as far-fetched as Sophie's baby dream?

You know Sophie's right there, right?

Don't get her mad.

I once saw her open up a can of paint

with her knees.

I mean, aren't all dreams kind of crazy?

Isn't that why they're called dreams,

'cause they're not real?

At some point, you have to
wake up and pee, right?

Sometimes five times a night.

Well, at least you won't have
to listen to that annoying

tour guide's speech twice a day anymore.

Right, if you look to your left,

you'll see a failing cupcake shop

with two completely deluded shop owners.

In fact, the only redeeming feature

in this waste of architecture are
the historic Tiffany windows

right next to those two bitches.

He says that? I totally missed that?

Yeah, because you're too
busy sprechen the cupcakes.

Oh, my God, those Tiffany windows

might be old enough to qualify us

as a historic landmark building.

Oh, oh, my God, I'll be right back.

Where are you going?

Down to the city archives.

I need proof that those
windows are legit.

If I'm not back when
it's our turn to speak,

stall them. Fill time.

Just go on an on talking about nothing.

Got it. Pretend I'm you.

But you would need a miracle
to find that proof in time.

Psst, Max, you got a tampon?

I just got my period.

Either that, or I've been shot.

Sophie can still have a baby!

See, miracles can happen!

The woman is right there.

And like I've already
said twice, Your Honor,

I've worked at that diner since 1989,

so, peace out.

She's still not back. Keep going.

Your Honor, I've been
working at that diner

since 1989.

I think we've heard everything
this gentlemen has to say

about the building in question,
including, for some reason,

of his brief affair with
comedian Nipsy Russell's wife.

She was from Brooklyn!

I thought it was pertinent, Your Honor.

If there are no other witnesses...

Han, go, go, go, go.

No, I already blew this once.

Finally, you admit you blew something

when I can't enjoy it.

Oleg, you go.

I can't. The judge knows me

from a sort of "Eyes
Wide Shut" situation.

You go.

No, nothing good ever happened to me

in a courtroom.

Every single time, they just
gave me back to my mother.

I'll go.

Yeah, I've got something to say.

You're a lady judge.

You got any Midol?

Well, if there are no
further witnesses...

Damn it, yo!

I guess I have something to say.

Wonderful.

Carmella, we just lost our lunch table.

Nice model you got there,

except IMAXs are supposed to be big.

That's kind of the point.

Miss, if you don't have
anything pertinent...

Stop, you can't tear our building down!

So excited, I feel like
I'm in "Legally Blonde."

Those Tiffany windows
are over 100 years old,

making it a historic, landmark building.

Do you have documented proof of this?

Yes, I do, your honor.

So dramatic. I'm loving it.

Living, breathing, boring proof.

Your Honor, this gentlemen is an expert

on historic Williamsburg.

Dannon, tell them about the windows.

First say it.

Say it in the eyes of
the court, or no deal.

I will never do a German accent again.

The building's windows were
created by Tiffany Studios

in a playful fish motif for
the original Williamsburg

fish market, opened at that location

in June, 1901.

Well, that qualifies as a landmark.

Yes!

Yah, dis is vuunderbar!

Well, I never promised you anything.

How do you like that, Max?

These cute little fishies
from the fish market

saved our business and the diner.

It's weird I'd wind up working
in a former fish market.

Dannon told me the
market was also a front

for a whore house.

Yeah, that's more like it.

Now I have a serious question for you

and I want you to tell me the truth.

Would it have been smarter for us

to take whatever of that buyout money

we would have forced Han
to give us and quit?

Probably.

But Max, I've wanted my own business

since I was little.

It's purely emotional.

I can't really explain it.

I can. It's your PPT.

Your personal Pop-Tart.

It is. It's my PPT.

Then I totally get it.

Yeah, you do, Max. You always do.

Well, girls, it's official.

You're still short?

We won!

The entire neighborhood
has just been notified

there is no IMAX buyout.

Yep, and they do not look happy.

Here they come.

Hey, you! Yeah, you!

- Open up!
- They have sticks!

Can't leave him out there, can we?

- Aah!
- Oh, God!

Oh!


Thank you.

That was, like,
our tenth gay guy tonight.

Let's hope our gay buzz lasts
longer than Adam Lambert’s.

Oh, it will.
I'm all over it.

And by "it," I mean
I'm all over grindr.

Max, why are you
on that app?

You're not a gay man
looking for anonymous sex.

Don't put me in a box!

You told me to find ways
to drum up business.

Well, I'm drumming it up
by showing off this guy's "bid'ness."

I pretended to be a rough and ready Puerto
Rican guy who still likes to cuddle.

That there's gay chum,
my friend.

Ooh, I hooked a big one.
Get the net.

Hi. Was a muscular
Puerto Rican guy just here?

When is there not?

Would you like to purchase
a delicious cupcake while you wait?

Well, maybe,
while I wait.

My phone says
he's right here.

Here, this is on the house, because
the muscular gay guy, that's him.

It's cool
that you're transitioning,

but you really should let people
know you're not Puerto Rican.

[Mouthing words]

Well.... He said he was 22
and butch, so I'm mad too.

Season 3, Episode 8
"And the 'It' Hole"

Synced by Reef


Earl, I need my checks
for tonight.

- Beautiful?
- Check.

- Sexy?
- Check.

- Cool?
- Check.

Sorry I'm late.

I was ten minutes early
for my shift,

so I thought "well,
I have 20 minutes to kill,"

and I wandered
into this cool surf shop

and saw this guy
polishing a surfboard.

A surfer here?

You don't hang ten in Williamsburg,
you hang yourself.

I'm with Max, the only waves we get in
Brooklyn are heat waves and crime waves.

- Earl, you never go out to the beach?
- You crazy?

I'm ain't gonna get eaten by some shark.
Ain't nobody got time for that.

The chances of you being bit
by a shark are, like, .0001%.

Not if you're black.

Sharks are racist as hell.

That's why they call them
"great whites."

Marc, the surfer, and I
really hit it off,

and he is so cute, like a young Matthew
McConaughey, but with real hair.

So nothing like
Matthew McConaughey.

I hope he texts me.
I love surfing.

I never go in the water, 'cause I know if
I start drowning, I'm not gonna fight it.

When I used to summer in St. Barths,
there'd be these sexy Italian surfers,

and they'd invite us
to sunbathe on their boards.

I mean, they robbed us,
but it was amazing.

Caroline, if you're looking
for that kind of guy,

I have a cousin
who loves the water.

It's the only place
he can move his legs.

- Oh, sweet. No thanks.
- Well, think about it.

You'll be at the front row
of every concert,

and he doesn't move around a lot
when he sleeps.

Here, give old Ironside
my number.

What? I love music,
and if he bugs me,

the city has one of those
free vans that'll take him home.

[Phone chimes]

[Gasps] It's the surfer
asking me out to dinner!

And he thinks he can get us into the hot,
new spot, Harlow and Daughters.

Oh, that's that trendy
restaurant that replaced

a perfectly good
hot dog on a stick.

Good night,
broke-ass divas.

Good night,
Brokeback waiter.

I'm gonna go
get a massage,

and then, who knows?
Maybe give one.

Oh, who am I kidding?
I'm coming back here pregnant.

- Luis, can you work for me tomorrow?
- Absolutely not, no.

Oleg's working, and I'll ask him
to wear his fishnet tank top.

Then yes.

Dinner with a cute guy who has
connections to the "A"-list place?

I'm living my old life.

Hey, everybody.

Did your old life
have one of these?

Caroline, what is
my number-one diner rule?

Don't tell anyone
the meat isn't real?

Shh. Come on.
If you can see it, it's real.

Don't tell anyone you buy the shrimp
out of your friend's trunk?

He lays down a blanket!
No.

No phones.

[Phone chimes]

Max, he got us
the reservation!

I'm going to dinner
at the new "it" place.

Ooh, the "it" place!

"Let's have dinner
at the 'it' place."

How come this isn't
the "it" place?

This isn't an "it" place.
It's more of an "it" hole.

Okay, so how do we
become an "it" place?

First, burn the place down,
start fresh.

Then you create hype by making it
impossible to get a reservation.

You basically refuse
to let anyone in.

Can I be the first?

Okay, I've put my date purse
together.

I've got my gum, my gloss, and a $20
bill to make it seem like I have money,

which I will return to the register
at the diner tomorrow.

Well, you're welcome
to use my date purse.

It's a Ziploc with a cigar
and a change of boxers.

And my phone
is fully charged,

so I can call an uber car
to take me home.

An uber car?

You can't afford
a fancy town car.

Yesterday, you used
an English muffin to exfoliate.

Yeah, and then I ate it.

Plus, it's on our
joint credit card,

which means every time
you make a dumb purchase,

you owe me a joint.

I don't want to have him take me
home and give him the wrong idea.

Oh, please do give him
the wrong idea.

Stay out all night
with the surfer.

Ride his half-pipe.

That's not surfboard,
that's snowboard.

Perfect, 'cause I'm snow-bored
with this conversation.

What do you think?
These things on full display?

I hate to be that roommate, but I didn't
say you could borrow my breasts.

What? It's just a push-up bra, chicken
cutlets, a little tissue, and some tape.

You know, natural.

Just go on your date
already!

Nancy and I have been really
looking forward to you leaving

so we can walk around naked
and do some lines of cat nip.

[Knocking at the door]

Ooh, that must be him.
Don't worry, he's not coming inside.

He better not,
cause we can't afford a baby.

- Oh, it's just Sophie.
- "Just Sophie"?

That was the name
of my talk show in Poland.

Oh, how I wish I could have been
a guest on that show.

No, there were no guests.
It was just Sophie!

Oh, you getting ready
for your big date, Caroline?

How did you
hear about my date?

Oh, well,
your voice travels.

Yeah, I hear everything
that does and doesn't happen

down here
and down there, so...

So let's just say I'm very glad
that you're going on a date.

Oh, and I got you
a little present.

Cinnamon mints,
for your first kiss.

Oh, that's so sweet, Sophie.

Yeah, and I got you
a big grab bag of condoms.

I got all sizes.

I got magnums,
I got super magnums,

I got regular, and...

"He's got
a great personality."

Here you go.

Usually, a "great personality" is
the only birth control I need.

Thank you,
but I am a lady,

and I won't be needing these
until our third date.

Well, you better hurry up
and get dressed.

Sophie,
I'm already dressed.

You are?

And I like
what I'm wearing.

You do?

Well, just put on
a little makeup.

I'm fully made up.

You are?

Oh, well, you know,
maybe when you do your hair.

Okay, I'm a little behind
on my hair.

My boobs were a bigger project
than I thought.

And I like what I'm wearing,
and I don't have time to change

'cause he's already
20 minutes late.

20 minutes late?

Wahh-wahh.

That's a no-show.

You've just got stood up.
You got stood up somethin' awful.

I did not get stood up.
I've never been stood up.

In fact, I wouldn't even know
if I was being stood up,

because that's how little
I know about being stood up.

Am I being stood up?

No, you are not.
Guys are always late.

I once waited
three days for a guy.

But he showed up
with the ransom money,

and you don't see me
living in a fridge anymore.

Okay, fine.

Nobody got stood up.

So I'll just sit here
and text while we wait...

You know, forever.

And then, finally,
when it dawns on you,

we can call our friend Oleg,
and he can go put a hit on him.

You know what, maybe he thought
we were meeting there.

I'm calling the restaurant
to see...

Yes, hi, has a Marc Faison
checked in yet?

He has not.

What about now?

It's just that he
was supposed...

Well, I'm busy too.

Don't be so snooty, you used
to be a hot dog on a stick.

Just a heads up, if he doesn't show,
I'm still getting naked.

[Phone chimes]
Ooh, there he is!

No, it's from Amazon.

Someone's sending me a copy
of He's Just Not That Into You.

Yeah,
I'm here for you, girl.

Well, I got stood up.

Remember where you are, Max.

This was the day
Caroline Channing got stood up.

Well, screw him
for standing you up.

And from now on, never trust a guy
who surfs anything besides porn.

Oh, look,
Harlow and Daughters

has a real old-timey,
general store kind of vibe.

I guess they take "Throwback Thursday"
really seriously here.

I mean, it's 1840.

Yeah, I wanted to take you back
to a time before you were stood up.

Thank you for making me
take the reservation, Max.

I mean, otherwise, I was just gonna
get in bed and be depressed.

You were in bed
and you were depressed.

Don't rewrite history
just 'cause these folks have.

I mean, we are
smack in the belly

of Williamsburg ironic chic,
and I want to smack it.

Look, they even have a country
clothesline hung with baby clothes.

We should get this for Han.

I mean, that is the most
pretentious thing I've ever seen.

Hi, welcome to Harlow and Daughters.
I'm the host, Brian-Brian.

No, that is.

Yes, hi, um, Brian-Brian.

We have a reservation.
Faison, party of two.

Is your whole party here?

Well, I don't know how whole I could
ever hope to be, as I'm illegitimate.

Yes, we're both here.
Thank you.

So both you and Mr. Faison
are here?

Yes, I'm transitioning.
Ask around.

You can have a drink, and I'll call you
when your table is ready.

Thank you, thank you,
Brian-Brian.

I'll be right over.

Go use your new boobs
to get us a seat at the bar.

Hi, I know what
"wait by the bar" means.

I've been working in restaurants
since your clothes were in style.

- It means I'll seat you when your...
- Brian-Brian, Bri-Bri, B.B., come on.

You and I both know
there's no guy coming.

My friend got stood up, so
please don't make things worse.

Just take out your cool, little
hunting knife and cut us some slack.

This is where I'd tip you
with cash or offer you sex,

but I'm kinda broke and you're
kinda gay, so just be nice.

We don't really need to bring
my sexuality into it.

I understand, it's hard
to be out 100 years ago.

Oh, funny.

Right this way,
Mr. Faison.

Wow, that was quick.
They're so nice here.

Yep, just regular folks, sitting
around designer pickle barrels.

All right, here's your table.
Have a seat.

Sure, where? On these Amish birthing
stools we're all calling chairs?

Stick to the gay jokes.

Our Wi-Fi password
is on the ox hide.

Your waitress will be
right over.

Max, a waitress will be right over,
and it won't be us.

Look,
dirty sawdust floors.

If we got a bag of wood chips, our
apartment could be the new "it" place.

Hello, my name is York.

Hard to believe, but a man named
Brian-Brian has been dethroned.

York? That's fun.
"York" as in "New"?

York as in York.
Just York.

So what's this bit?

Okay. Well, um, York, we'd like
to start with some drinks.

Having a girls' night out.
All the single ladies put ya hands up!

Yeah, you can't force it.

Our special libation this evening
is "The Small Pox."

It's absinthe, cloves,
orange bitters

hand-muddled
in a mason jar.

Was that drink
directed by Wes Anderson?

Can we just get two of your "ye olde"
cheapest beers as soon as possible?

Because Dr. Quinn,
I need some medicine, woman.

York, does the special soup
have any garlic?

- Oh, my God, no way!
- What? Is someone making soap?

No.
No garlic?

You still think
the surfer's coming.

Well, he might.

See, I was supposed to have
a date with this guy...

You don't care.
So, the soup?

Actually, I'm just
taking drink orders right now.

Wow, who loved you?

Eh, I'm guessing
she never went

to a father/daughter dance
with her mom's weed dealer.

You don't know, Max.
Maybe he lost his phone

and he didn't have my number,
so he's on his way running here.

You think he's just
gonna rush in soaking wet

and be like, "Oh, I'm so sorry.
The traffic was terrible.

The waves were
bumper-to-bumper."

This is not
a Katherine Heigl movie.

Sorry, "movie."

Fine, he's not coming.

And I'm not getting into
the Katie Heigl thing.

Not here, not now.
Let's just enjoy our acorns.

[Phone ringing]

Ooh, "blocked number."
Maybe it's him. Hello?

Hang up.
He's not coming.

Our drinks are right there.

I can see them over yonder,
on ye olde bar.

It's been an hour, where is
our waitress, Lizzie Borden?

Probably in the back deciding
which words to pronounce weirdly.

I'm starving.
Bust out those chicken cutlets.

No wonder they don't have
any bad yelp reviews.

No one's ever
tasted their food.

Hi.
Um, our drinks?

And did you ask the chef
about the soup?

You know,
I haven't had a minute.

She hasn't had a minute?

What's she been doing,
dancing with wolves?

I mean, have you ever?

I know, can you even?
[Scoffs]

Byron and I have been here
forever,

and have yet to see our
dandelion chickpea foie-gras.

He's hypoglycemic
and I'm Lila.

And I'm pissed.
I'm getting our drinks.

- Would you get us some wine?
- Oh, sure, what kind?

A chardonnay for me, and Byron
will have a sauvignon blanc.

- Max, no, they'll kick us out and...
- And what? What, Caroline?

You won't be here
when "he arrives?"

Dear Lord,
the man is not coming!

I know that, Max, and he's
not coming because he died.

He died, that's the only reason
I can accept.

What's up?
How we all doin' tonight?

Not so good. My girlfriend
just broke up with me.

Oh, yeah?
You like blondes?

'Cause I got one
who's ready to pop.

No, man,
I'm into Asian chicks.

Yeah, who isn't?
Except for Asian guys.

Hey, do me a favor,
just wait a minute,

and then come over to my table
and flirt with my friend.

Why would I do that?

On the house.

Is that the "dandelion chickpea
and other things

that don't belong
in a dish together" thing?

All right,
your dandelion chickpea,

a chardonnay,
and a sauvignon blanc. Enjoy.

What do you think
you're doing?

Waiting on tables.
Look into it.

York, York, don't be mad.
Byron was starving and we're thirsty.

Don't kick us out, we're
too weak to go anywhere else.

The soup has garlic.

Oh, then no.
The salmon, please.

Bring her the damn soup, she
ain't kissing nobody tonight.

And I'll have the free-range chicken
that thought it had a chance.

For your help.
Byron wants you to have it.

Well, Byron is the only real
old-fashioned thing in here.

I hope you both
survive the winter.

Hey, can I join you?

Ooh, I think that
"can I join you?" Was to you.

Oh, sure, have a seat.

You're pretty.
You have a good body.

Wow, thank you.

That's actually
kind of nice to hear,

because this
is hard to believe,

but I got stood up tonight,

and it kind of
makes me feel good

when you say I'm pretty
and I have a good body.

[Phone chimes]
What are you doing?

Oh, I'm on tinder.
It's the straight grindr.

I just got a hit.
Well, I'm out.

Thanks for the drink.

You paid a guy
to say I'm pretty?

And then he blew me off?

Oh, my God. I just realized
something upsetting.

What, that we could be enjoying
delicious hot dogs on sticks right now?

- No, I'm a "B."
- No, you're an "A."

That bra just makes
you look like a "B."

No, I mean me, as a woman.
I'm a "B."

You know, all this time,
I kinda thought I was an "A,"

but maybe I'm just a "B."

That's why he walked away
and why the surfer stood me up.

Caroline, I really want
to be here for you right now,

but I gotta get a gin fizz
to the prospector in the corner.

Max, am I a "B"?
Why didn't he come?

All I know about that surfer
is that he is a "D"

followed by three
other letters.

I'd spell it out for you, but I'm
literally afraid I'd get it wrong.

Interesting that you
didn't say I wasn't a "B."

Look, I don't give myself
letters in life.

To me, it is clearly
a pass/fail situation.

And you're sitting up,

not drooling on yourself,
so pass.

Well, well, well, where have
you ladies been all night?

I don't know, I'd say somewhere
between 1846 and 1860.

And it is so great
to be back in 1974.

Well, Han, you did a good job
of making this place exclusive.

There is literally
nobody here.

It wasn't my doing, there was
a possum in the men's room.

Correction, there is
a possum in the men's room.

Oh, the ingredients
are escaping the kitchen again?

Well, I gotta go to the men's room
and pull out the possum.

Oh, is that what you do
when we're not here?

All right,
let's sit down

in that authentically run-down
old booth and eat something.

Yeah, see, those stains
aren't fake, that's real blood.

I was right here
when that guy got stabbed.

Like I said at the time, "call me 'honey'
one more time, and I will stab you."

You know what I just
realized?

Even if I am a "B,"
at least I'm an authentic "B."

I don't pretend
to be something I'm not.

You do kind of pretend
to be something you're not.

A "B."

Finally,
I have some customers.

You know, I've been sitting in the back
watching Oleg shuck his corn all night?

Thank you.

Now, Luis knows
how to give service.

Come on, chica, don't set me up
like that, it's too easy.

Max, I think I'm gonna
let go of letter-grading myself

and adopt
your pass/fail system.

And sitting with you right here
is so not a fail.

Oh, it's just
Oleg and Sophie.

Oh, my God!
You looked 'cause you thought

it was gonna be the surfer!
Epic fail!

Hey, what are you two
doing together?

Oh, Sophie and I had
some business to take care of.

Right, Sophie?

Oh, yeah.
Caroline, we got your back.

That Mike won't be out there
surfing again for quite a while.

The surfer's name isn't Mike.
It's Marc.

Oh...

No wonder he kept screaming,
"My name is not Marc!"

Well, I'll tell you
one thing,

we may have seen
a lot of fake things tonight,

but that's a
for-real possum.

Wow, Han's possum is bigger
than I thought it would be.

Okay, Max, I figured out
our new schedule.

And I figured out the cheap toothpaste
we've been using is really diaper cream.

On the plus side,
that rash cleared up on my gums.

We'll do our diner shift
from 6:00 till 2:00,

then sell cupcakes here
from 2:00 to 4:00,

make the cupcakes in the morning
from 7:00 to 11:00,

and then pastry school
from 12:00 to 4:00.

- Forget anything?
- Just poopin' and sleepin'.

Now, I have to go
rewrite the schedule.

Let's go, Max, you have a huge,
huge day tomorrow.

- First day of pastry school.
- Stop saying it's huge.

Whenever I think something's gonna be
huge, it just turns out to be all balls.

Season 3, Episode 10
"And the First Day of School"

Synced by Reef


I splurged
and had my blouse cleaned.

Dry cleaning bags remind me
of when I had money.

Really? They remind me of when
my mother tried to suffocate me.

Allegedly.
Let's go.

Wait, wait.
Max, you can't go yet.

I need you to stay
and help with something.

Han, I told you... it's bend and wipe,
then up come your big boy pants.

Yeah, Han’s right. You can't go.
Stay here a few more minutes.

Why? Oh. Are we having
an intervention for Max?

Hey, everybody.

Oh, I hope I'm not late for Max's
first day of school surprise party.

Sophie, we hadn't
surprised her yet.

Oh, but she's right there.
You just blew it, Han.

Aw, a surprise party.

- Isn't this sweet, Max?
- I don't trust it.

Last time Oleg yelled "surprise" at me,
his penis was on a hot dog bun.

One meat lover's pizza.

And one meat lover.

Max, come on.
Get it while it's hot.

You're opening that box.

Hm, who's got a ten to tip
the cute pizza delivery guy?

Sophie, this is Luis,
the day waiter.

Oh, you're Sophie,
Oleg’s ex.

Sister, I know
all about you.

Oh, do you?
Do you know all about me?

I'm his good friend.

You know, I'm having trouble
hearing your accent.

Did you say "good friend"
or "girlfriend?"

Please, mami.
I wish.

I like the entertainment.

It's better than the magician at my
friend Stephanie's 16th birthday

that made
her virginity disappear.

Max, we're all so proud
of you.

Tomorrow is the first day
of the rest of your life.

Aw, crap.
I gotta do this again?

All right, but this time, I'm not
seeing Trouble with the Curve.

- You are about to do something very big.
- Yes, she is. Such a big step.

Big step
for both of us,

'cause I'll be using
my business acumen

working in the office
to help pay the tuition.

Shh.
I'm talking about Max.

So we all chipped in to get you
something for your first day of school.

It's my first day too.

Caroline, please, I can't hear Han
talking about Max, okay?

Here you go, darling,
a book bag for school.

So what, then? Is my surprise
party after this one?

What is happening?

People doing nice things
for me and smiling?

Am I transferring
foster homes again?

And there's
more stuff inside.

That was supposed to be
a surprise too.

Oh.
Surprise!

Max, open it.
Look inside.

Yeah, Max, see what's inside
for your big day.

Big day for Max.
Big day for me as well.

- A metrocard? No way.
- From me. Unlimited rides.

Oh. Unlimited rides? Is that
what your tramp stamp says?

I was gonna get mad,
but that was a damn good one.

What's this?
Han's house?

A simple "thank you"
would suffice.

Thank you for
your house, Han.

It's a pencil case,
and I love it.

And I was sitting here, thinking how you
were all ignoring my part of the big day.

And then, you give me this pencil case
to use in the office and prove me wrong.

That's for Max.

What the hell
is wrong with you people?

Max doesn't even need pencils.
She'll be baking.

(Earl) Well, she'll be baked.
Take a look.

(Max) [Gasps] Joints.

Earl, that's so sweet.
These should last me till recess.

Wait, where's the chef's coat
Sophie had monogrammed?

Han, that was supposed to be
a surprise.

Oh, I know.
Karma's a bitch.

Oh, well.

Look.

(Max) [Gasps] My name's on this.

[Laughs] The only thing my name's ever
been on before is a urine sample.

Thank you, everyone.

So there is nothing
in that bag for me?

Nothing? Wow. I'd even take Oleg’s
penis in a hot dog bun right now.

I'll be right back.

- Getting on.
- Please move.

- On!
- Move!

- On! On!
- Move! Move!

I love the subway. It's the perfect
place to get out aggression.

I just punched someone
in the kidney.

- It was me.
- I know.

Oh, oh, bad smell, like someone
hooked up with a falafel.

- It was me.
- I know.

- Max.
- Sorry.

Subways, planes, and mosh pits,
I let it ride.

[Sighs] I love the smell
of this fresh, dry-cleaned blouse.

[Sighs] I am so excited to be
out of that waitress uniform,

and back in my chic
business clothes,

and, you know,
going to my office,

where I'll probably save the day
using some of my Wharton magic.

You know, I think I like
you better without hope.

Max, you know this school
is expensive, right?

You're going in
with a good attitude, right?

No, that's what Earl's pencils
are for.

Don't worry, I'll do my best. I
mean, look, I have a book bag.

The only thing my mother
ever sent me to school with

was a note that said
"Check me for lice."

It was so sweet of everyone
to give you that,

even though I didn't sleep
all night about it.

And it looks kind of expensive.
Check for a designer label.

- Why? It's the thought that counts.
- Since when?

Let me see it.

Second Avenue station.
This is second Avenue.

(Caroline) [Gasps] No, no, no, Max!
No, he got the book bag. Good, Max, good.

Don't let go. [Sigh s ]

What if the train
starts to leave

and my arms pop off?

How will I go
to pastry school?

I'll be one of those people decorating
cookies with a bag in their mouth.

You are the devil.
The devil.

You have nothing.

Pull, Max, pull!
Pull it from the devil!

Can't.
The devil works out.

(Caroline) Ooh!

[Both gasp]

My bag.

My blouse.

My weed.

Oh, great, look. Class has started.
My new life already blows.

Oh, look. There's chef Gorgeous.
I don't want him to see me like this.

I'm gonna go to the restroom and see if
cold water can get out any of the stain.

Go, Max.

But I don't have my
chef coat or book bag.

I know I only had them for a couple of
hours, but it was the best part of me.

You'll do great.

First, do me a favor.
Check me for lice.

This course is designed
to introduce you

to the skills and techniques required
in the production of yeast bread,

short pastry doughs, custards,
pate a choux, and cake batters.

Chef Max, you are late.

Wait, are sure class
doesn't start at 10:17?

Sorry, I got robbed
on the subway by some jerk.

Hey, hey, hey,
I'm right here.

I ran out of options, and I didn't wanna
strip my way through pastry school.

That's an option?

All right, chefs.
Let's focus.

Did he say he wants
to "foke us"?

___

Morning, Bebe.

Hi. Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

And I should tell you
my doctor says

I'm not allowed to hear bad news
for another month.

I apologize
for my appearance.

We got robbed on the subway, and
then someone hit me with hot coffee.

Then, I went to wash cold water
on the stain

and somehow wound up entering
myself in a wet T-shirt contest.

Um, that's a lot of energy
for me,

so I'm just gonna need to sit
here for a second and be quiet.

I know we're being quiet, which
I'm all about, but cute dogs.

Oh, thanks. They're cocker spaniels.
I rescue them.

You know, people rescue
greyhounds and pit bulls,

but everyone ignores
the cocker spaniel.

They're like, "Ew, eye goo.
Shoot it."

I have three cockers.

Do you have any pets?

I have a horse, Chestnut.
He's a thoroughbred.

[Sighs]
Well, what can I do first?

[Gasps] What's this?
Why am I holding a juice menu?

Every day, we get fresh-pressed juice
for the students and the staff.

What a treat. Fresh juice is such a scam
unless someone else is payin'.

[Laughs] I'll take
the Greens number three.

Uh-huh, well, put it on the list
when you get the other ones.

Wait, I'm supposed
to get the juice?

Oh, boy, it's like
I'm a bad news machine.

Oh. Okay.

Happy to do it.
Surprised, but happy.

Uh, maybe I could change into
one of those cute chef jackets.

Oh, chef Nicholas only permits
pastry chefs to wear these.

But I can't meet everyone
on my first day looking like this.

I mean, it's already bad enough
I'm the juice girl.

I have some workout clothes
you can wear.

Don't worry.
I haven't worn them yet.

But I will someday.

Hi.
Hi, everyone.

I'm here to take
the fresh juice orders

and also to say this is not
what I came to work in.

[Laughs]

What I came to work in
had less eyes.

Caroline, welcome.

How is it going
in the office so far?

So great, and so not what
I came to work in.

I'm usually wearing Chanel,
not le chien.

That's "dog" in French.

Oh, 'cause it's "dork"
in English.

Well, it is lovely to see
both of your faces.

Class, we start
with the basics.

No, no, no,
you in the back...

Juice, miss? Care for a juice from
someone who scored 1560 on her SATs?

You can score more
than 500?

Why the hell
are you wearing that?

I didn't think your chest
could get any sadder.

It's Bebe's.

Max, taking juice orders is
not what I came here to do.

I hear you.
I'll have the Ruby red.

I always keep the edge clean,
so when I'm squeezing it,

it's not gonna have cream
popping all over the place.

Words to live by.
[Laughs]

I have
the opposite problem.

Yo, my cream's poppin'
right now.

What are you doing? You told me
you were gonna take school seriously.

It's not me. That guy's a bad influence.
Look at him.

He looks like someone who
sells drugs on Sesame Street.

You're gonna get
in trouble,

and I am not wearing a cocker spaniel
so you can get kicked out of class.

Right. I hear you.
Now, where's my juice?

(Deke) Hey, chef Max.
Check out my technique.

[Pastry bag farts]

Awesome gross sound bonus.

[Laughs]

Chef, if you find this
so funny,

why don't you take
a fiver?

Isn't this how
your saying goes?

I don't have a saying,

but if I did,
it'd be more like

"Eatin' ain't cheatin'."

Anyone else
who finds something hilarious

can also go
into the hall.

- Chef Max?
- Nope, nothing 'ilarious. Teach on.

Enough with
the dirty jokes.

We are all here
to become master bakers.

Master-baking is something
I work really hard at it.

- To be a master baker...
- I'll be in the hall.

- Hi, I'm Deke.
- Did you say "freak?"

- Deke.
- Did you say "geek?"

Deke, as in
"Big Deke."

Mine's bigger.
[Laughs]

We should be lab partners.
Come on. It'll be bitchin'.

Max and Deke,
making cakes.

Sunday, Sunday, Sunday,
with a special performance by Creed.

[Mimics electric guitar]

Okay, now stop,
stop, stop.

I am trying to be a good student,
so you just stay away from me.

You are
a bad influence.

And I know I nailed that speech
'cause kids at school

used to say it to me
all the time.

[Watch beeps]

- Time to change your tampon?
- Yep.

Day two.
Serious flow.

Killer Fanny pack.
Where's your tribal poncho?

Ah, keep my needles
in this.

[Gasps] You're a drug addict too?
God. You are irresistible.

[Laughs]

It's... it's insulin.
I'm a diabetic.

A diabetic pastry chef.

Wow, you're even more
self-destructive than me.

So diabetes,
how is that?

Disappointing.
I put in for syphilis.

Stop laughing. I have to carry
27 juices 2 blocks wearing this.

Why'd you let the dog lady
talk to you like that?

She's my friend,
even in that shirt.

Well, there goes
another $12.

I have spent more money dry cleaning
this blouse than I have on health care.

Health care? You mean that box of
band-aids we got at the 99 cent store?

I just have to look good tomorrow.
Today was mortifying.

They called me "Sad dog"
at the juice place.

"Sad dog,
your juices are ready."

Sad dog, pick up.

Can you take these to table ten?
I'm backed up on the booths.

Can you? I'm kind of just
sitting here a minute,

enjoying not being told
what to do.

I get enough of it
at that school.

Look.

If you're gonna do the martyr
thing, do it right.

Stick your hand
in boiling oil

or even more painful, binge-watch
Shahs of Sunset on Bravo.

I need to talk to you
in the kitchen now.

Leave, someone's about to get
schooled about school.

This looks like it's going
to get dirty and ugly.

May I film it?

And if so, may I then
sell it on the Internet?

- Look. You can't just do this for me.
- You're right. So we're out?

No, we're not out, you said
you were gonna do this for me.

I know, but you just said I can't
just do it for you, and I agree.

- I mean, who was I kidding?
- Me. You were kidding me.

I went in there thinking
I was gonna use

my business skills,
and whatever hope

I had of a flirtation
with Frenchie McFrench

went out the window when he saw me
wearing that t-shirt that said,

"Don't forget
to spay and neuter me."

Fine, I can quit.
It's fine.

- It is? Really?
- No, it's not fine.

- Who am I kidding?
- Me. You were kidding me.

Well, you've gotta figure out
something there to keep you interested,

because you can't go to
pastry school just for me,

and I'm not gonna not go
to pastry school for you.

Okay. You're right, Max.
Of course I'll do it for you.

I just had a bad day.
I mean, we both did.

You lost your man's briefcase
and your drugs,

and I lost my dignity
and a possible love interest.

(All) Surprise!

See, that's how
it's supposed to go.

- We got you a new book bag.
- Yeah, and a new chef's jacket.

And a switchblade.

Yeah, 'cause we're not buyin'
another chef's jacket.

Max, you know
what this means?

That I got two surprises,
and you got nothing?

No, that everything's gonna
work out at that school.

I mean, in the blink
of an eye,

just like this, things can change
from bad to good.

Well, not totally good. They still
haven't gotten me anything.

Caroline, you didn't
not get anything.

Here, your very own
pencil case.

But no pencils.
My pencil dealer got busted.

Aw.
Thank you, guys.

I'm touched.
I was not expecting it.

Really? 'Cause you kinda
bullied us all into it.

So that's a 780 on verbal,
and a 780 on math.

And with my degree
in finance,

jackass-ing around the city getting juice
could be seen as a waste of my talents.

And as the valedictorian
at my graduation said...

and I'm stealin'
from myself here,

"I've seen the future of finance,
and it's us."

- So you want me to get the juices?
- Just for today. Please?

Meringue cookies are a simple way
to practice our pastry bag technique.

Hm, interesting technique
you got going there, chef.

Dude, we gotta ditch
these deadbeat partners.

I'm stuck over there
with grandma.

No, I'm staying
with the big guy next to me.

He's not gonna get me in trouble.
He never talks. Get outta here.

- Go back to your own table, Fat Albert.
- Okay. I'm going back.

And the Fat Albert thing was
'cause I'm black, not fat, right?

'Cause I go to the gym
two, three times a year.

I hear talking,
but no baking up front.

No, no, no, you only hear baking.
Just furiously master-baking up here.

The meringue needs
to have nice peaks.

You are looking to make
moist, pointy peaks.

I like to pinch them.

Chef, seriously, man-to-man,
we got a problem.

I don't think Max should be stuck
with that big guy. He's not cool.

I was just over there, and the only
pointy peaks he's interested in are hers.

Talkin' boobies here, chef.

Chef John, chef Deke here seems to think
you are sexually harassing Max.

Oh, please.

If I was harassing anyone,
it would be you, chef.

I mean, come on.

- Be right back, Big Mary.
- You know it.

- Where's my juice? It's been an hour.
- The mood swing elf's getting them.

Look, I'm coming in there to flirt
with chef Nicholas, and when I enter,

I need you to say,
"Caroline, you look amazing."

No.

I actually physically
can't say that.

I would rather walk in there
and yell,

"I have crabs,
and three of them just escaped."

Call 9-1-1.
Call 9-1-1.

Something's happened
to the adorable mixed-race one.

Deke?

He's diabetic.
He needs Insulin.

Has anyone here ever
administered a needle?

Uh, administer means the same
thing as "shove it in," right?

Good, good, good, Max.
Come, come, come.

Okay, uh, his syringes
are in his fanny pack.

I've actually never done this without
Iron Maiden playing in the background,

but I'll give it
a shot.

Just put it anywhere
in my hot bod.

God help us.

- Oh, I hate needles. I can't look.
- Oh.

Get it together, ladies.

This is why I'm not allowed
to hold babies.

Max, I think you and Deke should be
lab partners from now on,

in case something like this
happens again.

- Is that okay?
- I guess if I have to.

Max?

I guess if I have to.

Oh, mon Dieu!

What, did you not take
your Insulin on purpose?

I really wanted
to be your partner.

Bebe, I can't find a chef jacket
anywhere in here.

And I'm sorry, I know
I'm not supposed to wear one,

but I'm really cold, and I can't
walk around like this all day.

Maybe I can help.

You can't stand there
wet and cold.

Take my jacket.
Oh, no, no, no.

You don't have...
oh, that'll work.

I'm sorry about the no shirt under, but
I just get so hot when I'm teaching.

Yeah, hot.
So hot.

Oh mon Dieu.

I was just giving it
to Caroline.

I mean, she needs something to wear,
and... and now, she has it.

Chef, I will
see you later.

Caroline...

Max, I think I found something
to keep me interested.

This is weird.
So I'm the good student now?

And you're the one
sleeping with the teacher?

We're not sleeping together.
Why? Do you think he wants to?

I don't know, but you better hurry it up
before Big Mary gets him.

Probably something like
OCD pandas

or owls that say "whom."

Another one?
I miss the days

when you could just walk outside
and your biggest fear

was getting stabbed
in the neck.

Okay, no one panic.

Remember, they can't come inside
unless they're invited.

Oh, wait.
That's vampires and me.

I can't wait around, y'all.

I'm going on a bar crawl

he's all about punctuality.

Otherwise, hello?
It's me he'll be looking for.

-Excuse me, sir,

Rest in peace, Earl.

Taken seconds before his time.

Come on, let's go out

There's another one out back!

I threw a garbage can

but it only made her
more cheerful!

Earl, what happened out there?
Is she gone?

Don't worry.
Everything's okay.

Unless you are

Oh, no, they got to Earl!

Look here:

Ooh, gotta get that.

It's either Randy

or Han clicked "Find my iPad."

(laughs)
(tablet beeps)

Hey, Max.
Wanted to call you

before you opened
the dessert bar.

You know, while you're still
a little sober.

Hey, Randy! How was the gym?
It was back and bi's, right?

Well, you should know,
you set up my iCal.

Hey, Max, did you get
my text about tonight?

(gasps) No, we didn't get it,
did we?

Um, I think he just
sent it to my phone

since I'm the only one of us
dating him.

Let me look.

Abs, abs, pecs, penis--
oh, here it is.

Yeah, I'd be down for
a face-to-FaceTime movie night.

Ooh, anyone in the mood for
something Brendan Fraser-y?

Not even
Brendan Fraser's parents.

Well, I'm not watching anything
unless someone

gets kicked in the nuts
in the trailer.

It can be a woman, I'm open.

Well, I'm not.

You know what?

I have an idea.

How about I set you up
with someone?

I think I have
the perfect guy for you.

A gay guy who doesn't mind
loud chewing?

Um, I'm sorry my teeth
aren't as soft as yours.

Tyler's an
up-and-coming associate

at our New York office.

And I'm pretty sure
he's my Secret Santa.

Don't pity set me up.

I like to think
I'm above that.

But I'm not!
I'm in.

Hey, girls.

Raise your hand if
you're super depressed today.

Don't engage.

Just ignore him

like he ignores the word "no."

Did someone just say, "Yes"?

Randy, I have to
call you back.

There's a sexual predator
that needs my attention.

Hey, Oleg.

What's up, R-Dog?
Can I talk to you man-to-man

about a pretty serious--

Bye, guys!

(tablet beeps)

(sighs)

together: What?

Sophie wants me to get rid of

my beloved Toyota Yaris.

That car is a part of me.

It is the yin to my wang.

What if we just cement the door
to the diner closed?

Oleg, Han is looking
for you, man.

And he's really mad because...

well, that's when
I stopped listening.

Sorry, Earl, what'd you say?

I stopped listening
after you said "Han."

We would need
a very strong cement.

Like, brick with
cement over it.

Oleg, did you really think
you could pass this off as you?

You don't wear glasses.

I thought there was something
different about you.

I've never seen people
work so hard at not working.

(car horn honks)

Hey, everybody!

Take a look at my sweet ride.

It's a minivan.

I've been test driving
this bad boy

with this other bad boy
all day.

For six hours.
We went through

every Wendy's drive-thru
in Queens.

I wrote "Help me" on a napkin.

But nobody did.

I wanted to see if all seven
of the cup holders worked.

And now we can
drink Diet Coke as a family.

You want me to give up
my sexy Yaris for a minivan?

Why don't I just drive around
in a uterus with wheels?

I'm not asking you
to buy a Prius.

Oleg, all we have to do now
is sell the Yaris.

Are you allowed
to sell evidence?

Okay, Jose, you can show me
how it corners

on the way back to Coney Island.

Then can I please go home?

(laughs)
This guy's hilarious.

He's been saying that all day.

Tyler, hi.
I'm so sorry we're late.

Someone jumped
in front of our subway car.

I keep telling you
to stop doing that.

There was a coupon
for a free falafel on the track.

You must be Max.

Guilty as charged.

But never convicted.

And you must be Caroline.

Wow, you are even prettier

than your Facebook pictures
I definitely wasn't

trolling through.

I do what I can
with a shadeless lamp

and an iPhone 2.

(laughs)

You're waiting for one more?

Uh, nope.
My boyfriend's in my purse.

Well, my boyfriend's
a poster of Tom Hardy,

but this is sadder.

Hey, Randy.

You look nice tonight.

It's the "hefe" filter.

Are these prices?
'Cause they're all two numbers.

Don't worry, it's on me.

Can we have a kids menu?

My girl may want
noodles and butter.

Oh, does this guy
know me or what?

I think you'll really enjoy
the lobster quesadilla.

Oh, I love tapas.

Well, have you ever been
to Barcelona?

On the way to Ibiza!

(both laugh)

Yeesh.

Remind me to never
go to France.

Hey, you mind if I put
a puppy face on you

while we do this?

You haven't yet?
I assumed I had a snout.

All right, let me see
what I'm gonna have for dinner.

Either Cookie Crisp
or Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

You have both?
I love dating a rich guy.

Hey, Caroline.
You know Tyler spends

his weekends
at the soup kitchen?

That is so sweet.

So do we.

Best hot dog beans
in the city.

We're holding hands.

Ooh.

(Caroline chuckles)

Yeah, I'll just have
a roll instead.

(tablet beeps)

Uh-oh.
My boyfriend is dying!

Hi, um, he's at 3%.

Can I, uh,
plug my date in anywhere?

There's an outlet
on the wall right there.

Huh.
Heck yeah.

Scusi.

Ehh.

Hello.

Mind if I put my wine here
while I charge my man?

You guys are so much cooler
than the last couple

we were on a double date with.

Speaking of which,
looks like our third wheel

found a guy to make out with.

Wow, people can be
so inappropriate.

(spits)
Ugh!

You guys didn't tell me
there was fennel in these!

I say we just call it a night.

Yeah. Ugh.
This was a swing and a miss.

Um, you know you're smiling.

This is about the time of day
you start weeping

and saying "Why me?"
at the ceiling.

I am smiling, Max.

Kissing Tyler last night
awoke something in my loins.

Loins?
That was out of loin.

And now I need to be aloin.

So do I.
Tonight, I'm making Tyler

a romantic dinner
in our apartment.

Also, do we have
a second plate?

Yes, I keep it in our limousine,
Your Majesty.

And I'll tell you what I tell
you any time

a guy smiles at you and you
start planning your wedding.

I'll have the chicken
and the fish.

You've made your order clear.

But this isn't about that.
This is about Stella

getting her groove back.

Maybe it should be about
updating your references.

Stella's 90 now.

All she wants back
is her mobility.

Max, I haven't had sex in...

You don't have to
whisper, girl.

We all know
it's coming up on two years.

That you hear?

I yelled "Help"
into your face

for an hour yesterday.

Say what?

Max, I don't want
a relationship.

I just wanna break me off
a piece of that Kit Kat bar.

You know, sexually.

Don't drag Kit Kats into this.

Who got Kit Kat?

I hope Tyler knows
"I'm making you dinner"

is code for "I'm DTML."

Down to make love.

And I'm down to
my last conversation with you

for saying "making love."

But I'm happy for you, girl.

I'm also happy for Earl,
'cause he had two years

in the "Will Caroline Ever
Have Sex Again?" pool.

-What did you have?
-I wasn't in the pool.

-Aw, thank you.
-I just ran it.

And I will say,
seeing you and Tyler

make out in a public place
was kind of a--

-Turn on?
-No.

-Erotic awakening?
-No, it had nothing

to do with you.

It made me realize I haven't
actually laid lips on Randy

since we decided to be
in a relationship again.

So tell him to fly here.

Maybe you can stay at a hotel.

'Cause I may need your bed.

If I put too much
pressure on mine,

it flips back into the wall.

Yeah.
I do miss him.

And I'm kind of sick
of licking my iPad.

Know what I mean?

No.
That's how long it's been.

Hey, everybody!

Ah.
Baby Barbara loves that.

(giggling)

Oh, we got good news.

And it's not just 'cause the guy
selling the VHS pornos outside

asked if we were sisters.

I have some good news, too.

I'm gonna have sex tonight.

If you know what I mean.

Oh, no.

I lost the pool.

Yeah, I said ten years.

And that's only 'cause "never"
was already taken.

Sophie, I haven't been able
to sell the Yaris.

Looks like we're gonna have to
keep it forever.

I tried, for only, like an hour.

But I tried.

Oh, Oleg.
Yeah, well, the good news is,

you don't have to worry
about selling it.

Good, I didn't try.

Ah, 'cause I already sold it!

What?

Oh, no.
It's like you've just

taken my manhood from me.

Okay, I can't hold this in
any longer.

Who had "never"?

I did.

Hey, Sophie,
at least tell me

you sold it to a stud who will
carry on my sexual legacy.

Guess who's the owner
of a 2008 Yaris?

Oh, this is tougher to take than
the success of a close friend.

Luckily we have my sexcapades
to lift everyone's spirits.

I'm gonna go stick my Garfield
to the back window.

Oh, that car was magic.

And now, the only tail
my Yaris will ever see again

belongs to a lasagna-eating cat!

What did Randy say?
Did you tell him

I'm gonna have
a horizontal hoedown?

He was on your email blast.

He's coming tomorrow night.

But don't worry, I'll get out of
the apartment tonight.

I'll find a pick-up
stick ball game or something.

Okay, now who do I give my $5 to
for the pool?

You know what?
I think I'm gonna hold onto it

till it actually happens.

Ooh, fancy.

You got all the kinds
of cheeses.

White, yellow, orange.

Uh-buh-buh!
Whatever he doesn't eat

is our lunch for the week.

Well, I'll be back
in a few hours.

I'd say break a leg,
but you're so out of practice,

you just might.

Thanks, Max.
I really need this.

I'll try to text you
when it's over.

I'll know when it's over,
right?

Yeah, he'll leave immediately.

(knocking at door)

I believe that's
my FedSex delivery.

Godspeed.

And thank you
for your service.

Hey.

Hey.

-Hey.
-Hey.

That's enough small talk.

Unbelievable!

Randy just canceled!

He can't leave L.A.
'cause of "work stuff."

And now my phone died, so I
can't Google ways to kill him.

I'll have to do it
from memory.

Ugh, I need to charge this.

Oh, that is so rude of me.

Do you guys need this outlet?

-Olive?
-I'm allergic.

It's gone.

So, what's the main course?

(giggles)
Me: the other white meat.

That sounds great,
but maybe some crackers first.

Your text did say,
"Come hungry."

And thirsty!

Well, I'm always thirsty,
'cause I'm an alcoholic.

(laughs)
That's so funny.

I don't even care
if you're not kidding.

MAX: I'm just mad
you're not coming.

I'm not yelling!

I am angrily whispering
because my phone

still isn't charged, and
Caroline's in the other room

trying to remember
how to have sex.

She's kidding.

Nothing's changed, right?

I think there's more choking
now, but it's not my thing.

All right,
my phone's at 23%.

I'm gonna go steal a car
and finish charging it.

Okay, see you in the morning,
not before, bye.

(cell phone rings)

It's Randy.
I'm not getting it.

Hm, you and me both, sister.

Okay, that should do it.

Good-bye, Randy.

(cell phone rings)

It's Randy.

Don't you dare get it.

Max, please don't
threaten my date.

He's not a kid
with a McFlurry.

I kinda have to get this.
He's sort of my boss.

And he doesn't know it yet,
but he's my Secret Santa.

I'm warning you,
she's not having sex with you

if you answer that.

Uh, hello!

Who are you trying
to punish here?

All right.
The phone stopped ringing.

Everybody calm down.

You did not vacuum your bed
for nothing.

I mean, you can't be
too mad at Randy,

given the situation
between you two.

What situation?

-Oh, no.
-Is there a bathroom here?

This whole place is a bathroom.
Start talking.

You know,
you choosing your business

over seeing where things
could go with you two.

Kinda.

Am I still talking?

Max, please don't hit him
in his sex parts,

which, if I remember correctly,
is in his winkle.

Continue, Tyler.

I'm just saying,
what do you expect

from a long-distance
relationship?

If he's not moving here
and you're not moving there,

what's the point?

The point is that
anything can happen.

And maybe Randy will move here.
And even if he doesn't,

we're gonna have jetpacks
in, like, a year.

Everybody knows that.

(cell phone rings)

It's Randy.
I'm not getting it.

Or anything else tonight.

-Gimme that phone.
-Max, no!

I wanna remember what it's like
to be touched on the boob.

And not by a guy
at LensCrafters

who didn't even work there.

Hello, Randy.

It's the person that, uh,
chose her business

over seeing where things--
what was that, Tyler?

This is exactly how
my parents got divorced.

He wants to talk to you.

-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, Randy, can't hear you.

I'm going through a tunnel.

I wish.

Are you ever gonna
move to New York?

Are you ever gonna move to L.A.?

I asked you first.

Max, do you really wanna
do this now?

Yeah, now's not great for me.

Yeah, I do.
If I'm not moving there,

and you're not moving here,
what's the point?

So, I guess this is it.

I want a boyfriend
I'm not afraid of

dropping in the toilet.

-Oh.
-Yeah.

So this is good-bye.

I guess so.
Good-bye.

(phone beeps)

Why?

Why me?

-Should I go?
-No, I will.

Max, you and Randy
just broke up.

You can't go.

Unless you really,
really want to.

I need to be alone.

Maybe I'll go to a taping of
 Carson Daly.

Maybe we should have done this
at my place.

I live with my ex,
but she's a lesbian.

Not because of anything I did.

I'm still talking!

Let's let our bodies
do it for us.

(baby giggling)

See, she loves it.

Ah, can you believe
that Oleg still won't

buy the minivan?

Sophie, I'm telling you.

A van with windows?
What's the point?

Never had such a hard time
closing the deal.

Yeah, me neither.

Wow, you put out
your lunch cheese.

I like this guy for you,
Caroline.

You should have sex with him.

Don't love his outfit,

but he's only gonna be
wearing the belt, right?

Did you tell him
how long it's been?

I got five bucks
riding on this.

Max, you're really upset
about Randy.

Usually you high-five me when we
pass a "Rear Entry Only" sign.

After last night, I'm too upset
for sophisticated humor.

I feel like it's my fault.

If you hadn't set me up,
none of this would've happened.

It's not your fault,
it's your date--

I wanna say his name
is Triscuit.

It was Tyler.

Well, I'm sorry you didn't

get in the bone zone with him.

It's okay.
He was a talker.

And if I'm saying that...

And I'm surprised
you're taking this so hard.

You and Randy are more
on and off

than a jacket in early fall.

I must be feeling
a little better.

"Heavy Load."

(both laugh)

(car horn honks playfully)

Hey, girls.

Guess who just hit a guy
in her brand new minivan?

This thing is so smooth,
we barely even felt it.

Oleg, I thought you said
you'd only get a minivan

over your dead body.

And no offense, but we all
kind of got excited.

Jose failed to mention
that you could fit

a full-size mattress
back there.

(laughs)
Not a great salesman.

Let's park this thing
so I can show you the inside.

(engine turns over)

What the hell, man?

We have lit candles in here.

Han's with a girl?

Oh, ho,
that is one magic car.

You know what that means.

Even Han got sex
before Caroline.

(both laugh)

Who had 32 years for Han
in the pool?

Uh, I did.

He heard that?

Hey, Han, can Caroline borrow
that Yaris sometime?

Real soon?

(cash register bell dings)

Here's your check.

Sorry about the entire experience.

Ugh.

You're gonna have to take
it the rest of the way.

I slept funny last year.

You know, I happen to
be a massage therapist,

and I happen to be
broke, so what do you say

I get that crick out of
your neck as your tip?

I miss being able to just say no.

Hold on, I have to run this by a person

who's been poor longer.

Sadly, that guy over there is
offering me a massage as a tip.

Sadly-er, I'm considering it.

Sadly-est, you were here
when that old woman punched me

in the breast and then
asked for change, right?

We're not doing great.

There's got to be somebody
doing worse than you two.

Like that guy who got
left on Mars last year.

Question, girls.

I'm making a healthier menu.

Should I advertise no trans
fat, or does that sound like

I'm trying to keep out Chaz Bono?

Not now, Han, I have
a massage scheduled.

All the stress of acting
like you're working

starting to get to you?

Oh.

Oh.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah!

Oh yeah.

- Yes!
- Yeah.

Oh, yes!

Yes!

Oh... yes!

Yes! Yes!

Yes, yes, yes!

I just had what she's having.

Max, are you busy right now?

- No, I'm at work.
- Cool.

I'm gonna call a staff meeting.

I used to call my driver to pick
up sushi during Gilmore Girls,

but now I call staff
meetings at a diner.

Hey!

Only I can call staff
meetings at the diner.

It's one of the perks of the job.

Well, it's the perk of the job.

Well, it's okay.

The staff meeting is
about the dessert bar

Max and I are opening
in our cupcake window.

If you want, Han, you
can call the meeting,

but I can't imagine
you'd be petty enough

to take the thrill away from Caroline.

Staff meeting!

See, this is what happens

when the mother cat
refuses to lick the runt.

Okay, so I'm checking on
the dessert bar assignments

I gave everyone.

Earl, did you call your cousin

at that liquor distributor
about getting us a discount?

Now, why would I call him?

I owe him $10,000 and a kidney.

So that's a "not yet."

I haven't done my thing, either.

Caroline, with all your
money from Hollywood,

you could pay other
people to do this stuff...

and also replace the
transmission on a 2012 Yaris.

We have to save all our movie
money for the dessert bar.

Believe it or not, my boobs
can't get us zoning permits.

But they did get us kicked
out of an architect's office.

Oleg, did you talk to your
connection at City Hall

about expediting our liquor license?

Yes, she told me, "Don't
ever sneak into my home

through the bathroom window again."

Oh, this is rich.

Now you two see some
of the hell I go through

as a small business owner.

No, you go through hell
'cause nobody wants to

see your small business.

Staff meeting over!

Small staff meeting.

Max, your boyfriend is a lawyer.

When you're at his hotel tonight,

can you ask him to look
at our liquor license?

Also, could you fill an ice
bucket with mini shampoos

and bring it home?

No on both counts.

You're not using Randy for legal advice.

And as for the shampoo,
they switched to a pump

bolted to the wall, 'cause
I was getting greedy.

Hey, Randy.

Hey, Earl.

Saw your rant on Twitter last night.

And I agree; what
self-respecting Sizzler

runs out of Sprite?

I put that on Twitter?

I thought I was writing
an email to my brother.

Hey there, beautiful.

Mm.

So I thought we'd try
something different tonight.

You on top?

No, I'm not talking about changing

our whole power dynamic.

I'm talking about
staying at your apartment.

So, you on bottom?

'Cause that's where I live.

No, really.

We're living in a fantasy
world, that hotel room.

I mean, a really sexy fantasy world,

with people cleaning up after us

and a maid who knew
you from high school.

Boy, was she surprised
to see me naked and alive.

I know I always am.

And Max, I've been to your apartment.

It wasn't that bad.

Uh, okay, fine. We can stay at my place.

But it's BYOC.

Bring your own carbon monoxide detector.

Well, here we are.

Slum, sweet slum.

She says that every
time she walks in here.

It's usually to scare the
crack addict out of our kitchen.

Allen, are you here?

All right, well, this is it.

What do you want to do now?

We usually go to sleep
so death comes sooner.

You guys, I can handle an apartment.

Don't let my broad shoulders, stubble,

and Adam's apple confuse
you; I am, in fact, a man.

Coming up straight ahead is the kitchen.

But I don't have to tell you that.

You can smell the gas.

Fun fact: those paper towels
you see aren't actually paper,

but they do cause cancer.

Ooh, let me guess: the Grim Reaper?

No, the Grim Reaper comes
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Hey, girls.

And Randy. Oh.

Someone's been taking
his handsome pills.

Well, they make them in chewable now.

Makes it a lot easier.

Oh, Randy's here?

Hey, hey, hey, bro.

We should hang upstairs later.

We can eat pizza and watch dirty movies.

It's not delivery; it's DiPorno.

That's a hard no.

Girls, we need to store
some stuff in your place.

Oleg and I are
baby-proofing our apartment.

My mom baby-proofed our house for me.

She put a club on the steering wheel.

So in this duffle bag, I have...

He's opening it!

Randy, close your eyes!

Relax.

It's just swords

and sex toys.

Oh, I think one of them's both.

Are you referring to sex-calibur?

Oh, I love this one.

This is the sword we used

when we were playing
Bonan the Barbarian.

And you know what?

It's good to give to the
less sexually fortunate.

Yeah.

The sex toys are for you, Caroline.

I'm good, I had a massage.

Hiya!

What are you doing?

This is how all the great
ninjas eat their bagels.

Where's Randy?

Did he go back to the
land of not-expired milk,

and not-expired honey?

No, he's stronger than I thought.

Much like that little person I
arm wrestled at Chelsea Piers.

I love it here.

I just took the grayest
shower of my life.

Did you just say
"grayest" or "greatest"?

No, I said gray.

I was being kind.

It was brown.

All right, well, come on,
your sword bagel is ready.

God, I do miss having sex.

Also, what is the deal with...

Oh! God! Oh!

Ugh, I just stepped
on something painful.

Really painful!

Is there a nail sticking
up through the floor?

Oh no, he stepped on
Nail Patrick Harris!

Oh, I forgot to warn you
about that stupid nail.

It's been there forever. I
just know to avoid it by now.

Everyone does; that's why we named it

"Nail Patrick Harris."

Are you okay?

You look like you're in a lot of pain.

Do you want to roll the dice

with one of the pills in the couch?

I'm fine. It's not that bad.

Okay, well lift up
your foot. Let me see.

Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

Randy?

This is bad.

I think we have to
take you to Hapitalito.

Well, I must be losing consciousness.

That sounded like gibberish.

No, you heard me right,
I said Hapitalito.

That's our healthcare provider.

It's a guy with a shopping
cart filled with Band-Aids,

and most of them aren't used.

Max, I have insurance.

Well, I don't think he takes insurance,

but if you have old TCBY cards,

five is good for "uno surgeria."

Well, maybe it stopped.

I'm Carrie! I'm Carrie at the prom!

Caroline, come on, we have to go.

I'm already covered in
blood. Just leave me to die.

Oh, calm down!

If this had happened with any
of my regular type of guys,

you'd be halfway to Hep C right now.

Help! Help!

My apartment tried to kill my boyfriend!

He's gonna die!

I'm not gonna die, Max.

Although, this CVS bag
you tied around my foot

has completely cut off the circulation.

And the ten-foot receipt's
caught in the wound.

My boyfriend needs medical attention.

Oh, really?

I thought he was here
for a sensible pantsuit

at a reasonable price.

Oh, I recognize you

from the last time we were in here.

I wasn't attracted to you then,

but I see you've added
balding and a beard to the mix.

Ha, ha, I remember you too.

The devil wears Target.

We need a good doctor,

so he better not be from America.

'Cause he has insurance.

Show him the card, Randy.

Could I touch it?

Oh, good for you, a PPO.

You know, I cleaned up
some PPO right there.

Come on, this is serious!

He might have "Tetris"!

He's got the beloved
Russian puzzle game?

Are you sure he doesn't
have a case of the

Super Mario Brothers?

Well, there's a lot
of people ahead of you,

so why don't you take
your boyfriend's boo boo

and sit down?

Fine.

But he better not
die, 'cause if he does,

I'm gonna take those buttons
and pin them to your sack.

Promise?

Damn it!

I guess we're gonna be here forever.

The exact amount of time
Caroline's shower took.

Oh, so it's my fault your boyfriend

Freddy Krueger-ed all over me?

Caroline, I am so sorry.

That's okay, Randy.

You can make it up to me.

Right now!

I just so happen to have our
liquor license application,

if you want to take a look-see.

Do you also want to be pinned
to that albino's sack, Caroline?

Okay, coming through.

Okay, let me clear a path.

Now I know how my grandma Dorothy felt.

Oh, good, you're back.

Randy, are you okay?

Oh, I'm fine.

Did some shopping after you left the ER.

Like my new bag?

Ooh.

If you need a clutch to match,

I have something similar in Ziploc.

Because the nail was
rusted and the open wound

touched our floor, they gave
Randy an IV of antibiotics.

And not even a whisper
of Vicodin for old Maxie.

Well, Max, one of us has to go to work

and pretend both of us are there.

Well, it's gonna have to be you.

I can't leave Randy here.

It's like a haunted house,
but the dangers are real.

Max, you're going to work.

I'll be fine here.

I had a time-share with Sean Penn.

I'm not going anywhere.

It's my fault you got
nailed in my apartment,

and I'm staying here to protect you.

You're going to work.

I'll be okay.

But you're very cute
when you're worried.

Like when you thought the hotel
didn't get Cartoon Network.

All right, fine.

But call me if you need me to come back.

I'll tell Han I'm working the
rest of my shift from home.

Oh, my God!

I just remembered I didn't tell Randy

about the pothole in my bedroom.

Max, relax.

I haven't seen you this anxious

since the Dominos
pizza tracker went down.

Look, woman!

Randy came to New York to see
if our relationship could work,

but we never should
have left that hotel.

It's like when you go to
Vegas and wander off the strip

and wind up in a
residential neighborhood.

You can't come back from that.

It's how I wound up living
two years in someone's shed.

I suppose the motivational newsletter

I sent out this morning
didn't do any good.

I don't even know why I bother
publishing What's Going Han?

I like the comic strip
about the fat squirrel.

That picture was me!

It can't be you; he had nuts.

And that lady at table four ordered

before she started knitting
that sweater she's now wearing.

Oh, good, it's Randy.

Hey, I forgot to tell you,

you can't drink the tap water

within five minutes
after flushing the toilet.

Well, can you make yourself throw up?

Pickup: breakfast burrito.

Randy called our landlord

to complain about Nail Patrick Harris!

I'd rather see him host
something than Ricky Gervais.

We get it: you're mean, you fat bastard.

Randy called the landlord?

But we're illegal subletters!

We're squatters there!

And over most toilets.

Come on, Caroline, we have
to get to the apartment

before the landlord does.

You're leaving?

The tollbooth operator who won Powerball

stayed at their job longer.

Randy, we got to go!

I'll start packing!
You saddle up Chestnut.

Yeah, I know the drill:
one pair of shoes,

something you can carry on your back,

and a sun hat for Guatemala...

I mean, wherever we're headed.

Randy, you better drink up
the rest of the that IV fluid,

'cause carrying that around
is just gonna slow us down.

Max, what in the hell is going on?

Why are you freaking out?

I called the landlord about a nail,

not the FBI about your passport...

Frank Delaport.

Randy, we're not on the
lease to this apartment.

Oh...

Okay, I'm ready.

I just need ten minutes
to saddle up Chestnut.

It'll give me time
to practice my accent.

We're totally screwed now.

Thanks a lot.

This is why we should
have stayed in the hotel.

You could have screwed me
there and I would have loved it.

Max, I just didn't want you

to live with a nail
sticking out of your floor,

and I knew you wouldn't fix it yourself.

What is that supposed to mean?

It's like you don't realize

you don't have to live like this.

Oh, great.

It's like I'm in a relationship

with my high school guidance counselor.

Again.

You know, your life can
be a whole lot better

than you think it can be.

Why don't you just hammer the nail in?

Because we are used to it.

We just ignore it, like
the rain in my bedroom.

I knew my apartment
would be too real for you,

and now it's not even
gonna be my apartment.

All right, Max.

I put the double saddle on Chestnut,

filled the satchel with trail mix.

That should get us to the
George Washington Bridge.

Nobody has to go anywhere.

Not even your friend, the giant piñata.

- Let me deal with this.
- But...

we've never met this guy!

All we know about him

is that even the guy
in 2A is afraid of him,

and he was married to Kirstie Alley.

I can handle myself.

Hand me my fluids.

That sounded not manly.

Hey, sport, thanks for coming.

He can't talk his way out of this.

He's wasting his time.

He might as well be
trying to teach shapes

to Kendall Jenner.

No, no, you listen!

Well, Randy's dead.

No matter how many boyfriends
I bury, it's never easy.

I can't believe we're
getting kicked out like this.

In my fantasy, I bought the building

and opened a sadness museum.

Okay, that's it.

Took care of the landlord.

You killed him?

I'll call Oleg; we'll
get his friend's truck

and take it from here.

Okay, first, I believe that you have

and would cover up a murder.

But nobody's dead.

I just explained to him the situation,

and you're not getting kicked out.

All right, which one
of us has to marry him?

I'll go get my wedding sweatpants.

I just explained to
him that I'm a lawyer

who sustained an injury on his property.

Then I mentioned the
faulty wiring, the gas leak,

the various wildlife living here,

and, oh... that I'm a lawyer.

The word "lawyer" makes
people crap their pants.

It's like the juice
cleanse of professions.

And that is why you get the
next two months rent-free,

and you are now officially on the lease.

We're on the lease?

We're legit?

I have never been legit.

According to my birth certificate,

I'm actually a Cabbage Patch doll.

Thank you so much, Randy.

I'm gonna go tell
Chestnut the good news.

Chestnut!

How about that?

Your new name doesn't have to be Pablo.

Thank you.

I don't know what she would have done.

She is not made for the streets.

She's not even made for polyester.

This is awkward.

Just trying to get a horse
out of a tiny doorway.

All right, up.

I have to get back to the hotel.

Have you seen my protective bootie?

Wait, why are you taking your
booties back to the hotel?

Well, you're obviously not
comfortable with me being here.

No one's comfortable being here.

It's here.

Look, Max.

I wanted to stay here because
I wanted to see how you live.

Now I know you live on an
Indian food burial ground.

You know what? You're right.

My life can be better.

We don't have hammer money yet, so...

You know what time it is?

It's hammer time!

Well, that's the end
of Nail Patrick Harris.

Are you kidding?

With charisma like that,
he's not going anywhere.

I think we just got
through our first fight.

And only one of us had
to go to the hospital,

so I think that's pretty good.

I think that is pretty good.

You know what else I think?

I love you.

I love you too.

Aw!

That is so sweet.

I'll give you two some privacy.

I'll be in my room.

Caroline...

Even as a mime, you're still hot.

While you were at work, I
filled out your application

for the liquor license.

Randy, I love you too.

Sorry, the walls are
thin, and I was listening.

Hey, girls.

And Randy. Oh...

I'm gonna need my duffle bag back.

I hate to be an Uzbeki-giver,

but I really miss my vibrating pearl.

Are these supposed to
be doing other things?

Oh, no, does this mean
you want your swords back?

'Cause I was gonna
butter some toast later.

I'm sorry, Caroline.

We really missed our sex toys.

It's not as exciting when I just
put double-A batteries in Oleg.

That's weird.

Sophie's the one with sex toys,
I'm the one with the boyfriend,

and Caroline's the one who's wet.

Max, I have a surprise,
and it's right behind you.

Before I turn around, is it Oprah?

'cause I will die.

It's a diploma from pastry school.

No, seriously, what's the surprise?

I'll even take Gayle.

You would've graduated
if the school hadn't closed,

and Oleg knows a guy
who fakes documents, so...

You're a pastry school graduate,

And I'm a real estate agent
and a French citizen.

I'll be able to show houses in France.

And how are you getting there?

I'm also a licensed pilot.

Look, I am not a pastry school graduate.

I'm not even a high school graduate.

The only thing I graduated from
was a scared straight program,

which is why I'm not gay anymore.

Max, you really didn't graduate?

I always thought you were kidding

about dropping out of high school,

Like when you say that
Howard Stern is your dad.

'Cause he is.
Look at our eyes.

And I did drop out.

I was like, "Later, suckas. I'll find
a water fountain somewhere else."

Water fountains? Gross.

In private school,

We never bent down to put
our mouths on something

unless it had a yacht.

I didn't need a piece of paper
from high school,

and I don't need
this fake piece of paper,

because I don't fake things.

Except orgasms with guys
who don't know how to yank hair good.

Well, I'm glad you called back,
you slimeball.

Oh, good.

When you weren't here
when I woke up, I got worried.

So worried you decided to eat cookies

and watch Mama's Family?

We all grieve in our own way.

Guess I should cancel the strippers.

So I found out something
interesting today

that has to do with you.

Aw, crap, you found out
what happened in Orlando?

Why? What happened in orlando?

Don't tell me you
slept with Mickey Mouse.

Well, I slept with someone

with suspenders and four fingers.

I'm assuming it was Mickey.

Either way, it was heaven.

Well, I found out

that you're not
the badass you claim to be.

I talked to your old
high school principal,

and he said the only reason
you didn't graduate

is 'cause you failed to show up
for one history final.

My high school's still standing?

Guess I didn't flick
that cigarette far enough.

I cannot believe you'd invade
my privacy like that.

Invade your privacy?

You shave your junk with the door open.

So?

To the apartment.

Well, maybe you'll change your mind
when you find out that the principal...

Your old history teacher, Mr. Huck...

said you can come back
and take the test this Friday,

and if you pass,
you'll get your diploma.

If that's Mr. Huck,

I will murder your face.

Max, please don't kill me.

I can live here, but I can't die here.

Hey, girls.

I got Google Glasses.

See, right now, I'm looking at you

and ordering tapioca on Amazon.

Now is not a great time, Sophie.

Max is upset with me
because I'm trying to help her

graduate from high school.

Aw, you're sure she's
just not upset with you

'cause of the way you chew?

I'm sorry I have to chew, everyone.

I found out Max can go take
one history test

in her hometown, and then
she'll get her diploma.

Max, you know I've never been

a big fan of hers...

But I like the idea of
you getting that degree.

I mean, I'll never live down

not graduating from school for the deaf.

You're not deaf, Sophie.

I know. It was really hard.

Well, I don't care who she called,

'cause I'm not gonna do it.

And if Mr. Huck thinks
I would ever step foot

back in his Mr. Know-it-all university,

I have two words for him.

"Huck U."

That's what Mr. Huck said you'd say.

He also said that senior year,

you sold "Huck U" T-shirts

and that you have no ambition
and no follow-through.

That's when I knew
he was really your teacher.

No ambition?

I made enough off those shirts

to do nothing for, like, a month.

Look, I got two bus tickets
to Rhode Island.

I didn't even know you could buy
bus tickets ahead of time.

I thought you just showed up,
and if you looked like

you made enough mistakes
in life, they let you on.

Come on, Max.

I haven't waited this long
to hear someone say yes

since I was at school for the deaf.

Fine.

Fine, I'll go.

But only because
Mr. Huck thinks I won't.

Aw, okay, well, I'm gonna
let you two start studying.

And in full disclosure,

I watched some porno
during this conversation.

See ya later.

Hey, Max.

Caroline told everyone the good news

about you going back to take
that American history test.

Good for you.

Yeah, I started studying last night,

and on behalf of all white people,

I would like to apologize
for everything ever.

Well, apology accepted
for everything ever

except for slavery and the gap.

Here, Max, I brought
you the history book

which I'm studying from
for my citizenship test.

Aren't babies automatically citizens?

I don't know why I root for you.

Here, your country has a very rich past,

unlike Korea, which had
its past stolen by the Japanese.

Han, we are not talking
about European history.

We are talking about American history.

Oof, you're going to be
working here forever.

Good luck, lady.

Okay, Max, I've come up with a way

for you to work
and study at the same time,

like when you shop
and steal at the same time.

I know, when they show it to me
on those security cameras,

I'm always impressed.

I mean, I really don't know
anyone else who's doing it.

Max, pick-up. Burrito for table eight.

Ugh, jeez, I just walked in.

Why do I have to have
all this burrito drama?

First, Caroline says I have to quiz you

every time you come to the window, so...

Who was the sexually
virile male pop singer

responsible for the hit song
Jessie's Girl?

Rick Springfield.

Burrito's all yours, smarty.

Oleg, no.

You have to ask questions

from the flash cards I provided.

They're color-coordinated by century

and subdivided by president.

Don't look at me like that, Max.

I'm a fun person.
I taught myself the Dougie.

Okay, here goes.

Which amendment
to the United States constitution

Guarantees a woman's right to...

vote?

Wait, women can vote?

So when you say women can vote,

you mean, like,
besides for American Idol?

Max, you think you're
not smart, but you are.

You just need to come up with
little tricks to help jog your memory.

My memory doesn't jog.

I've smoked so much pot,
it's in one of those hospitals

learning to walk again.

What was the Great Compromise?

You mean besides you moving in with me?

It created the two houses of Congress.

Hooty-hoo!

Next question: What was the movement

against the sale or drinking
of alcohol called?

The bowel movement?

No, the Temperance Movement.

And don't mention the bathroom.

I've had to pee since
we passed that last town

that used to make something.

Just go to the bathroom.

What are you so afraid of?

The bathroom.

I will use a public bathroom.

I will use a public bus.

But I will not use the public bathroom

on a public bus.

Next card.

No, give me a twizzler. I know enough.

No candy. Study harder.

You're looking at a solid "D."

Well, my grades should match my boobs.

Next question. Okay.

In what city
was The Constitution written?

No idea.

Philadelphia?

Oh, damn it, I almost said that.

It's right there.

Philadelphia makes cheesesteaks.

The Constitution is cheesy.

Why do I doubt myself?

How much further?

I thought Rhode Island
was supposed to be a tiny state.

When are we stopping?

Well, we have to pass Cranston,

Providence, and then our stop is Hope.

Wait, Max, you were born
in a town called "Hope"?

Well, just outside Hope.

And success and money.

Well, there's no hope for me.

I have to pee so badly.

I'm going in.

Leave the twizzlers.

Here, study.

Oh, my God.

You know the toilet

isn't just there as a suggestion.

Wow, North East High.

Never thought I'd be here again.

This sure brings back no memories.

It's cute.

You know, in an underfunded
public school kind of way.

Wait, are you in high school?

Oh, my God, I'm 100.

Oh, there it is, 2-C.

Hold on.

Why are you covering those up?

They're the only reason
I passed chemistry.

Max Black.

Mr. Huck.

I'm surprised.

That I showed up?

No, that you're alive.

You and me both, sister.

And you must be Caroline.

Oh, you look just like the girls

Max used to give wedgies to
in the cafeteria.

Still does.

Oh, ladies, this is Hector.

Hector will be joining us today,

As he was not in attendance
during exam day.

Ay, yo, Mr. Huck,
that's 'cause my sister

didn't wake me up 'cause she's a bitch.

Very good.

Ay, yo.

This place is filled
with tiny tables, yo.

Oh, I'm sorry.

It's teachers and delinquents only

beyond this point.

You can wait out there.

- Are you nervous?
- A little.

I forgot I have a joint in my purse,

and I don't want to get expelled.

Max, you can do this.

I think you think you can't,

but I know that you can.

Look at me.

You are smart.

What are you?

Smart.

See, you already got one question right.

Okay, kids,

put on your thinking hats.

Ay, yo, I thought we couldn't wear hats

in the classroom.

I'm going to ignore that,
because if I don't,

I will weep.

"In 1775, Paul Revere
warned which two men

That the British were
coming to arrest them?"

In the Beastie Boys song Paul Revere,

He had a horsie and a quart of beer.

Sam Adams is a beer,
and if you have too much,

you end up giving a john a hancock.

Sam Adams and John Hancock!

I wasn't this nervous
when I waited for the results

of a Hep C test.

Then again, I didn't
study for that one at all.

Ay, yo, I think I nailed it.

You failed, Hector.

For real?

For really real.

You even got the answer wrong

that Max so graciously said out loud.

Aw, that's cool, Mr. Huck.

Next time, right?

Sure.

Max, I'm sorry to tell you that...

I was wrong to doubt you.

You got a "B".

You passed.

You lying son of a bitch.

[laughs]

It's true, Max.

In fact, I went over it three times

to make sure I wasn't insane.

Whatever that friend
of yours there did to help you,

It really worked.

I'm sorry,

But I can't stand out there any longer.

I've caused a small pandemic

of erections in freshman boys.

I passed! I got a "B"!

Now my grade matches your boobs!

I'm getting that stupid diploma

I said I didn't care about.

You can do more than
get that diploma, Max.

Graduation is tomorrow,
and if you stay overnight,

You can walk with the class
in the morning.

Uh, yes.

You want to go to graduation?

That's so me of you.

Well, I busted my "A" to get that "B",

and I want to get the whole package.

That's great.

Well, we'll see you
tomorrow at 10:00 A.M.

And, Hector, we'll see you
in front of the AMPM

asking strangers to buy you beer?

I call the bed. You can have the table.

Max, that bed is so tiny,
we're gonna have to spoon.

The only spoon
that's ever been in this room

was hovering over a flame.

Well, it's cute.

I'm not vaccinated
for anything in here, but...

It's cute.

And safe.

Yeah, they have cable,

and you can rent rooms by the hour,

so I used to come here
to watch Sex and the City

with a prostitute named Tiny Marge.

She'd bring me
banana bread and hang out.

It was fun.

Oh, great.

There's no coffeemaker.

Never mind, found it.

Your mom wasn't worried
when you'd come down here?

No.

She was a little jealous
that I was hanging out

with Tiny Marge without her, but...

The only thing my mom
ever worried about was herself.

She's selfish.

She missed my birth
'cause she "had a thing."

Come on, she can't be that bad.

Turns out, you're not that big
of a high school dropout,

And she's probably
not that big of a monster.

I mean, she raised you alone,
and you didn't die.

I did actually, twice.

But in fairness to her,
she wasn't there either time.

Max, why don't you invite
her to your graduation?

And don't say you don't have her number.

I know it's in your phone
under "Lady I came out of".

I also know I'm in your phone
as "Fart Monster."

That's because I know,
like, three Carolines.

No, you don't.

Busted.

Here, I'll dial,

you just leave the message.

- Here.
- No!

- Max!
- Fart monster!

Just do it. You'll be so happy
when you see her there tomorrow.

If we live through the night.

Hey, it's me, Max.

Brown hair, lived in
you for 7 1/2 months,

due to your inability
to read the warnings

on the side of cigarettes.

Listen, I'm graduating
from high school tomorrow,

So if you're not busy
looking for pills under the stove

or selling the neighbor's cat
for beer money,

Why don't you come?

Max!

What? That was a first draft.

Hit three, delete, rerecord.

Hey, it's me, Max.

Look, I'm getting my degree
tomorrow at the high school.

You know, that's the building
between the bar you drink at

and the bar you dance at, so...

Hit three, delete, rerecord.

Hey, it's Max.

I'm graduating
from high school tomorrow.

If you can make it, it starts at 10:00.

Okay, bye.

See, that wasn't hard.

This duvet is, but that wasn't.

How come they only give you
one of these?

Okay, Max, maybe don't say
anything else,

or they'll take your diploma back.

Okay, graduates, it's time.

Everyone line up alphabetically,

and let's make our way.

Oh, and congratulations.

You did it.

Max, you look so smart in that robe.

I'm not that smart.

I just found out you're supposed to
wear clothes under this thing.

Max, I never asked you.

You were so close
to getting your diploma.

Why didn't you take that test?

I was going to, but my mother

kept me out of school
that day to go to the mall.

On finals day?

Was there at least a special appearance

by Raven-Symoné?

No one good ever came here.

Just like my mother
didn't come here today.

There's still time. Maybe she'll come.

Maybe.

I mean, my dad was late

to my graduation because his helicopter

needed to refuel.

Yeah, that's probably
what happened to my mom.

But her helicopter's probably
passed out on top of her.

I have never been more confident,

because as I stand here and look out

at all of you today...

I was my class valedictorian.

I realize nobody can stop us.

Mm-hmm, yeah, I thought that too.

We are the future.

Mm-hmm, sure we are,
until you have to pee on a bus

in ten years.

Thank you, amy.

It's hard to imagine
not hearing that voice

Every day for the next four years.

Thank you.

Hi, Mrs.... Ms....
Max's mom.

This is Caroline Channing,
your daughter Max's

best friend and roommate
and business partner.

I didn't want to leave
this on a voice mail,

but I cannot believe you didn't show up

to your own daughter's graduation

when you are the sole reason

she didn't graduate in the first place.

I mean, who takes their daughter
to the mall on finals day?

What kind of mother are you?

And all the times
I've defended you to Max...

Not to make it about me,
but it was a lot...

Saying, "She's not that bad.
She's not that bad."

Well, I guess you are that bad.
Max is right.

You are a monster.

If you're on your way,
we're in the second row.

I have blonde hair.

Christina Bayers.

Whoo, that's my granddaughter!

Salazar Belmonte.

That's my boy!

Max Black.

Max Black.

Whoo-whoo!

That's my downstairs neighbor!

Whoo-whoo! Yeah!

So what, you called them all?

Yeah, you know, just in case.

Max, you were right, and I was wrong.

Your mother's really as bad as you said.

Mm, oh, it's not that bad.

What do you mean?

She took you to the mall on finals day.

Yeah, but it was the greatest day

we ever had.

We got ice cream,

we ate it in the massage chairs
at Brookstone,

and then a kid fell in the fountain,

and we died laughing.

Well, I guess you can
graduate high school any day,

but you can only watch a kid
almost drown in a fountain once.

It is okay that she wasn't
there today, because you were.

And none of this
would have been possible

if you hadn't pushed me.

And that kid wouldn't
have almost drowned

if I hadn't pushed him.

Little different.

Bottom line, you had faith in me

like Thomas Jefferson
had faith in Lewis and Clark.

Oh, no.

Now you're both nerds!

[knocking on door]

Okay, that's Mookie for the rent money.

I just found two fives in the couch!

Which brings us to
5, 10, carry the one...

a new low.

Hello, I'm Murray.

Did you order curry in a hurry?

I don't know. Is it paid for?

Yeah.

Then, yes, we did.

Max, you're awful.

We didn't pay for that.

It's Indian food.

We'll pay for it in three hours.

Any samosas in there?

You want some naan?

'Cause whoever ordered it
ain't gettin' naan.

[knock on door]

Did you guys see Murray
with our curry in a hurry?

Nope, sorry.

Just a heads up, the
samosas are a little dry

and also completely gone.

I need all the energy I can get.

Sophie and I are doin'
it 'round the clock.

She wants a baby so bad,

she even got an ovulation
app on her phone.

Sophie's phone has a fertility app?

My phone's so old
it can't get pregnant.

Tells us when she's most fertile.

Actually, a little
cartoon monkey tells us.

What's his name?

Overly curious George?

[monkey screeching]

Oleg, it's time. See?

The monkey's got a boner.

I'm pretty sure that's a banana.

It's yellow and he's holding it.
It's a boner.

Sophie, don't get your hopes up.

We've had so much sex,

it's basically just
steam coming out now.

Oh, you found the food. Good.

You mind if I use
your stomach as a tray

so I can eat while we do it?

Do I ever mind?

I have to block out so much now
just to get through the day.

[knock on door]

Wow, we have more visitors than

a mildly attractive
prostitute at Comic-Con.

(Mookie) It's Mookie for the rent.

Okay, Max, this time can you do

the blow-it-up hand thing with him?

I've tried it, but I'm just
not good at hand stuff.

Ask anyone at Yale PREP.

Just give it a shot!

You also thought you couldn't
eat food that's been stepped on.

Look at you now.

Sup, ladies? Sorry I'm late.

Some guy threw a cat at me.

Who's gonna blow it up for me?

I'm not allowed to
blow stuff up anymore.

My parole officer's rules, not mine.

[imitates explosion noise]

I know that was bad. I'm sorry.

Is there a class I can take?

I'll go get the last of the rent money.

It's either in my bra
pile, or I don't have it.

Take your time. We cool.

So, what kind of name is "Mookie"?

Is it short for something?

Long for something?

Max, hurry up, girl.

Okay, you should have $800

and here's the last of it.

Sweet. Well, I gotta go.

I got a tennis lesson.

Caroline, wanna try again?

[imitates explosion]

Make sure you get the whole $825.

No funny business down there, gangsta.

825? The rent is 850.

No, always been 825.

What's going on now?

Max, why do you tell me
the rent's 850 if it's 825?

Oh, yeah, I'ma go ahead and...

good luck with that.

You've been overcharging me rent?

It's not like that.

How is it not like that?

Okay, it's exactly like that.

Seriously, Max, other than the rent,

what else have you not been
telling the truth about?

You probably didn't even
see Emma Stone at Costco.

And is Max Black even your real name?

It's a real name.

Hey, in my defense,

you do have a bigger bedroom.

That's because I sleep
in the living room.

Can you just let this go?

So I took a little off the top.

Everybody takes a little off the top.

Look what God did to Han.

Don't drag me into the middle
of Pretty Little Liars.

I've got two ferrets at
home with the stomach flu,

and I don't need it.

Now everyone stop
what you're not doing.

I'm calling an emergency staff meeting.

Is this the whole,

"Don't ice your junk in the
food sink" thing again?

No, I have a rule.

20 warnings, then it's a dead issue.

This is about all of you.

We need to talk about diner teamwork.

Oh, our teamwork's fine.

For example, we're covering for Earl

while he chases the ice cream man.

♪ Got me a Chaco Taco ♪

Everybody, sit down.

Why? So we can be eye level?

Good put-down, Caroline.

See, Han? Teamwork.

All right, listen to our
latest Yelp reviews.

Daryl B. says,

"Sat in booth an hour
before anyone talked to me.

"When someone did,

it was the waitress
asking me for water."

I was thirsty!

And Daryl B. was real
slow with that water.

You don't see me Yelping about it.

I'll read one.

Caroline C. from here says,

"Max has been overcharging me
$25 a month for four years."

That sounds made up.

So tomorrow night,
I'm closing the diner,

and we're all working on
our team building skills.

So no one cares that

Max has been stealing
$25 a month from me?

That's correct.

[rock music]

♪ ♪

Right this way.

What the hell is this place?

This looks like the room I was kept in

when that trucker borrowed
me for three days.

Did you overcharge him too?

You'll all find out where
we are soon enough.

All part of the adventure,

and the mystery, and the...

did I say adventure?

Oh no, this isn't one
of those escape rooms

where they lock you in a room

and you have to work
as a team to get out?

Welcome to the Escape Room,

where we lock you in a room,

and you have to work
as a team to get out.

And so it begins!

What? Us beating the crap out of you?

Together, of course.

Now let me get this straight.

Y'all are volunteering to be
locked up in a tiny room?

See now, that's some white
people stuff right there.

It's a fun way for us all to learn

how to work together
to solve a problem.

If the group of us could work
together to solve a problem,

you'd be back in Korea.

I'm in no rush to get home to Sophie.

I mean, I love her and she's a fox,

but baby-making is brutal.

I'm so tired of having
my legs up in the air.

How do you... What do you...

How would that...
Let's just move past it.

Sign these waivers saying that

if anything happens to you,

it is entirely your fault.

Nobody's signing these waivers.
We're not idiots.

We're gonna read through
all the fine print.

(all) Done.

Here you go.

Oh, well, I'm gonna read mine anyway.

Caroline reads everything.

She read the entire iTunes user
agreement before she bought

Rihanna's "Bitch Better Have My Money."

Wish I'd read the fine
print when I agreed

to be your roommate.

Turns out, bitch do have my money.

Do I have to escape from this too?

I mean, is this part of the game?

Is this a bad time to tell you

your horse masterminded
the whole thing?

Before we start, I need
to collect your phones

so you can't Google answers.

Don't look at my screensaver

unless you have a strong stomach.

I've seen lots of phones.

It takes a lot to shock... Aah!

Why are your legs up?

Ah, white light means it's a go.

Hey, hold up! Aah!

Oh, one second.

You know, I'm breathin' harder

than Paula Deen on
Dancing with the Stars.

Sophie?

How did you find me here?

I told you to take that

"Find My Husband" app off your phone.

Yeah, well... I didn't.

Yeah. We're trying to make a baby.

Sophie, you can't be here right now.

This is a work team-building thing

and you're not part of the team.

- Right, Han?
- She can stay.

She does as much at the
diner as the girls do.

Well, I gotta stay close to Oleg.

You know, the monkey's unpredictable.

You never know when he's
gonna demand intercourse.

Well, that's a fun wrinkle.

Okay, this is the whitest
thing I've ever seen,

and I've seen those
shoes that have toes.

(Earl) Oh, hell no.

(Caroline) I'm feeling angry,
scared, and both of Max's boobs.

(Max) Is this our
version of make-up sex?

(Sophie) I can't see a thing!

Here, let me use my
pepper spray flashlight.

Aw.
[pepper spray fizzes]

(Han) Aah!

(Max) Hey, I'm starting
to like this now.

(Sophie) Hey! Look at all
those kooky light switches!

Let's try that!

Whoever this guy is says,

"Choose correctly
or lost five minutes."

(Max) Wow, you're no
whoever that guy is, Oleg.

(Han) 10, 20, 26 switches!
What other things are 26?

(Caroline) Hmm, that's one more dollar
than Max has been stealing from me.

(Han) How about something
a little more universal

and a lot less annoying?

(Oleg) There are 26
letters in the alphabet.

Thank you, Comrade Kangaroo.

(Caroline) Okay, 26 letters.
Which one could represent light?

(Han) Light starts with "L"!

(Sophie) Oh, wow, he's good!

(Caroline) Too easy. It's Einstein
so the answer must be scientific.

Wait, in Einstein's
famous formula E=mc2,

the speed of light is
represented by the letter "C."

A...B... C.

[gasping]

Oh, it's Alice in Wonderland themed!

I'll be great at this.

It was always my favorite story.

Sophie and I only watch
the hard-core porno version.

Yeah, it was called
Alice in Underpants.

And our dentist was in it!

[in British accent] That's enough

of all your chatter!

It's time to listen to the Mad Hatter.

I think it's the same guy as before.

Oh... Wow.

He's a genius!

You filled this room with illumination,

but you are not done
with this situation.

What rhymes with "kick in the crotch"?

To proceed and be done with me,

you must answer these riddles three.

Y'all know I'm 80, right?

One: Take it out of the package.

It goes in your mouth.

Chew it too long, and it will go south.

It's what Earl's doing right now.

Oh, Lord, am I peeing?

No, he's chewing gum.

"Take it out of the package.
It goes in your mouth.

Chew it too long and
it'll go south." Gum.

Exactamente.

That wasn't too hard.

Put your answer onto this card.

Well done!

This Groupon has already
paid for itself.

Two: Arnold Schwarzenegger's is big;

Michael J. Fox's is small;

the Pope has one but doesn't use it;

Madonna doesn't have one at all.

Dongs. The answer is dongs.

C'mon, Oleg, I mean
nobody can say for sure

that Madonna doesn't have one.

Dongs aren't the answer to everything.

I used to think that.

You know where that got me?

Pennsylvania, with no car.

Schwarzenegger's is
big, Fox's is small.

It's last names.
The Pope doesn't use his.

Madonna doesn't have one at all.
That's it!

Correctamundo. [chuckles]

With your brain power,

you'll be out of here in under an hour.

Well, thanks, but if I was that smart,

I wouldn't have spent
the last four years

getting ripped off by my roommate.

Oh, come on, are you
still on the money?

Oh, my God, my sister
lost both her thumbs

in a combine accident

and she didn't talk about it this much.

Ah, here's $25.

Let's call it hush money,

so hush.

First of all, this is $12,

and fine,

you won't hear a peep
out of me anymore.

Fine, I don't care if we never get out.

[monkey screeching]

All right, FYI,

yeah, Oleg and I are gonna get
really Amsterdam-y up in here.

All right, we gotta get the hell out.

Come on, Caroline.
Where's your sense of whimsy?

And don't say Max stole it,

because that's getting
older than Randy's accent.

Sorry, Randy, I knew you
were a safe person to slam.

Time moves forward. It doesn't go back.

You've got 15 minutes.
It's 45 that you lack.

[scoffs] Come on, guys.

We don't need Caroline
to solve these puzzles.

This is the same team that was able

to figure out the Wi-Fi password

to the women's shelter
next to the diner.

Who said this?

"If it was so, it might be;

and if it were so, it would be."

The fat twins?

'Cause that made no sense

and they look like
they get stoned a lot.

[monkey screeching]

Okay, Oleg, drop your pants.

The monkey wants his banana.

Caroline,

if I have to see Oleg so much
as honk one of her boobs,

I'm gonna lose it.

I would help you, and
be your heaven-sent,

but you screwed me on the rent.

What is it gonna take to
make you get over this?

You haven't even apologized.

Okay. I am sorry.

Are we good?

You know what? No, we not good.

(all) Aw, come on!

Fine, I'm the only one here
who knows this story,

and I'm the only one who knows
how to get out of here.

There, the rabbit hole,
Alice went down and so will I.

That's it.

This is a bigger bust
than Max's future.

Just like Alice,
I'm sick of being stuck

in this upside-down world

when your best friend
lies about the rent.

- No, you can't!
- Oh, yes, I can.

I bid you adieu.

No, seriously, don't!

Ooh, I'm next!

I don't mean to burst your bubble,

but your friend's in a lot of trouble.

What I'm saying is:

that's not part of the room.
That's just for show.

You're not supposed to jump in it.

I'm not next.

So that's not a cute rabbit hole?

Rabbits? No.

Couple of rats, though.

This place is a deathtrap.

Caroline, please tell me you're okay.

(Caroline) I can't, because I'm not.

I'll use the emergency code
to get us out of here.

5...9... 4... 7.

[alarm buzzes]

Okay, I'm gonna be real
honest with you right now.

I don't know the codes.

(Caroline) Help, there's
something moving down here!

I'm going in.

Sophie, give me the
pepper spray flashlight.

All right, yeah.

Hurry!
[pepper spray fizzes]

That really does sting.

[monkey screeching]

Okay, Oleg, now it's time.

It's that beautiful moment

where you and I are gonna make a baby

right in front of your coworkers.

Can we have a little more class

and wait till we get in the cab?

What?

We're gonna do it on top of teacups.

That's pretty classy.

[grunts and moans]

What is happening?

You know what?

Spray some of that stuff in my eyes.

Max, look.

Oh, that's why his leg's up in the air.

I've seen enough. I'm out.

[shrieks] Ow!

Ugh, I think I landed
on what was moving.

So that's dead now.

Oh, my God. Are you okay?

Yeah, I think. Are you?

Yeah.

Wait, you said you weren't okay.

I meant emotionally.

I jumped into a floor hole for feelings?

Well, my feelings are really hurt, Max.

It's been four years.

Well, I don't know what to do,

because like the Sad Hatter said,

time goes forward; it doesn't go back.

I can't undo the rent thing.

I just thought we were
in this together,

50/50.

We are,

and I should have told
you four years ago,

but I thought we wouldn't last a month.

But then we did, and
then another month,

and I'm still not sure
how this happened:

we became best friends.

Max, that's the first time
you've ever called me

your best friend without a bribe,

and that's worth a lot more than money,

and you know how much I love money.

Yeah, you almost ruined
our friendship over it.

All right, come on,
let's get out of here.

Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

I'm not okay.

Searing pain, searing pain.

Ugh, I think I twisted my ankle
when I jumped down here.

Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

You're right.

Sometimes sorry just doesn't cut it.

So how are we gonna
get you out of here?

If you want me to carry you,

you'll have to take off your boobs.

Which way should we go?

My sense of direction led me
to being a waitress in Brooklyn.

You know what? Let's go forward.

'Cause much like the
time, you can't go back.

Also, the moving thing just
came to and looks mad.

Go.

Max, I've never been this
close to your butt before,

and it's spectacular!

What's your secret?

I'm 27.

(Sophie and Oleg)
[moaning and grunting]

(Han) I really shouldn't be seeing this.

(Earl) Can we please turn
the lights back off?

(Sophie) Oh, God, help me!

Well, one good thing
about being down here:

Sophie and Oleg are up there.

Wait, why is the floor sagging?

[both screaming]

Oh, my God.

You know, I'm pretty sure that fall

knocked the baby right up into me.

Correction, if I could
turn the clock back,

I wouldn't go back four years.
I'd go back 30 seconds.

[rock music]

Okay, everybody,
gather round.

Who knew it was "bring
your girlfriend to work" day?

She is not my girlfriend.

Judy is a CPR doll,

and the hardest-working girl
in this diner.

Oh, Han, you shouldn't bring
your sex doll out in public.

This is not my girlfriend
or sex doll!

Earl, come over.

We're going to use Judy
to learn how to resuscitate.

I have a "do not resuscitate"
clause,

as in,
I do not resuscitate others.

Oleg.

What's up, Han?

Oh, hey, Judy.

How do you know Judy?

With a torso like that,
she gets around.

Okay, I will demonstrate.

Oh, no!

Judy's choking on something!

Well, we know it's not you.

First you have to tilt
the head back

and clear the airway
and blow.

[gasps]

Oh, Max, I think
we're witnessing

his first kiss.

Fourth, thank you very much.

Han, why are you wasting
your time kissing her?

She doesn't have any arms.

Just go for it.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

What's up, everybody?
Big day today.

Not as big as Christmas,
but still marks the arrival

of someone very blessed: me.

Yeah, we get it.

You talk about your birthday

more than Kanye West
talks about Kanye West.

Caroline, I thought
you would be crying.

Tears on your birthday
have become as expected

as an ex-Disney star going
to rehab.

Why would I be sad?

I have my health,
a business that's budding--

Boobs that aren't.

I don't believe in birthdays.

You're only as old as you feel.

Which makes me
nothing years old.

Speaking of nothing...

Caroline, are we still on
for Two Boots pizza tonight?

I'm closing the diner early
in honor of your birthday,

and just not because the city

has demanded to look into
the black mold situation.

Absolutely, Han.

You can have one slice
with two toppings

or two slices
with one topping,

and my birthday cake
is a free flan

'cause I flirted
with the dishwasher.

Caroline, sweetheart,
if I was you,

I would just put my head
through a plate glass window.

Okay, everybody.

I have two announcements,
both good news.

First, the guy who found
the beak in his sandwich

is not suing, and second,

I'm gonna pop the question
to Sophie.

Well, you've already popped
everything else.

What do you think?

They say diamonds
are a girl's best friend.

Oh, really?

I thought a girl's best friend

was someone
just a little fatter than her.

It was my grandma's
from Russia.

I had my cousin Svela
swallow it

to bring it to America.

She passed customs,
then she passed this.

Five, six rinses later,
boom!

Doody free.

Well, I guess that's better
than getting it at Kay.

Is Sophie expecting it?

Of course.

She doesn't like surprises

since her family barn
was torched

by a mentally unstable
farmhand.

Hi, I have a delivery
for Caroline Channing

from Martin Channing.

Oh, it's a birthday gift
from my daddy

all the way from prison.

Last year, he made me

a macaroni art
picture frame.

I mean,
the man once rented Miami

for a friend's bachelor party.

Hey, that picture frame
fed us for two days.

Yeah, well,
this thing is not pasta,

and it's too big
to fit through the door.

And so was I
three months ago.

No, really.

My seat on an airplane
used to be Row Three.

There it is
in the street.

A condom full of hamburger meat?

Oh, my God.

Is that a Lamborghini?

Wait.

Is that my Lamborghini?

Yeah, it's a Lamborghini
Aventador Roadster.

Wow.

Prison arts and crafts
has gotten pretty fancy.

Well, it takes four years for
these cars to be custom-made.

This one was ordered in 2011.

That's right,
my father ordered this for me

when he still had money.

Correction: When he had
everyone else's money.

All my father ever gave me
was that one iffy chromosome.

Well, here you go.

It's all yours.

I'm gonna walk home.

It's all about healthy choices.

[both squealing]

I got a car!

We got a car!

Damn, someone painted
the Batmobile white.

Can't we have anything?

That's a $450,000 sports car.

I know.

Add a stackable washer/dryer
and a motor home,

and it's like Caroline won
the Showcase Showdown.

It goes from 0 to 100
in 2.9 seconds.

And speaking of seconds,

I'm getting seconds
at Two Boots,

and that rich bitch is paying.

Back off, Tokyo Drift.

This is our getaway car.

And by that,
I mean get away from it.

You know, a car like this
depreciates 50%

the minute you drive it
off the lot.

That's why I drive
my Toyota Yaris.

Ooh la la.

[gasps]
Is P. Diddy here?

Wait a minute.
Is it Ted Turner?

No one cool owns it.

It's Caroline's.

Now, this is the kind of car

that I would say yes
to anything in.

Anything excepts tickets
to Menopause The Musical.

Oh, hey, Caroline.
Nice car.

I always liked you
more than Max.

You know that, right,
girl?

Really?

'Cause yesterday,
I heard you yell to Max,

[imitating Sophie]
"Is Caroline turning 47 or 48?

'Cause she acts like she's 65."

Yeah.

Yeah, I wanted to know what
to write in your birthday card.

Well, everyone
away from the car.

I just got off the phone
with my dad.

The car is being seized
in the morning.

Turns out they won't let me
keep my present.

It's just like
my eighth birthday

when they made me return
Mccaulay Culkin.

They bought you a boy?

You were rich.

Oh, boy, the car's right here,
and you can't even use it.

That's like me having you two
for waitresses.

Caroline, can I ask you
a favor?

You're not using the car
to propose to Sophie.

You heard how much
she liked it.

And it's a little bit classier
than my original plan:

dinner and a cock fight
in Yonkers.

Not that I'm listening,

but I'm not gonna get
proposed to at a gay bar.

Great, now my gay bar idea
is out also.

No, Oleg.

I can't return the car
with scratches, dents,

or chlamydia.

But we can still drive it,
right?

I mean, I've been on that cream
for like a month.

Max, what is the ninth rule
of the Lamborghini Club?

No red drinks
in the car.

Here's my number one rule:

If you're going to make me
sleep in it,

I am going to drink in it.

Well, just be careful.

I only have one Clorox wipe

that has to last
till my next birthday,

and it's already lost
a lot of its moisture.

I don't see
why we have to just sit here.

We can't drive it.

My dad said
if anything happens to it,

we'll be responsible.

What could possibly happen

on a weed run
to deep Tijuana?

You know, I wish
this car never came,

and I wish I never sat in it.

It's the same reason
I don't go to Barneys.

I don't like to be around things
I can't afford anymore.

Same reason I don't go
to the 99 Cent Store.

There's a Nerf tennis set

half on the floor,
half in the bin,

none of it going home with me.

I was trying to be positive
about my birthday this year,

but, Max, if things
hadn't happened with my father,

tonight would have been
a magical birthday for me.

Hey, there was some magic.

I personally made
five vodka Sprites disappear.

Ta-da!

I would've got in the car
and driven out to the Hamptons,

and we'd sit on the beach
all night

having lobster caught by
one of the townies

and drink champagne
while taking duckface selfies

till the sun came up.

FYI, I'm the townie
in this scenario,

and I hate all of you.

Instead of doing any of that,
I'm having the worst birthday.

I probably feel worse
than Demi Moore did

when she turned 50.

Yes, just go to sleep.

You'll feel better tomorrow
when you wake up.

I mean, if that guy
with the switchblade

doesn't come back
like he promised he would.

Caroline.

Caroline, wake up.

[water crashing]

We're at the beach.

I drove us out
to the Hamptons.

Happy birthday!

We're in the Hamptons?

[shouting]
We're in the Hamptons?

How are we in the Hamptons?

How long have I been sleeping?

Three hours, give or take.

You farted twice.

How did I not wake up?

I know.
It was pretty bad.

After that last one, I thought
we were going through Egg Town.

Max, you did it again.

You roofied me, didn't you?

Of course I did.

You were crying
and babbling about the Hamptons,

so I had to put you down.

You promised you wouldn't again.

The last time,
I was out for two days.

Yeah, I really just needed
to get through Game of Thrones

without someone
talking during the incest.

What is wrong with you?

Have you got a pen and paper?

You knew I didn't want
to do this.

You never want to do anything,
so I did it for you.

You took a $450,000 car,

a car we're not even
supposed to be touching,

on a joyride to the Hamptons?

You wanted to be here.

You are here.

Just enjoy it.

I can't enjoy it.

Scotty to the bridge.

This is Captain Kirk.

Scotty to the bridge.

You drove over the dunes
and onto the beach?

Not intentionally.

I tried to stop it,
but this car was like,

"Mm, no, girl."

Oh, my God.

Did it get any scratches?

Max, get out of the car,
and help me look for scratches.

You said you were more fun
in the Hamptons.

Not true.

Mr. Sulu,
fire all phasers.

No scratches.
The Lamborghini is fine.

But thanks to you,
I'm a Rent-A-Wreck.

Come on, we have to get
this car back.

We will.
Jeez, relax.

We still have time.

Look, you said
you wanted to be here.

You're here,
and we are not leaving

till you do something beach-y,

like walk in the water

or find a half-eaten lady
from Jaws.

No. No way.
Let's go.

Just take off your shoes
or something.

No.

Just take off your shoes
and feel the sand.

Max! Max, stop.

I haven't had a proper pedicure

since Justin Timberlake
released a single.

There.
Now move your foot around.

No.

No. No! No.

Oh. Oh, yeah.

That feels nice.

The cold sand between my toes.

But, Max, don't look.

That middle nail's
a horror show.

Too late.

I thought it was a pistachio
for a second.

Max, how much do you love
the beach?

I don't know.
I've never been to one.

You've never been to a beach?

No. What's the point?

I don't own a metal detector.

Well, time's up.

But we just sat down.

I know, but if we leave
right now,

we'll still have enough time to
blow through

a McDonald's drive-through

like something from
Back to the Future.

Well, I'm gonna write
our names in the sand

'cause it was
a really nice thing

for you to drug me, kidnap me,

and steal my car
to get me out here.

Hey, we're friends.

All right, I'll just
turn this baby around.

[engine revving]

Uh-oh.

What's "uh-oh"?

What is "uh-oh"?

Are we stuck in the sand?

You have correctly identified
the meaning of "uh-oh."

I love that we don't need
full sentences

to communicate anymore.

Try it again.

[engine revving]

Nope.

I've had less trouble

getting out of
athlete's apartments.

Well, you're gonna have to
get out and push.

Why do I have to push?

Because you're the one
who drugged me, kidnapped me,

and stole my car.

Exactly.

I've already done
the lion's share of the work.

And it's our car.

Fine, I'll do it.
[engine stops]

Door's up, Lieutenant Uhura.

It stopped being funny
when we got stuck.

God, don't worry.

I got a 600-pound woman

out of a booth at the diner
with my bare hands.

I'm fearless.

Toss her in neutral
like I did with that lady.

Sand and heels.
Not a good combo.

Not a good combo.
Not a good combo.

Oh, all right.

All right.

I'm gonna floor it.

[engine revs]

On the count of three.

One, two...

[engine revving]

I got excited.
I went early.

If I had a dime
for every time I heard that,

I could buy this car.

All right, let's try again.

One, two...

[engine revving]

[coughs]

Okay, that was on purpose.

A little bit.

I can't believe it.

I can't believe
that I can't believe it,

but I really can't believe it.

We are in very big trouble,

and we're not even in
the good Hamptons.

I was trying to do
something nice.

First time, last time.

You know what you are?

You are reckless.

You know, all this time,

I thought you were
a ride or die kind of bitch.

I am a ride or die
kind of bitch.

What's a ride or die
kind of bitch?

Are you Googling
"ride or die kind of bitch"?

I would be,
but I only have two bars.

[sighs]

Look, we have two options:

Get the car out of the sand,
or let the tide take us.

Put a pin in
that tide thing,

'cause I like the sound of it.

We barely have enough time to
get this car back to the city,

or we owe $450,000.

And I only have $3,
and 2 of it's in nickels.

Now get in the car.

You're hoarding nickels,

and I'm walking out of
the 99 Cent Store empty-handed?

Now I'm mad.

Get ready.

What are you doing?

I'm pushing us out of here.

[engine turns over, revs]

Because I'm a ride or die
kind of bitch!

I think.

[grunts]

Now hit it!

[engine revving]

What'd you do?
Fart us out of the ditch?

Seriously, Caroline,
step on it.

No, Max.

We can't risk
getting into an accident.

What if it's not fatal?

Driving a Lamborghini slow
is like going to Red Lobster

and not getting
the Cheddar Bay biscuits.

Come on, we got to enjoy
this car while we can.

Hit the gas.
- All right.

I'll take it up to the top
of my age dating window.

40.

And I'll take it
to the top of mine.

80!
- [engine revving]

Let go. Have some fun.

No, don't push on my leg!

Don't push on my--
[screaming]

[laughing]

Yes! Yes!

Best birthday ever!

Should we Thelma and Louise it?

You mean drive over a cliff?

No, I mean wear sunglasses
and hold hands.

They drive over a cliff?

I never saw the end.

There they are.

Did you girls get the car back
in time this morning?

Yep, just in time,
thanks to Caroline.

She was ignoring
speed limit signs

like she does homeless people.

A state trooper called
my driving

criminally negligent.

I was so proud.

I might've even
gotten emotional,

but I had to talk our way
out of the ticket,

and I like to be professional
when my shirt's off.

[chuckles]

You didn't get a ticket?

Yesterday, I got arrested for
just walking into Whole Foods.

I can't believe
I still have sand in my hair.

If the only place you still
have sand is in your hair,

you're lucky.

I'm about to make a pearl
down there.

Oh, hey, there,
destitute Barbie.

Sorry you lost the dream car.

Anyway, I'll be in my booth.

Sophie, beautiful baby,

I've narrowed down
the site of my proposal

to three options:

A, the place we met;

B, the place we've had sex
most often;

or C, the place we've had sex
most recently.

Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

All three of those places
are this booth!

That's right.

Sophie Kachinsky...

He's proposing at the diner?

What's he gonna do?
Put an onion ring on it?

[inhales sharply]

Oh...

I love that.

You know, I was planning on
saying no

and making you beg
for a few hours...

I just love you too much.

Aw, that's so
not as gross as normal.

Now it is.

[cash register bell dings]

Max, your boyfriend is naked and waving
from the dumpster he calls his apartment.

Make sure it's Deke.
Last time you said that, I went over,

and it was just a naked meth head
in a normal dumpster.

I mean, we had a blast,
but still.

Well, at least that meth head
bought a bunch of cupcakes.

I mean, he thought they were alive,
but he bought them.

- Hey, I'm gonna cut out early.
- You're sleeping over again?

Seriously, Max, sleeping in a dumpster?
Are you trying to bring SARS back?

Well, I did bring it in
the first time,

and that is the last time
I hook up with a bat in Thailand.

Hey, Max.

Season 3, Episode 15
"And The Icing On The Cake"

Synced by Reef


Max is 45 minutes late.

And she better not say
she have a prostate exam

'cause I'm not falling
for that again.

Relax, she's just down
the street at Deke's place.

You know how it is when you first
start sleeping with somebody,

and you can't keep
your hands off each other...

Yeah, just take
my word for it.

I know I couldn't keep my hands
off my first love.

I'm talking, of course,
about my penis.

I've had enough!
You two girls walk all over me.

A baby can walk
all over you.

Hi, everybody.

Oh, I just heard two hobos
getting freaky in the garbage.

Sophie,
that was Max and Deke.

Oh, I get it.

You gotta do crazy things
to keep it fresh.

You know, I once had sex
on a bus, and I was driving it.

Boy, were those kids
late to school.

That's it, I am marching over there
and putting my foot down with Max.

No one has sex
on my clock.

Well, maybe your clock's
not big enough.

That's it.
No more free jell-o.

Max!

Max, open up.
I'm very upset.

More upset than that time
you enrolled me in Little League.

Hey, it was your decision
to play the full season.

Oh, goody, I was hoping for some
hecklers at this, my lowest moment.

Hey, if the dumpster's rockin',
don't bother knockin', baby.

Hey, man.

Hello, little girl.

I'll take three boxes
of Samoas and a thin mints.

Don't forget
my tagalongs.

They're called
peanut butter patties now.

Why must I be that person?

- What up, fools?
- Hey, girl.

Max, you're 48 minutes
late for work.

Look, little Debbie,

we're in here preparing for a big
pastry school competition tomorrow.

And having sex.

And if you ever interrupt me
while I am studying...

And having sex.

Again, I will dropkick
your baby-powdered ass

back to the Shire
with the other hobbits.

I told her.

Did you?

All flowers must be set on top
of the cakes by the time we call "time."

Everyone,
final touches.

That's what I used to say when
I finished my shift at Hooters.

Hot. You still got
that uniform?

Oh, not sure it'd fit me anymore.
I used to have really big boobs.

Bebe, how much time
is there left?

For all of us?

Oh, oh, gosh,
I'd say two months, tops.

No, no,
for the cake competition.

- Oh, 60 seconds.
- Only 60 seconds? Come on!

I'm sorry, I can't handle
this pressure.

It's only a matter of time before
I start eating my eyelashes again.

The winning team will earn
a free week of class.

And also... how do you say...
Bragging rights.

Hurry! Move
faster, Lindsay Slow-Hands.

Forget about it, Big Mary.
These competition is ours.

Deke and I are broke.
We need this more than you.

15 seconds!

Oh, bonjour, Caroline.
This is a real treat.

Mm-mm, uh-uh, don't do that.
You're married.

I'm only here in an official capacity.
Bebe's in an emotional ball in the hall.

- Ten seconds!
- Come on, girl.

Bring it home, bring it home,
bring it home, bring it home!

I am way too excited
about this.

Okay, everybody.
I see a clear favorite here.

But, Caroline,
in truth,

if I were to pick the prettiest
flower in the room, I'd pick you.

That is... Incredibly obvious

and incredibly accurate.

Oh, come on!
Get a stairwell!

- Your timer.
- Merci.

Just tell us who won.

The winners are,
I am very happy to say...

Max and Deke.

You were amazing!
I love you.

I love you too.

Wait, you do?

Do you...?

Yeah... I do.

Yeah, well, I do too,

so suck on that.

Okay, two important things.

One, I'm the guy you've been
talking to on OK-Cupid.

And two, I need five minutes
of girl talk

and not a minute more because
I'm worried it'll turn me into a girl.

Go. Tell me. Leave nothing out,
leave everything in.

I said something today
I never thought I'd say.

"Thank you"?

I said "I love you"
to Deke.

He said, "I love you,"
and I said it back.

Oh, cool.
Good for you.

Wait, that's it?

I finally decide to cave and be a girl
for you, and you hang me out to dry?

I've seen movies. You're supposed
to jump around and say,

"This calls
for a Margarita!"

This calls
for a Margarita!

Too much, too late.

Your first reaction said everything,
and your second one was just annoying.

I'm sorry, I just didn't think
you were taking him so seriously.

He has no money. I mean,
the man lives in a dumpster.

You are such a snob.

It doesn't bother you
he has to move his house

every Tuesday
between 10:00 and 2:00?

No, I've always wanted
to travel.

Come on, you can't really be
in love with him, right?

I mean,
you can't love Deke.

Max, you're in love with that cute
mochaccino homeless guy with the Jew-fro?

He is not homeless. He lives
in a beautifully decorated dumpster.

So homeless?

I get it.

You know, I used to be engaged
to a man who lived in the sewers.

Yeah, the heart wants
what it wants.

Plus he told me he was friends
with the Mutant Ninja Turtles,

and they were
a huge deal at the time.

At the time?

If he can introduce me
to Donatello, get him back.

How did you know
you loved this... Sewer man?

Well, he made me laugh.

He was very passionate,

and I wanted
to be with him constantly.

Probably because he got me
hooked on heroin.

That was a crazy summer.

See?
I feel the same way.

Minus the heroin part,
unfortunately.

Hey, can I use your bathroom? I have
to tinkle, and there's a wasp in mine.

Go ahead, Sophie.

What's that look?
Is the wasp behind me?

I can't believe you.

Even after three years
of being friends with me,

you still have a thing
against poor people.

Max, you love him, I can love him.

I just have to get
to know him better.

Invite me over to the garbage can
for a wine and cheese party.

Wait a minute.
Wine and cheese party?

Oh, I'm gonna bring
my new boy toy.

He's the Caesar salad pepperer
at the Olive Garden.

No dates, Sophie.

The place is so small, I once
accidentally took it home in my purse.

This camembert smells like feet,
so you know it's good.

Look at you, Mayor McCheese.
So fancy.

It's just the usual diner crew,
you know.

We serve
imitation imitation crab.

Well, I just wanted
to class the place up for you.

You know, get some wine,
get some cheese, flush.

You did not need to do that.
I love that you live here.

And if a dumpster was
good enough for me as a baby,

it is still good enough for me
as an adult.

Oh, you love that I live here.
Do you love anything else?

Well, I loved The Karate Kid movies
until Will Smith's kid ruined them.

Okay, can we please be serious
for a minute?

Did you just say "I love you"
because I said it first?

Look, honestly, yes.
But I definitely meant it, I think.

Look, I suck at this stuff.

This and not laughing
when kids fall.

Just know that if/when I say it again,
I will mean it.

I can totally wait...
I love you, Max.

Nice try, sneaky.

Oh, hi. Come on in.

And be nice.
Remember, you barely have a bed.

Don't worry.
I love this area.

I met your neighbor,
the mattress.

Oh, that queen?

So would you like a cabernet
or a Shiraz?

Shiraz.

Oh, that's a real name?

Some interesting pairings here.

In fact, I'm looking
at one as we speak.

Please, someone else
come right now.

Hi, everyone!
I'm here.

Please, someone else
come right now.

I brought some homemade
kimchi bin dae duk.

Would you like to try it, or should I
just throw it right into the garbage?

It took me a year to get this kind
of smell out of here, but thanks, Han.

Oh, what a dump.

I thought of that
on the way over.

All right, let's do this.

I'm ready to rage
all night, baby.

Oh, hell no.
I am too old for this.

Sophie, watch your head.
You might wanna take your heels off.

Take my heels off?

Communist Russia couldn't get me
to take my heels off.

Hey, Earl, you wanna go
get drunk somewhere

we don't have to bend over
till we want to?

Indeed, I do.

Not to brag, but I'm the only one
who can stand up in here.

Cool brag, Han.

- So, Deke, tell me about yourself.
- Hey, stop Guantanamo Bay-ing him.

Well, I go to pastry school,
I live in a dumpster,

and I was thrown out of One Direction
for being too handsome.

- That's about it.
- There must be more to you than that.

I mean, I'm surprised to see a Roquefort
cheese paired with a 2001 Syrah

from the Rhone region of France
at a dumpster party.

Where'd you learn
about wine?

Well, I wanted to impress you, and
I keep my adult grape juice game on point.

So where are you from originally? Did
you grow up in a storage facility or...

Will you stop?

He looks nervous like
the fat guy at a birthday party

when he finds out
there's a pool.

Coming, coming.

Good.
We have the right dumpster.

I brought some wine.
Bebe brought cheese.

Kind of.

Hey, guys, thanks for inviting me.
Happy to be included.

All right,
another babe.

Throw your keys in the bowl.
Right now, it's just me and Han, and...

That ain't happening.

What is Nicolas doing here?
Hide me.

I think you're gonna
run into him.

- Sorry, I thought you were into him.
- I'm not into him.

Please, Caroline, relax.
It's just a party. I'm here as a friend.

- Then where is your hand?
- On your beautiful bottom.

Sorry, it's crowded. It was
either there or in the sink.

- Please remove it.
- I-I did.

That one's mine, baby.

Come on, it's 8:45,
and nobody's got their tops off.

Somebody's gotta
do something.

Oh, one time I played
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

Well, I got hit by a bus, and
I was dead for seven minutes.

Bebe, do you want some wine?

Sure, why not? I don't have anything
to do tomorrow except move to Canada.

What?

Yeah, no biggie. Long story short,
they found me.

Caroline, looks like it's gonna be
just you and me in the office.

Nicolas, please. What did I
tell you about your hand?

That's me!

I was trying to push my way
to the cheese.

Hey, Bebe Gun, if you're ever in Alberta,
hit the Fairmont at Banff... super fun.

I got wasted and cannonballed
into the lake there once.

It was frozen.
Shattered my pelvis.

Good times.

Hey, I know that place.
Fairmont Chateau on Lake Louise?

We used to winter there.
That's a really exclusive resort.

I once saw them tell Barbra Streisand
to take it to the holiday inn.

Caroline, you want
some of my triple crème?

I don't want
any of your crème.

You know what, it's getting
a little crowded in here.

I'm just gonna slip out
without anyone noticing.

Oh, excuse me.

Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me.

Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

So...

Deke... what do you think?
Do you like him now?

Well, before tonight, I thought he was
the guy who walks around singing,

"When you're sliding into home and your
shorts are full of foam, diarrhea."

Now I find out he knows
all about cheese

and has been to this massively expensive
resort, so I'm even more confused.

What's confusing?
The foam is diarrhea.

Caroline, wait.

- Let me walk with you.
- No, no, no. I'm good.

Please, at least take my scarf.
It's cold.

No, I'm fine...

- Are you okay? Here, let me help.
- No, Nicolas.

I am not going
to be the other woman.

Despite the fact that I am literally
lying in trash, I am not trashy.

Caroline, listen.

Things aren't always
what they seem.

Just because that is garbage
on the outside

doesn't mean that it cannot be
a nice apartment on the inside.

Just because I'm married on the outside
doesn't mean I'm married on the inside.

Life is complex.

Your whole thesis is hinged
on the fact

that I think that dumpster
is nice on the inside,

which I don't.
Good night.

- Oh, Caroline...
- Nicolas, please don't beg.

- I just...
- Maybe another world, another life.

- I want...
- You can't leave your wife for me.

- No, it's just...
- Seriously! You don't have to say it.

No, I do.

You have a diaper
on your back.

I am aware.

What are you working on there? Is that
a family having a picnic at a park?

No,
it's the letter "G"!

I haven't written anything
by hand since 1996.

Well, my writing's really good. I forge
a lot of checks and prescriptions.

I'm kind of a famous doctor.

___

You're really saying it.
That says, "I love you."

No, it's Khloe Kardashian
windsurfing.

Yes, Deke, I love you.

Oh, Bebe.

I wasn't expecting you today.
I thought you moved.

I'm on my way. My car's outside, but
I remembered I left my medication here.

Okay, now where's
the big one?

Well, as long
as you're here,

could you show me where
the student financial files are?

Sure, they're here in this folder
I've labeled "Depressing."

I wanna check Deke's file
and see if he's on scholarship.

He's definitely
not on scholarship.

His family's super rich.
He's a Bromberg.

Wait, Bebe.
Bromberg?

I thought Deke's last name
was just "Berg."

As in "Ice-" or "Pitts-."

No, he just goes
by Berg for short.

You know, like me,
my full name is Bebebebe.

So you're telling me Deke
is from the Bromberg family,

as in the Bromberg Elevators... the ones
that are in every building in the city?

As in the Bromberg Colo-Rectal
Center at the New York Hospital?

Yeah.

You know, I once left a purse and
2 feet of my large intestine there.

Nice knowing you.
Bye.

Ooh, I'll be right back.

If you mess up our batter,
I'll cut your thing off.

Sweet, I could stand
to lose 5 pounds.

I have some exciting news
to share.

Unless it's about an off-season
Shamrock Shake, I don't care.

Your Deke... dumpster Deke...
is actually Deacon Bromberg.

Of the Manhattan Brombergs!
He's rich!

What are you talking about?
That is crazy.

I would know if he were rich. I wouldn't
have just told a rich guy I love him.

It's all right here.
Isn't this amazing?

This is like buying a dress you love
and finding out it's rich.

___

- Whoa, why'd you do that?
- You're rich.

- Max, wait.
- You pretended to be poor. Liar.

Ooh, lordy be.

This kind of drama's the reason why
I quit the Ohio State Football Team.

Why are you so upset?

Lying about being rich
is at most a little white lie.

It is literally the whitest lie I have
ever heard, and it's a huge deal.

I never would have fallen in love
with someone who has money.

We are drastically, massively,
monumentally different people.

Hey, Max, can we talk?

Oh, I don't know.
Depends on who I'm talking to.

Am I talking to Deke or Deacon
Bromberg, the elevator king?

Man, if you're this upset
about the money,

how are you gonna react when
you find out I'm really a woman?

We wouldn't care.

I never tell anybody I'm rich
until after we say I love you

because I don't want money
to change anything.

Money changes everything!

Now excuse me.
I gotta do my second job,

which you wouldn't
know anything about.

Don't you have
an Ascot Convention to get to?

Still here.

Also, two customers
just showed up.

We don't need their money!

We're big, fat liars pretending
to be poor too.

Mm, yeah,
my mom invented dogs.

Any time someone buys a dog,
we get 10%!

Now I can't believe it.

Even after three years
with me as a friend,

you still have a thing
against rich people.

Mm-hmm, I do,
because rich people suck.

They think they're better than
everyone and are generally sucky.

So he has money,
I don't want it.

Again, just wildly
different people.

And, Max, just because
he's rich on the outside

doesn't mean he's not like you
on the inside.

Life is complex.

I don't wanna see you right now!

Hey... I don't wanna
see you either!

Just toss me some chocolate
with some cream in the middle!

And speaking of cream
in the middle...

Your little homeless boyfriend
is tryin' to get your attention.

___

He's not homeless, he's not
my boyfriend, he's rich.

Rich...?
And he's single...?

Oh, maybe I will
take off my heels!

Hi! Today's special is clam chowder,

and today's advice is: Don't eat it.

Do you have Eggs Benedict Cumberbatch?

You are really killing it tonight, Mary,

and leaving no evidence.

We're coming from Sherlock-con.

It's like Comic-con,
but for Sherlock Holmes fans.

So it's way cooler.

Excuse me for a sec.

There's another waitress here
who is gonna be

a big fan of all of this.

You're welcome for what
I'm about to show you.

Look, guess what they are.

Time-traveling lesbians.

We're not lesbians.

I am.

What is this?
What just let out?

A sale at the Burlington Coat Factory?

They're Sherlock Holmes super-fans
coming from a convention,

which means there are a lot of cats
home alone right now.

Well, I'd say the only mystery
is who here gets laid the least.

Hello.

Cracked it, Watson.

Synced and corrected by backinblack


One of those Sherlock ladies left
her carpal tunnel brace in here.

No address, but there's
a card that says,

"in case of emergency,
dial 1-800-chocolate."

And I'll take that.

Okay, everybody.

It's that time again.

The diner's big spring clean!

Oh, my God, has it been
six years already?

Too bad I just developed
carpal tunnel.

Max, do you think
you can fake a stroke?

Fake a stroke, fake an orgasm,

basically anything that will
get me out of work.

Okay, we have lots of chores to do,
and somebody will have to double up,

because earl asked me not to speak
to him for the rest of the night.

Didn't I tell you to keep
my name out your mouth?

So, girls, what do you say
we make it fun, huh?

I'll read a chore.
You raise your Haned.

Scrape the fat puddle
from under the stove!

No takers?

Next.

Clear the spider community
in the walk-in!

No takers?

Next.

Clear the spider community
in the dish room!

No takers?

Han, sorry, I can't clean.
I have carpal tunnel.

The doctor says I can't put
any pressure on my wrist.

And I can't clean either, Han.
It's my jaw.

I've got real bad "T.M.Z."

Oh, you girls are so full of crap,
like that third stall in the men's room.

Any takers?

She was so friendly
in the job interview.

Bonjour, Max.

Oh, Chef Nicolas.

Why am I seeing you
outside of pastry school?

Is it about my flan?

Because no one likes that stuff anyway.

Oh, no, that's not why I'm here.
I want to speak to Caroline.

But, yes, I gave your flan a "C"-minus.

It was flat.

Hmm. I'll go get her. Wow.

First time a teacher's
ever called me flat.

Ow, ow, ow!
Oh, my wrist!

Oh, I thought you were Han.

Please, I'm twice the man he is.

Nicolas is here.

What? No, no, no!

He can't be in my personal life!

I'm having a hard enough time avoiding
working with him at pastry school.

Did I just call the diner
my personal life?

I think so. I wasn't listening.
So what do I tell him?

Tell him he's married,
and I don't go out with married men.

Tell him what we had
was a passing flirtation.

Tell him now it's over,
and he has to move on.

Got it, you died in a grease fire.

She's not here yet.

Oh, well, will she be coming?

Will she be coming?
Nope, not anytime soon.

Okay, I'll text her.
Au revoir, Max.

Sir, don't take this the wrong way,

but you are one fine-looking man.

Well, thank you very much.

And back at you.

Tell me something I don't know.

Look at this.
Nicolas already texted me.

"Will you have dinner?"
what should I do?

Just ignore it, like I'm doing
with that table

That's flagging me down right now.

I'm putting a stop
to this Nicolas thing.

"I'll have dinner with you
when you leave your wife."

And se-end.

If you ever say "se-end" again,

We're not gonna be "fri-ends."

Hey, everybody!

I just got back from Sundance.

I saw ten Mark Ruffalo movies,
and I got to watch Catherine Keener DJ.

Whoever that is.

I was in an indie movie once.

Well, a guy filmed me eating a sloppy joe
in the dressing room of a sport chalet.

Sophie, how did you get
into the Sundance Film Festival?

Oh, I'm dating one of the bigwigs.

He drives the Miramax party bus,
and he wears a big wig.

So I'm thinking about producing
my own movie.

You know, getting into the biz, babe.

Sophie, if you need an actor,
let me know.

But I'll only do full frontal.

I'll also do partial frontal
or just penis close-ups.

And if you need someone to play God,
a judge, or an old guy sitting on a porch,

I'm your man.

Everyone, keep piping your cakes.

Keep piping.

Max, vite, vite.
You need to pipe that more.

That's funny, because
my high school guidance counselor

told me I need to pipe way less.

Max, you are falling behind today.

Where's your Deke?

In my pants, where it always is.

Oh, you mean Deke.

He's got the flu. It's everywhere.

No one can shake it.
It's like Taylor Swift.

Yeah, or Pitbull.

Okay, everyone, that's time.

I will see you all tomorrow.
Au revoir, class.

Au revoir, chef.

Let's go. Let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

Come on, come on, hurry.
Let's get outta here.

What's the hurry?
You sound like my mother

whenever the real people who lived
in the house would come home.

We need to leave now,
while Nicolas is in his office.

I don't want him to see me.

I said everything I needed
to say to him in my last text.

Ooh, I smell scandal.

So I've been hiding
in the stairwell all day.

Guess where those stairs go.

A room where ten Vietnamese
women are making next year's "Prada."

And they do not like visitors.

Oh, is that where you were?

'Cause he asked me,
so I told him you were pooping.

Max, don't tell him I'm pooping!

There's no shame in it, Caroline.
Everyone poops.

I don't.

I just eat, digest,
and then an angel comes

and takes it away in the night.

Excuse me, John. This is private.

It's just between us girls.

I know.
That's why I'm standing here.

Okay, I'm ready. Let me just grab
the medicine I got for Deke.

Aw, that's sweet.
You got him antibiotics?

No, I got him Vicodin.
I want him to feel better.

I just have to make it
down the hall

until the elevator
without Nicolas catching me.

Oh, like sexual Frogger.

Game over.
Your frog just got hit by a car.

Caroline, there you are.

I can't help feeling you're
avoiding me or something.

Avoiding you? No!
I've been...

pooping.

For five hours?

She had a reluctant stool.

Oh, is that not helping?

Caroline, I have something to tell you.

Can we talk?

We're all waiting.

You know in your text
how you said that you won't

have dinner with me
while I'm still married?

Better clear some space on my DVR.

There's a new scandal.

Well, you can have dinner with me,
because I'm leaving my wife.

Uh, hello?
What happened?

Dude told you he was
gonna leave his wife,

And you left faster
than Vladimir Putin at a gay bar.

It's all a blur. I blacked out.

I don't even know how I got here.

I think I took the train, but, Max,

I might have taken the bus.

It came out of nowhere.

I never expected him
to leave his wife.

It came out of your thumbs
when you texted it to him.

Look, when I texted him that,
I was just being flirty.

Flirty is me not wearing underwear
To the times square M&M store.

So you really don't want him
to leave his wife?

No!

I mean, sure, maybe I fantasized about it,
but in my fantasy we were on a ski trip,

and I was jumping up and down, excited,
With my best friend Jennifer Lawrence.

Cool, maybe call Jen next time
the possum traps you by the garbage cans.

Look, I thought we were just
having a fun distraction.

You know, a couple kisses,
a dry hump here and there.

Oh, like the cheerleaders
with the good grades.

Exactly. I'm not the type of person
who wants him to leave his wife.

No, you're the type of person
who almost wants him to leave his wife.

Yes! Yes, that's me!
I'm the "almost" girl.

I almost lost my virginity 25 times.

This was my conversation with
my friends every Monday in high school:

"Did you?"

"Almost."

Funny, 'cause I almost
went to high school.

Max, I have to figure out
what to do about Nicolas

before he almost makes a big mistake
and leaves his wife.

He's not leaving his wife for you.

It's just a thing you say
to pretty women to get them into bed.

Like, "I'm a Russian prince,"

or, "That was a good story."

With a tank top collection
like yours,

I'm surprised
you have to say anything.

I know, right?

So you don't really think
he's serious about leaving her?

No. I've told dozens of women
I'm leaving my wife for them,

and I'm not even married.

Here in America.

That was nice of Oleg.

Just when you think you've seen
every part of a person,

'cause he's shown you on his phone,

he surprises you.

Oh, I feel so much better.

Nicolas is not going to leave her.

No, why would he leave her for you?

Well, you don't have to be
nasty about it.

Max, I just got another text
from Nicolas about him leaving his wife.

Oleg, now he says he's telling his wife
tomorrow at 4:00 that he's leaving her.

You got a timeframe?

Oh, if he puts a clock on it,
it's happening.

Pick-up, cantaloupe.

Max, there's a clock on it.

But isn't his wife in France?

Yeah, but they skype every day.

They're like the French Jetsons.

He's gonna skype break up with her?

That is low.

And smart.
Might steal that move one day.

Oh, good, I see your wrist is better,
and I'm gonna need some help.

The cleaning situation
has gotten a little complicated.

The spider communities are at war.

Han, I can't clean.

I'm in the middle
of ruining someone's marriage.

Then, Max, please.
Things are escalating quickly.

There was a discarded piece of ham,

and apparently both kingdoms
thought it was theirs.

Oh, no takers?

All right, enough with all this texting.
I need to stop this.

I have to go over to his place tomorrow,
and tell him face to face.

Tell him face to face?

I don't even have sex face to face.

I hope Nicolas takes
my breaking it off with him okay,

because in my fantasy when I told him,
he wouldn't take no for an answer,

bought me a plane, and I gave
Jennifer Lawrence a ride home.

In my fantasy,

a talking dragon gave me a cape
That belonged to Jesus.

But that's probably because I took
too many of Deke's Vicodin earlier.

The lobby told me
you were on your way up.

Caroline, I did not expect you.

But you knew I'd be coming?

We need to talk, and Max is here
for moral support.

I know how this works by now.

Come in.

Okay, how do I put this?

How do I put this? Nicolas,
I came here today to tell you...

to not do that.

But why?
I want you so much.

Okay, you...
You don't want me.

You don't even really know me.

I do. You're sexy
and funny and pretty and smart.

Okay, you know me a little.

Look, I am not the type of person
who breaks up marriages.

No, she's the "almost" girl.
She almost breaks up marriages.

Yes, yes, that's who I am.

So I don't want you to make that call,
and break up with your wife over Skype.

I am not breaking up with her
over Skype.

Okay, great, perfect.
No skype.

No. Because that's her in the lobby.

I'm breaking up with her in person.

Oh, my God, that's your wife
in the lobby?

Your wife is here?
What are we gonna do?

Calm down. I can fix this.

You need a fake mustache,
a fistful of paprika, and a new passport.

If you don't have
all three of those things,

I can make it work with two,
as long as one of them is a mustache.

There's no other way out.

Come on, Max, we have to get
out of here now.

Oh, oh, yeah, and, uh...

Don't leave your wife for me.
Whatever we had, it's over.

Oh, and...

This shouldn't reflect badly
on me in school,

'cause I worked hard for that C-minus.

Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

Okay, but only because she just
got out of the elevator.

She can't find me here.
I can't be this girl.

I don't want to be the whore
he's leaving her for.

That's my favorite Dr. Seuss book.

Caroline, what are you saying?

You were just leading me on
this whole time?

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold it, Pep� Le Pew.

And, yes, I've been saving
that one for after finals.

It is not just Caroline.

You've been chasing after her harder than
a fat kid in a rolling doughnut contest.

- That's true.
- Wait, wait, Caroline.

Do we still have a shot or not?

No.

Then better go hide in the bathroom.

I don't want this screwing up
my marriage.

What?

Well, if you're not going
to be with me,

I'm going to have to stay
with my wife.

I mean, I'm a man.
I cannot be alone.

Now, go, go, go.

She cannot find you here
in our apartment.

Why don't you just tell her the truth,
that nothing happened between us?

She will not believe me.

I have a history.

There are two of us here.

I also have that history.

Nicolas, c'est moi.

Now go, please. That's the least
you can do after ruining my life.

Almost.
Almost ruined your life.

Come on, Max.

This is totally inconvenient.

My "C" better go up to a "B."

This is crazy, us hiding
in a married man's bathroom

like a couple of cheap floozies.

So far, I'm just hearing a factual
depiction of what's happening here.

Let me see what's going on.

I can't understand them.

I thought you spoke French.

Only enough to impress Americans.

Je dois utiliser les toilettes.

Oh, my God. Les toilettes.

Les toilettes, that's where we are.

She's coming in here!
What should we do?

Pretend we're hot plumbers?

Hide in the shower.

I think she might notice us.

You know that's all glass, right?

Let me just get you
a clean hand towel.

She has to pee-pee.

She can't come in here to use
the toilet, 'cause my life is in it.

I know, this is unfortunate.

So go out the window.

What?

It's not a problem.

There's a ledge wide enough
for you to walk

to the neighbor's terrace,
jump, and get away.

Stephanie did it.

Who's Stephanie?

That's... not important.

She's fine.

Now go.
You have to go.

Unless you think
you and I still have a shot.

I'll be on the ledge.

Come on, Max.

No way, not happening, Lucy.

If he loses his bad marriage,
I'm responsible.

Almost.
Almost responsible.

Max, I wouldn't even be
in this situation

if I wasn't working with him
to put you through pastry school.

Oh, so this is my fault?

Max, please just let it be your fault.

It's completely doable.

By the way, it's raining.

Come on.
We can do this.

We've crawled 15 feet on our roof
to get illegal cable.

Yeah, for the Breaking Bad finale!

Something worth dying for!

Oh.

Oh, my God, are you insane?

Get back in here!

Max, maybe you're right.

We should've taken
the hot plumber route.

I'm coming back.

My legs won't go!
Max, help me back!

Damn it.
Damn it, bitch.

She's in the bathroom.

Oh, she closed the window.

And she locked it. So go.

Go, go!

If Stephanie did it, we can too.

I can't believe we're up here
all because of him.

I am such a bad judge of character.

Of course you are.
I'm your best friend.

Max, I'm sorry.
This is bad.

Well, at least it can't get
any worse, unless we fall.

- Oh!
- Or it starts to hail!

Ow! Ow!
Hurts like "hail!"

It's clear! Come on!

I don't wanna die!

Me neither!

That's weird.

For the first time in my life,
I don't want to die.

I have a boyfriend and my first "B."

Oh, God, I'm getting soft!

I can't die!
I haven't made my comeback yet.

In my fantasy, you and I move into that
penthouse I bought from Jennifer Lawrence.

Right over there,
with the roof garden, see?

Are you two all right?

I mean, whoever you are.

Am I dead?

Almost. Almost dead.

Oh, my God.

What happened to you two?

Well, we crashed through a window.
It was pretty dope.

It was kinda like a Die Hard movie,

if they ever let girls do
cool stuff in those movies.

The necks all right?

We have whiplash, and I have
some bruises on my back.

Max took the brunt of the fall
but feels nothing,

because she's mostly made of Vicodin.

Well, I'm glad you survived,

because I don't know what
I would do without you around here.

Aw, thanks, Earl.

I meant you.

I know.

Max, how were you ever strong enough
to hold me up with one arm?

It's the arm I used to drag my mother
out of bars with as a baby.

Well, I want to say something to you.

I hope you know that if you were
the one that slipped on that ledge...

I would be dead.

Well, I'm glad that's out in the open.

Everybody!

I have an update about my life!

Oh, whoa.

What happened to you two?

Sophie, we had an accident.
It's a long story.

Yeah, all of yours are.

Well, I'm out of the movie business.

I broke up with my bigwig from Miramax.

We got in a huge fight,
and he threw his big wig at me.

He told me I'd never eat lunch
in this town again.

And I said, "Hey,

if I'm in town,
I'm eating lunch, baby!"

Oh, no.

No, no, no, I don't have
spider bites over half my body

So you two could fake another injury.

Nice try.

Oh!

Ooh, I'll bet that hurts.

Evening, ladies.
Gals' night out?

Chasing guys, eating pie,
having fun.

This table is sticky!
Run a damp rag across it!

Would it kill you
to clean a little?

What kinda place is this?

The kind that serves soup cold.

And what's with
your crazy earrings?

What are you, some kinda gypsy?

Whoa!
Hold up, ladies.

You don't get a bitch pass
just 'cause you're old.

Yes, that's right.
I said it.

You come in here with
your gangster granny attitude,

think you can get away

with dumping all over
the lowly gypsy waitress.

No way. At this diner, we don't
discriminate due to age.

If you're gonna act
like an ass,

I'm gonna treat you
like an ass...

No matter how close that ass
is riding to the floor.

Now, I'll wipe off the table
we'll take it from the top.

Hi, I'm Max.
Who wants tapioca?

That's more like it.

Save the disappointment
for the grandkids.

Earl, I need another book
of checks.

The last one fell between
the refrigerator and the oven.

I'd reach for it,
but that falls between

"I don't do that"
and "Oh, hell no."

Look overthere, Max.
Men and women in suits.

This neighborhood is
definitely on the rise.

I remember a time when a black man

couldn't get a cab around here.

And that time was Wednesday.

Max, I was just talking to
the smart couples in booth two.

I know they're smart because
they're the first people in here

who ever ordered the croque monsieur

as croque monsieur and
not "crock monster."

They wanna meet the woman
who made the cupcakes.

I told them you'd be right over.

- Go! They're so nice.
- No, they're not nice.

They're trendy, blood-sucking locusts

who come into this neighborhood
to pillage and destroy

crashed my 21st birthday.

What?

You made these cupcakes?

Yeah, what's the problem?
Spit it out, I've got a life.

We just wanted to tell you
that your flavor palate is...

amazing.

I don't know who you are
or where you came from--

Neither do I.

But these are fabulous.

Well, welcome to the neighborhood.

I knew I liked you guys.

So what did the trendy locusts want?

You are so judgmental, you know that?

They wanted to tell me the
cupcakes are "fabulous."

Thank you.

Maybe now you'll finally start to get it

if someone besides me
tells you how good they are.

I believe the word was "fabulous."

Pick up, Max.

Oleg, from now on, you
may call me Countess Max

of the Fabulous Cupcakes.

And you may call me Sir Oleg

of the Amazing Party in My Pants.

Caroline, the happy,
shiny people in suits

asked me to give you this note.

Oh, what a great idea!

They suggested we sell Max's cupcakes

at the cool new coffee
place in their building.

But you already sell
cupcakes here in my diner.

Han, we're building a cupcake
business that will one day

get us out of here.

That's what we're trying
to do with our lives.

But I thought we
had something special.

Yes, but we're not exclusive.

The diner's cute, but
I want more than this.

Oof.

First girlfriend all over again.

Hey, Johnny.

Max has the tables against the wall.

Oh, we're good in your section.

Caroline, I want you
to meet my buddy Carlos.

Hi.

Well, I'm working the counter.

What's happenin'? Come on, dude.

You have a literature degree from NYU.

I didn't mean to say
that, but when I get nervous,

my Rico Suave comes out.

It won't happen again.

And here's two menus.

What's happenin'?

Dude, I'm nervous.

Hey, guys, I'm in
that section over there.

Oh, we're good in Caroline's area.

Well, if you like hot
coffee in your pants area,

you're in the right place.

Actually, I like that.

Coming right at you.

Johnny's in your section.

Yeah, why?

He comes in here every night to see you.

He's your friends
or...crush or whatever he is.

Shh! He's not a crush. He's a...

I don't know what he
is, but whatever he is,

he's in your section.

- Max!
- Ooh! What are you doing?

You're not supposed to be in here.

I know, I'm a bad boy.

Look, the reason I'm not
sitting in your section

is because my buddy Carlos is
crushing pretty hard on Caroline

and he asked me to do
what I can to hook them up.

Oh. So now you're a bartender,

a street artist, and a pimp.

Ain't nuttin' wrong with me
pimpin' some boy on the side.

Keeps me in spray paint and whatnot.

So?

From pimp to pimp...

Help me out with your girl.

My girl don't come cheap.

Is it hot in here?

Yes, and we're in a freezer.

Yes. My freezer.

I was, uh, just talking to Max.

Um, I'll see you out there.

So is this what you like in the men?

No. He's just a
customer that went rogue.

He is weak and girlish.

A woman like you needs a real man.

You know what they say.

Once you go Ukraine, you
will scream with sex pain.

That probably lost
some of its sensual appeal

in the translation, but
thanks for the offer, Oleg.

Cute, but I'm not interested.
Besides, he's not my type.

Just say it.

You're not interested in him
because he's Puerto Rican.

Where did you get this idea

that I would only date white guys?

For your information, I've
dated all kinds of men.

I once had a Spaniard in Monte Carlo.

Isn't the title of an Abba song?

Are you sure about this? He's cute.

And trust me, you could use a
little salsa in your white rice.

Max, I just lost every dollar I had.

The last thing on my
mind right now is guys--

any type of guy.

Except this guy.

Hi, Chestnut.

I'm much more concerned
with our business

and getting my head back above water.

Men will come sooner or later.

Well, according to my
research most men come sooner.

Oh, I thought we should stop by

that new coffee place tomorrow
and introduce ourselves

and your cupcakes.

I'm not gonna walk in there.
I feel like I'm selling out.

Okay, let's reframe
the phrase selling out

and make it sold out,

as in "Max, we sold out of the cupcakes"

and are now successful."

What's that you say?

I can now afford to buy
the wax dental floss again?

Fine.

But I'm only doing it so
you'll eventually get your mind

off the business and get laid.

Why do you think I
need to get laid so badly?

If I'd just gone through
all the tension and trauma

that just happened to you,

I'd be climbing telephone
polls to take the edge off.

Trust me, sex is the last
thing on my mind right now.

Oh, and speaking of reframing things,

I have a surprise.

I redecorated my room.

I scoped out some cheap
fabric in bedding places

down on Houston Street.

What do you think?

I think you've made a vagina.

What?

Sister, you may think
that sex is the last thing

on your mind, but you turned
your bed into a vagina.

Do you think my vagina has curtains?

I don't know how long it's been.

I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

Okay, but I still
have to make the cupcakes

to bring by that place tomorrow.

I don't wanna keep you awake

so why don't you sleep in my bed tonight

and I'll pass out on your vagina?

Okay, but you better buy
me breakfast in the morning.

I love this place. Looks
like Paris in the '20s.

More like poseurs in their 20s.

Man, they've really
cleaned this place up.

You've been here before?

Yeah, it used to be a liquor store

owned by this old Irish guy

who had freckles on his penis.

Sometimes he'd corner you and flash it,

but then he'd always comp
you a free lotto ticket.

Okay, well, let's try and keep

that sort of charming nostalgia

out of our sales pitch.

Oh, that's the owner.

I scoped it out before you got here.

And remember, I'll do the talking.

Why don't I get to talk?

Freckled penis.

And besides, I have more experience.

All those who pitched business
models to Warren Buffett

as a member of the Phillips
Exeter Entrepreneurs Club

raise their hands. Holla!

Well, if you care enough
to raise your arms about it,

fine. You talk. I won't say anything.

Hi, what can I get for you?

Hi, I'm Caroline and this
is my business partner Max.

- And you are?
- Semhar.

- Oh, jeez.
- Such a pretty name.

It means "light of
the tiger" in Sanskrit.

Oh, jeez.

It's my yoga name.

Help me, God.

Well, Semhar, we just opened

a local neighborhood cupcake company.

Our card.

We're introducing our exciting product

to local boulangeries.

Please try a sample. Max.

Would you like
coconut-coffee, chocolate-curry,

or blueberry-lemon zest?

My absolute fave is the coconut-coffee.

Let's start with that, shall we?

Thank you, but no thank you.

Well, can I ask you why?

They're not pretty enough.

Excuse me?

They're not pretty enough.

Perhaps if you tried one,

you'd see how amazing
our flavor palate is.

Hold off, Flava Flav.

What do you mean,
they're not pretty enough?

They have a charming homemade look,

but my customer would prefer

a more upscale, prettier product.

Just FYI, some upscale residents

in this very upscale building

where your upscale
store actually is located

recently told us they were fabulous.

I understand.

But they're not pretty enough.

Listen, battlefield earth.

This is Williamsburg, Brooklyn,

and no amount of exposed brick and paint

can change the fact that,
right where you're standing,

I've seen Tommy O'Hanlon's wing-wang

more times than I care to remember.

And I must say, it was way less
offensive than your attitude.

And you can shove that up your upscale.

Let's go.

- Namaste.
- Namaste.

What's with the empty hands, Max?

No cupcakes tonight?

No, they're bugging me. I
decided to take the night off.

Be careful with decisions like that.

In 1987, I took a night off
from earth, wind, and fire

and the next day, they
earth, wind, and fired my ass.

Hi. Sorry I'm late.

Mid-afternoon nap in your vagina?

I wish! No.

I went to a cheap bakery
supply store in Greenpoint

and got us some supplies.

Here.

It's the basic cake decorating kit.

And best of all I found us a fun,

reasonable two-session
cupcake decorating class

at a bakery.

We can learn how to make pretty roses.

No way.

The cupcakes don't need to be pretty.

They compensate by having
a great sense of humor.

Pretty cupcakes is just
another option for our business.

People want pretty, we do pretty.

Or people want
homemade, we do--

- Wait, where is our homemade?
- I didn't make any tonight.

You didn't make any?

What, you get one piece
of constructive criticism

and you stop making them?

Max, it's business.

And maybe Semhar has a point
about making them pretty.

First of all, what does
she know about pretty?

The woman has dreadlocks.

Her head looks like the stuff

you empty out of a vacuum cleaner bag.

Not pretty.

Forget her.

What's happening with you?

What's your problem with pretty?

Don't wave your
divas live hand at me.

I just think society's way too concerned

with other people's
idea of what's pretty.

You don't think you can do it.

That's what this is about.

This isn't about society.

You're afraid you can't do pretty.

Look, I don't do pretty

the way you don't do Puerto Ricans.

What are you talking about?

I'll do Puerto Ricans.

All right.

Then go do one and leave me alone.

Max, it's a skill. That's all.

It's not shameful to not
know how to do something.

Didn't you have piano
lessons growing up?

Seriously?

Ice skating?

Closest I've come to blades on ice

was when a pregnant
girl pulled a knife on me

at a hockey game.

Look, you and I have a business,

and this is a skill we need.

We're going to that class

and we are gonna master
how to make pretty roses.

And I know how much you
hate anything trendy,

so I found us a family-owned
Italian bakery in Brooklyn.

Italian's good.

Maybe they'll know how to dump the body

after I kill you.

First of all, welcome
to Spice and Sugar.

We did a little twist on the
traditional sugar and spice

putting spice first because...

We're Italian.

And we always got the spice up front

and a little in the rear.

Holla!

Now are you embarrassed
you ever said holla?

My name is Stephanie, and
this is my cousin Serena,

and this bakery has been
in our family for years

and then we took it over and made it...

Hot.

All right, let's go around
and introduce ourselves

and tell us why you came tonight.

Let's start with the cute guys.

Always!

I'm Steve, I thought this would be

a fun idea for my bachelor party.

I'm getting married to
Michael...right there.

So cute. God bless!

And I'm Michael.

- I'm Michael as well.
- Michael.

Oh...So many Michaels.

- And you are?
- Michael.

No, I'm Max.

Oh, she's funny. So cute, God bless!

And I'm Caroline. I'm Max's partner.

- Oh, so many gays tonight.
- I know.

No, I'm her business partner.

We actually have our own cupcake
business over in Williamsburg,

and I must say, we're doing very well.

Max is the baker and
I'm the business head

and we're here tonight to
increase our skill level

and take our business
up to a level that's...

Hot as well.

If you're gonna talk that much,

no one will have time to learn anything.

I know, right?

So, uh, where's your shop?

Well, right now, we're just
working out of our apartment.

- So no shop.
- Oh, that's sweet.

- Cute.
- Yeah, good luck, God bless.

Can you say jealous?

All right, let's start simple

with a pretty little icing flower.

Everybody pick up your piping bags,

and with a
straight-edge tip--

But you guys can use your gay-edge tip.

All right, everybody watch Stephanie.

You're gonna take the nail head

and you're gonna make a little "U"

so that you get little petals.

And we'll do this five times.

And then, you have a pretty
little five-petal flower.

- Simple.
- So cute. How fun!

No, no. You gotta
start by making a "U".

I did. That's a "U".

- Serena, is that a "U"?
- Not a "U".

Fine, I'll start over.

That was a "U".

And what, just because I
don't have a quote-unquote shop

I don't know a "U"?

What's with the attitude?

All right, let's leave.

Next time the gays giggle,
we'll just slide out.

No, we're here to learn.

That looks good.

I suck. I'm starting over.

Max, why'd you do that? It was good.

Not good enough.

You two not done yet?

You have to master the little flower,

or when we move on to
roses you'll be screwed.

- Right, cuz?
- Oh, totally screwed.

Screwed and not in the good way.

Do you think we can convince them

that slapping each other's
face is the new high five?

Steve, oh, my God.
That rose is gorgeous.

Good for you.

All right, one more minute
and we'll display our roses.

Psst. Steve. Little help.

I choke at timed tests. I
got like a 40 on my SATs.

Damn it, Steve!

Look at this place.

There's no way these girls

could have this much cupcake
success in this economy.

I mean, the overhead
on this building alone--

What are you saying?

Not saying mob money,

just saying maybe we'd have a shop too

- if we had mob money.
- Shh.

Keep it down.

You wanna wake up tomorrow
with Chestnut's head

in your vagina bed?

Okay, time's up.
Let's see what you got.

What is that? There's
like nothing there.

That's not a rose.

- It's minimalist.
- Whatev.

No, not "whatev". It's brilliant.

And I would know because,
when I was in Tokyo,

I had a private Japanese
flower arranging class

with the head of the Ikebana institute.

And he said I had a gift.

In his words,
"Caroline..."

Whatev. Okay, what
about your friend there?

I kinda ran out of time.

You had 20 minutes.

I thought she said you were the baker.

No, you need to be able to whip
these out in like 20 seconds

if you wanna be successful
in your little bakery.

"Um, I'd like a cupcake."
"That'll be 12 hours."

- Right?
- Right.

And they have to be prettier than that.

Well, maybe you'll
do better tomorrow.

Remember. Your homework assignment

is to bring in a cupcake
with a pretty rose on it.

Right.

Like we're gonna come back here

and spend time with
these Robert de Nir-hos.

Ugh! That one stinks too. Damn it!

Max, forget it.

It's 3:00 A.M.
Go to bed.

Don't. Don't say anything to me.

I am so mad at you right now.

- What did I do?
- Everything.

I used to love making cupcakes.

It was the one thing
I could zone out and do

without thinking.

And now all I'm doing is thinking.

Thinking that I stink
at making cupcakes.

Well, stop it.

Who cares what they think?
They're bitchy baking bullies.

We don't have to go back there.

Oh, and then what?

I'm gonna think my
cupcakes weren't good enough

for the rest of my life?

You said we need the skill,
then we need the skill.

I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a quitter.

I'm gonna make a stupid,
pretty cupcake if it kills me.

Or you.

And you are going back there with me.

And we're gonna shove our pretty cupcake

right up Snooki and her cousin's asses.

Now, shut up, don't talk to me,

and go back in your vagina.

Sorry you had to see that, Chestnut.

Oh, not very pretty.

But at least you tried, Michael.

Just one question.

Are you sure that you're gay?

Oh, okay, Caroline.
Let's see your pretty rose.

I didn't do one.

Society is way too concerned
with other people's idea

of what's pretty.

Whatevs.

Okay, what about your baker there?

She bail too?

No, here it is.

- Mm-hmm.
- Max, that's so pretty.

I'm so proud of you.

Good work, God bless. Good for you.

How long did it take you?

About three hours and 40 minutes.

But I did it!

I just wanted to prove to you and myself

I can make something pretty.

And now
that I have--

Mm!

That cupcake wasn't
me. I don't do pretty.

But I did make each of you
a cupcake that I think says

what I feel about this
whole cupcake class.

This one says "Bite me".

This one says "Screw U".

You see that "U"? That's a "U".

Holla!

Well, good luck with that.

People don't want
cupcakes that insult them.

Oh, my God, Max. That's our thing.

I was wrong. You were right.

We don't need to make pretty cupcakes.

Everybody does pretty.

We have to do what you do best.

Insult people.

Yeah, who's gonna buy that?

We will. For our shower.

And really let us bitches have it!

Move over! I wanna sit here close to you
so we can take the picture for our new website.

Look, if you want to get all
lesbian with me, just go for it.

You don't have to pretend
it's for the website.

It is.

And for the record, in 2009,
when Katy Perry

"kissed a girl and liked it,"
I kissed one and didn't.

Ready?

One... two... and...

- Perfect.
- Perfect?

This photo does not say "let us
do your child's birthday party."

It says
"we're an AC/DC tribute band,

and you can pay us in cocaine."

Oleg,

will you take a picture
of us for our website?

You realize
you just asked a man

who only takes pictures
of his penis?

Yes.

But it's always well-lit,
and perfectly in focus.

You won't be disappointed.

I take lots of website pictures.

Yeah, but we're not wearing
just bras and chicken masks.

We have time.

Maybe we should rethink
the "coke whore" picture.

Well, good night, ladies.

Sleep tight,
don't let the bed bugs bite.

And I remember
a time in New York

when that was more
cute than accurate.

- Good night, Earl.
- Good night.

Earl, I have come across

a $6 inaccuracy
in tonight's total.

You must go over
all checks again.

Han, I'm just on my way home.

But it is not yet 2:00 A.M.

I hate to play the heavy,

but you must sit down
and go over checks again.

Han, I am 75 years old.

I don't even have enough
time left to wipe twice.

Well, well.

Hello there.

Oh, there are the girls.

Sophie, hello.

You look pretty.

Oh, I know.

Oh, sorry,
the kitchen's closed.

- What?
- Kitchen was closed...

But can now be open again

for such a beautiful woman.

Hello. I am the chef.

Oh, here we go.

Ukraine's going
to try to invade Poland.

It's double d-day.

Oleg, this is
our neighbor, Sophie.

I would like to have
a plate with sausage on it

while I look over the menu.

Yowza.

You are like someone super-sized
Victoria's secret angel.

I'd like to Gisele
on your Bundchens.

You're going
to act like a dog,

I'll treat you like a dog.

Well, there goes
his photography career.

Do you still want the sausage?

Yes, of course.
Why should sausage suffer?

You know
how to handle yourself.

- Impressive.
- Mm-hmm.

That was like a game
of "rock, paper, pervert."

Sophie, thank you
for coming in.

Max and I wanted to talk
to you about taking you up

on your offer to work
for your cleaning company.

Yeah, she wants to do it for
money to pay for our website,

and I want to do it

because I like rummaging through
strangers' medicine cabinets.

Have you cleaned
houses before?

Well, I had a house,
and it was very clean.

But whatever the task,
you won't be sorry.

Max and I are a great team,

and when we set our mind to
something, we accomplish it.

- And if you consider giving us...
- Oh, stop.

This is not
a dental school interview.

Come on,
this is scrubbing toilets.

In or out?

We're in.
All the way.

In my experience,
when someone has to tell you

they're all the way in,

you'd better hope
their tongue works.

So dirty.

We can start tomorrow.

Just tell us where to go,
and we'll be there.

Oh, okay.

Well, uh, you walk
out your door,

you take right,
you go upstairs,

you open my door,
and you clean my apartment.

Is audition.

Can't I just take off
my shirt like in fame?

Excuse me.

Here is your
non-sexual appetizer.

You and I will start small.

You like?

Yes.

Good boy. Now go.

Forced to clean
Sophie's apartment?

This is getting dicey.

Next thing you know,
we're locked in a crate

on our way to the far east.

Max, we're going to spend
this money on our website.

That's the future
of our company.

But the future
is so far in the future,

and I need this money
now for real stuff,

like gummi bears and eye liner.

How do you think
you get to the future?

Uh, Marty McFly
and a delorean?

Besides, we don't need
the website yet.

We got the birthday cupcake
job tomorrow without it.

And where do you think
we got that job?

I don't know, the job fairy?

What? I don't pay attention
to the business stuff.

I got the order
at the web design company

when I overheard someone say
it was his son's fifth birthday.

Gross. Using children
for your own profit.

Way to go, China.

Well, here we are.

Why is this big news?

Come in.

So, if this all works out today,

I have two possible
jobs for you.

Two? That's amazing.

This is the only way
that I can make sure

that you don't ruin
my company's good name.

'Cause I work hard
to build "Sophie's choice."

Now, uh, one
of you take bathroom

and one of you take out here.

Who does which?

Bathroom. I'm going
to go with bathroom.

I love a challenge.

If not perfect clean,
no job.

Begin.

Watch out, ladies.

I'm about to go ham
on this b-room.

What is this "ham"?

Hard as a mother.

Max, I love when you're dirty.

Oh. Very impressive.

You clean

like bull.

Roar of cleaning.

No big deal.

I was lifting up couches
when I was six

to help my mom look for change
and her boyfriend's tooth.

I'm almost finished in here!

This one like
to make big announcements

- about nothing, yes?
- Yes.

Hey, does that
electric cigarette work?

Yes, yeah.

I smoked for seven years,
and then I quit when I was 12.

Yeah, I didn't want to die
of lung cancer

before I was teenager.

Can I get a hit?

Oh, yeah, please, try.

I have many more in the drawers.

I smoked the summer I shucked
oysters on a gay cruise.

Ooh, glamorous.

Almost done.
Two-minute warning.

Be prepared to be amazed.

Max, you shouldn't smoke.
You'll get...

What, electrocuted?

This is silly.

If I'm going to suck
on something this hard

and get no pleasure out of it,
I should just date.

I think you're going
to be thrilled.

Oh, she stinks.

Spritz, spritz.
She is sprayer.

All mirror, no toilet.

Well, you know, she's sort of
new to this kind of work.

She was born rich,

but her father stole
a bunch of money from people,

and she was thrown out
of her townhouse and disgraced.

Yes, well,
she clean like rich girl.

"Hey, everybody, look,
look what I'm doing.

Oh, spritz, spritz."

Oh!

See, you not born rich,

and you... you're like "roar."

- Right?
- Well.

Cleaning's not her thing,
but she has other strengths.

Mm, I don't see them.

Mm.

Uh, so
do we not have the job?

No, I give you job,

because one bull
equal two girls.

But why you need her,
I don't know.

You can make much more money
on your own.

Yeah, well,
we're kind of a team.

Listen, Max.
Let me tell you something.

She is like rock,
tied to you, balloon.

See, she hold you down.

You cut her loose, and...

Yeah, well,
she's not weighing me down.

I had lover who was rock.

And I let him go, and...

I'm finished, and I have
to say, that bathroom?

Nailed it.

Don't push it.
She saw it.

She barely looked at it.
I saw you in the mirror.

Your eye never even looked down.

Yes, that's because
this eye doesn't go down.

See, I'm trying.

Yeah, I have blind spot
from accident as child.

When I was six years old,

while working in Polish
knock-off

of McDonalds in warsaw,

I fell on hot McStick.

How did you fall
on a hot stick?

Not a stick that is hot.
A hot McStick.

It's meat on a stick,
and it's very popular.

They only have it, like,
two times a year.

It's like Mcribs.

Sophie, I'm so sorry,
that's awful.

Yeah, but I bet that
McStick thing is delicious.

It is.

Well, that must
have been hard.

I admire your courage.

What are you,
counsellor from unicef?

You are acing this interview.

Pffft...

Do you know where we are?

This whole building is models.

Life is so funny.

When I lived in Manhattan,

I used to come to model parties
here all the time.

And now you clean up
their poop.

You're right.
Life is funny.

Here's the apartment
upstairs tomorrow.

- 10j. Here it is.
- How do I look?

Maybe he's the Abercrombie model
from the Christmas ad

in the white sleigh

with the open fleece jacket
and the eight-pack.

I don't think it's him.

Hi, I'm big bill.

Come on in, girlies.

How many packs did you say?

Oh, what a lovely... oh!

Oh, my God.

Look, Max, he's a figure skater.

Go ahead, take it all in.

How could you not?

It's okay, I'm a model.
I'm used to it.

Hey, I know you.
You're the big bill.

You're the guy from
the gag greeting cards.

Yep. I sold 2 million
of that particular card.

On the front it says,
"you're on,"

when you open it up...

- "Thin ice"!
- Right.

Oh, I've got to go
in my bedroom and change.

I'll be right back.

Wow, big bill!

No, big bye-bye.

We're not staying here.

If that's what's on the wall,

who knows what's on the floor.

Or trapped underneath it.

This is an uncomfortable
work environment.

You were going to be on
all fours scrubbing a toilet.

It was always going to be an
uncomfortable work environment.

Okay, if we're staying,
that's three times

the amount of man.
We should get double the money.

I'm calling Sophie right now

and telling her
we should get more.

Um, I would not suggest
you complain to Sophie.

It's not a good idea.

Why? Do you know
something I don't?

She thinks you don't
know how to clean,

that you spritz, spritz.

And what does she say
about your cleaning skills?

I'm a bull and I roar.

I knew she didn't like me.

She only has eye for you.

Who cares what she thinks.
Just clean better today.

You do the living room.
I'll do the bathroom.

No, I'll do the bathroom,
just to prove a point.

I mean, reprove it.

This is just like when

they made me take
the S.A.T.S again,

away from all the asian kids.

Oh! Oh, my God!

Why are you freaking out?

You've already seen him naked.

It's not him.

Have you seen the size
of this toilet?

That is a big-ass toilet.

Literally.

Max, I'm finished.

The floor is so clean
you could eat off it,

and I'm sure he will.

Come on in,
I want you to see it.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Go down, go down, stop.
Never mind!

Don't need you to see it.
Everything's okay.

How's it going out there?

Either your water just broke,
or you pee like a smurf.

My shoes.

No, you did not flush
a whole roll of paper towels.

No, you did not
just use that tone with me

when my good shoes are wet.

Shut off the valve.

The valve?

Oh, God,
what is wrong with you?

How can you not know where
a toilet valve is?

I was rich.

But you have to admit,
the mirror?

Nailed it.

Wake up, you lazy bitch!

- What?
- Fire!

I'm fired?
Why, because of the toilet?

Look at the oven,
the cupcakes.

I'm sorry.
I fell asleep.

I was just going to lay down
for five minutes.

I asked you to do
one thing

while I went out
to get more milk...

Take the cupcakes
out of the oven.

"Happy Birthday, kids.
From Max's homemade cupcakes.

"You can learn more about us
and our blackened cupcakes

on our expensive website."

I'm sorry, Max.

I just really needed a little
siesta after all that cleaning.

How are you so good at Spanish
and so bad at cleaning?

What is that smell?

I grabbed my purse and ran.

Caroline burned cupcakes.

Oh, so sad.

Look at all those burnt cakes.

What happened here?

Just a little mishap.

I was so tired from cleaning
that bathroom earlier,

that I laid my head down
for five minutes

- and ended up falling asleep.
- Aw...

Such a shame.

Oh, look Max.

These cupcakes,
they're hard as rocks.

All you have to do

is throw the rock away,
and whee!

I don't think Sophie likes me.

What are you talking about?
She loves you.

No. I don't think
she has a blind spot.

I think she has
a blonde spot... for me.

Well, I think we've
found the place

where red bulls come to die.

Man, why do I never get
invited to parties like this?

Look. Do you know
what that means?

Yeah, this building
has a real shirt shortage.

Oh, my God,
do you think

this might be the Abercrombie
model's apartment?

I doubt it's the Abercrombie
model's apartment.

Here's a note.

It's addressed
to "cleaning dood,"

"dude" spelled "d-o-o-d."

It definitely might be the
Abercrombie model's apartment.

"Wake me when you get here."
He wants us to wake him.

So, do you think
he sleeps in the nude?

Yeah, "nood", "n-o-o-d."

Come on, let's go look.

Oh, oh, oh, so what,
seeing this guy naked

is no longer an "uncomfortable
work environment"?

It's still uncomfortable,

but in that exciting
uncomfortable way.

I think it is him.

It's the guy who put
the "abs" in Abercrombie.

And he's naked.
The good naked.

Should we lift the sheet?

Why not? I already
lifted it in my mind.

Max, I got this.

You start cleaning up
the mess out there.

No, you start cleaning
the mess out there... I got this.

The bedroom's attached
to the bathroom,

and I always do the bathrooms,
and he's my ideal type.

And by "doing" the bathrooms
do you mean flooding them,

and by "ideal type,"
do you mean unconscious?

Shh! We can talk
about this out here.

You're going to wake him.

That's what we're
supposed to do.

But as usual,
you don't want to do the job.

What's wrong with you?
You're acting weird.

Well, why should I have
to do all the heavy lifting

while you just get to nap
and see free model penis?

All the heavy lifting?
Where'd you get that from?

No one.

Sophie.

I knew she didn't like me.

It's not that
she doesn't like you,

she just doesn't think you're...

What? Doing anything?

She thinks
I'm not pulling my weight?

She thinks I'm dead weight?

Not dead weight,
more like... a rock...

To my balloon.

What is that,
some kind of Polish haiku?

What does that even mean?

She thinks if I cut the rock
loose, I'll go... fuuuuu!

Wait, so you're siding with

a woman you met
a week ago over me?

I'm not siding with anyone.
I'm just saying...

I know what this is.
This is "pick on the rich girl."

It's a poverty smackdown.

I heard you two talking
while I was in her bathroom,

spritz spritzing.

You think you do everything?
Fine, do everything.

You can "balloon"
all over this place,

'cause the "rock" is leaving.

Who is it?

You're the rock!
I'm the balloon!

Without me lifting you out of
your negative rockness,

you wouldn't even have
a cupcake business.

I'm the reason we even
have cupcake jobs.

Oh, oh, you're the reason?

Who stayed up all last night
baking 24 more cupcakes

while you were sleeping?

You did. And who delivered
the cupcakes this morning

while you were sleeping?
I did. Me. The balloon.

I floated over there and got
paid for the job that I got us

from the website
that I'm trying to pay for.

And now, I'm going
to float down this hall

and wake the hot model up
'cause, contrary to what you

and your poverty gal-pal
might think,

I always do the job
I'm hired for.

Oh, no! I am going
to wake him up.

Free model penis is my reward
for doing everything

and being tied
to a rock like you.

Oh, see? I can't get away,
because you're the rock

and you're heavier
than my balloon.

Hey, stop!

This is cleaning job,

not gorgeous ladies
of wrestling.

Good thing I stopped by
to check on you.

- What is all this?
- You explain it.

I'm going
to go wake the hot model up.

He left a note.
Just doing my job.

As usual.

So, you think
I'm holding Max back?

What kind of question is this?

Yes.

Well, you're wrong.
We're a great team.

And, yes, there are some
things she's better at.

But there are other areas
where I excel.

Well, I don't see them.

That's probably
because of your eye.

Did you wake him up?

Uh, no.
I think he might be dead.

Oh, no, not the hot one!

Aw, he's my favorite.

This is all I need on yelp.

We should call 911.

No, I got it.

What are you going to do?

I'm going to give him
mouth-to-mouth.

I didn't know there was
so much tongue involved.

This is not working.

But, you know what?
I know he's still alive,

because his manhood
is knocking on my lady door.

He must have taken too many
of those pills on the table.

Pills? I got this.

Max, go get some
hydrogen peroxide.

- Sophie, step aside, now.
- Oh, all right.

You sure you know
what you're doing?

My friend Candace travelstead
od'd like three times

in college,
and I brought her back twice.

There you go.

Bring him up.

Max, you hold his head back,
open his mouth.

Back up.

I'm starting
to see your worth.

What? You're being
subway creepy.

I have to say,
when you were punching

that almost-dead guy
in the stomach,

that was a serious
balloon move.

The truth is,
we're both balloons.

Yeah, but mine is, like,
way cooler than yours.

It's like one of those silver
ones that never goes out of air.

They don't make those anymore.
They're toxic.

Exactly.

Max, you know you won't
let me come into the kitchen

and help you bake, right?

And you know that
I know that without you,

the job fairy
would never show up, right?

But if you ever need me
to help you bake, I could.

No, it's cool.

You do your thing,
I'll do mine.

Hey, get your phone.

We should capture this
near-death victory moment

as our website picture.

Totally.

On the count of three,
think..."We made $200."

One... two...

Hold up.

Sir, if you want to go home
with that hand,

get it off my ass.

Okay, three.

The Sad Lady Book Club
is reading

Fifty Shades of Grey again.

There's not a dry seat
in the house.

If those ladies
are that into light torture,

they should just apply
for our jobs.

[bell dings]
- Hey.

Aww, you two are so adorable.

Like Romeo and Juliet,
but without the bright future.

Yeah...

I want him out of the diner.

What are you talking about?

Anyone who works
in this diner

is like a fat guy
in a smart car.

You can never get out.

It's true.

I came in here in 1962
for a cup of coffee.

Someone asked me to break
a dollar, and I never left.

Look. Living, working,
and sleeping with the same guy

is never a good idea.

Just talk to Hillary Clinton.

I guess I can get
a dishwasher fired.

When I was rich, I got Wolfgang
Puck fired from Wolfgang Puck.

Get yours, Max!

Hit it then quit it.

That strategy served me well
in my 20s and 30s.

Evening, ladies.

Also, my 70s.

(Peter Bjorn and John)

[bell dinging]
- Pick up.

Or don't.

Who gives a crap?

Well, someone's in a bad mood.
What's wrong, Oleg?

Did they discontinue
making Axe body spray?

Don't even kid.

No. I'm cranky because
I'm not having sex right now.

Yeah. I thought it was weird
seeing both your hands

while you were talking.

Sophie's idea.
It's some old Polish ritual.

The bride and groom
remain chaste for 30 days

before the wedding.

Apparently, the "something blue"
at the wedding

has got to be my balls.

So, you're practicing
celibacy.

I'm trying,
but there are women everywhere.

I feel like
a bull in a vagina shop.

Hear ye, hear ye!

I'm unveiling a major
improvement to the diner!

Well, we'll miss you, Han.

Nice try, Max,
but like Ryan Seacrest,

I'll be here forever.

Now, will you all please do what
you have yet to do on Twitter

and follow me?

You too, Earl.

Hell, this better be good.

Every step I take
could be my last.

And now...

Without further a-douche...

Ready to have your minds blown?

At this point, I'm ready
to have anything blown.

Ta-da!

That is the worst gift
I ever received

and last year,
my son bought me a coffin.

This works our great then,
because it's not for you.

It's for Nash.

Oh, well, that's real nice.

Because the shower at Max's
place doesn't work at all.

You better believe it's nice.

That's the Spritzy 5000.

Dishwasher Weekly gave it
four out of four Dishies.

You know our oven doesn't work,
right?

Hey, boss lady, if we work hard,
do we get a gift?

If you work hard,
I'll die childless

with my mouth frozen open
in shock.

Yeah, I went there!

Nash works hard, so only he may
handle my beautiful hose!

Well, if he's handling
Han's hose,

he's never getting fired.

Okay. Step up here, Nash.

I'll show you
what this puppy can do.

So far the puppy can't reach
the hose.

A little help.

Aww, there's nothing cuter
than a hot guy holding a baby.

Now just grab that thing
and squeeze it till it sprays.

Move to call a moratorium
on the words "grab," "squeeze,"

and "sprays" till the wedding.

Damn!
That's hot.

And me without any singles
to stuff down his pants.

Well, I better go dry off
in the men's room.

Don't be too long
in that stall.

I've got a date with the Land
O'Lakes butter package lady

on my next break.

[all gasping]

Oh. Pardon me, ladies.
I'm all wet.

[all gasping]

Max? Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

Those ladies looking at him
like he's a senior special

at Sizzler's?

[all speaking at once]

We might not be able
to get Nash fired,

but we can get him hired
as a fashion model.

Look at their faces.

He could be the future bulge
of Calvin Klein.

Now you're talking
about the future?

Why can't you just accept
that we are stuck

with a really crappy present?

Quit trash-talking
the Spritzy 5000!

Good afternoon.
Welcome to The High.

I'll have somebody
get you some water.

Not me,
'cause I'm past that.

You know, here.

I think I just sat another one
of those lesbian blind-dates

for our boss.

It's hard out there
for a pimp.

Why do you think
I got out of pimping?

That and someone broke
a beer bottle over my head.

So, did you get Nash a modeling
job yet?

I'm working on it.

It's not like I can
just call Tyra Banks.

Well, that's what her people
said when I called.

Ugh, phone therapy ran long.

Apparently I have more issues
than I realized

about Rosie leaving The View.

Are my dates here yet?

Please don't
tell me it's her, her, or her.

It's her, her, and her.

Lose them.

How am I supposed to
get rid of them?

Just say what anyone says when
they want a lesbian to leave,

"There's a Subaru outside
that's about to get a ticket."

If you had you told me,
ten years ago,

I'd be on a dating site
called "Lez Meet Up,"

I would've told the youth pastor
I was married to,

"You've lost your mind."

[phone beeps]

[gasps]

Oh, I just got some interest

from the
Del Monico Modeling Agency.

But for the interview,
he needs photos.

And not just the pictures
of his butt on your phone.

Fine, you handle it.

The only thing I know
about modeling is

a couple of years ago, I was
the face of shingles on WebMD.

Girls, perfect timing to ask me
to do this photo shoot.

The FBI just gave me
my camera back last week.

Oh, so you get your camera back,

but I'm still waiting
on that kilo of coke

that I spent hours carefully
filling my butt with?

Let me just change the settings.

This camera is used to taking
pictures from 800 feet away.

And we want those pictures back,
Oleg!

Hey, everybody!

Just call me
"rush hour traffic"

'cause I sure am horny.

Oh, Caroline, I do not know how
you go years, and years,

and years, and years,
and years, and years

without doing the nasty.

It's only been years and years.

- Come on.
- And years.

Well, I could go
for a brisket sandwich.

We're closed, Sophie.

I know.
I got one in my purse.

And why are you doing the photo
shoot in this skanky dishroom?

Because we're going with
the "hot dishwasher" angle.

The agency said
every model needs a hook.

Yeah, like how Cindy Crawford
has a beauty mark

and Anna Nicole Smith
is dead.

Yeah, yeah. My sister is a model
in Poland and she has a hook.

It's her left hand, yeah.
It's is also great for kabobs.

Come on, Nash!

Put a little Irish Spring
in your step.

I'm a little nervous.

The only other time I had
my picture taken was at school.

The priest said he needed a
shirtless one for the roll call.

Where did he go to school,
Our Lady of To Catch a Predator?

Wow. You sure look hot.

Careful, Sophie.

That's my brisket.

I'm not talking about
Daniel Day-Loser here.

I'm talking about Oleg.

You are sweating
like an old knockwurst

that has been left out
in the sun.

It's really breathtaking.

Okay, Nash, stand over here
near the hose

and give me hot face,
dead eyes.

You know, like me
when I mix NyQuil and DayQuil.

I call it
AfternoonQuil.

Okay. Now I'm gonna start
shooting.

Yeah. Shoot, baby!
Shoot!

- What do you think?
[camera clicking]

Well, he's stiff,
but not in the good way.

Ugh, this is painful.

He's like Susan Boyle
without the star quality.

We need a little of what
he had the other day.

You'll thank me for this later.

[camera clicking]

Yes, Nash, yes!

Tear your shirt!

- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

[gasps]

Stop!

What the hell is happening
in here?

I didn't give anyone permission
to use my diner

for a photo shoot.

Calm down.

We are trying to get him
a modeling job.

He has a job!
He's my number one worker.

Like the doctor said to your
mother when you were born,

tough break.

You two crows
don't let me have anything!

Okay, Nash,
part of the model audish

is to see how you'd be
as a performer in commercials,

and movies, and other things
people don't watch anymore.

Now, obviously,
right out of the gate,

you're not gonna be as good
as that duck who says "Aflac,"

but you've got to be at least
as good as Ben Affleck.

I can help. For a time,
I had a rich acting career.

It started with a starring role
in Annie,

and ended when I portrayed
Rosa Parks

in an ill-advised high school
production

that led to an investigation
by the NAACP.

Ooh, this is a commercial
for breakfast cereal!

Ah! Every actor's dream!

Hey, Nash, read this.

Think James Dean.

But alive
and eating Cocoa Puffs.

"Cocoa Puffs
are a delicious part

of any well-balanced breakfast."

I'm trying to find
a nice way to say--

You suck, bro.

You--you get it.

You know the thrill
of eating chocolate

at a traditionally
non-chocolatey time of day.

Let's tap into that.

Okay. Take it from the top.

And this time, go cuckoo.

Go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

"Cocoa Puffs are a delicious--"

Stop.

Don't phone this in.
It's not Raisin Bran.

"Pocoa Cuffs are a delicious--"

"Pocoa Cuffs"?

Pocoa Cuffs?

I just can't with these
rank amateurs, Caroline.

Max, calm down.

It's a fake tryout
for a cereal commercial,

not Dance Moms.

I'm nervous.
I'm not an actor.

Uh, no, you are not.

Give me that.

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

Got it.

Cocoa Puffs are a delicious part
of any well-balanced breakfast!

They're good for you,
which parents love,

and they taste like candy,
which I love!

I can't help it!
I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!

Cuckoo!

I'm tearing up, and it's not
just the black mold in here.

Max, I think you may have just
set the acting bar too high.

[knock at door]
- Oh.

I've never set a bar
too high before.

I've set a bar on fire
and I've left a bar too high.

Oh, hey, girls.

Oh, do you mind if I hang
down here with you for a while?

Oleg is up there,
he's trying to seduce me

by cleaning the apartment.

And it's, oh, oh, so dirty.

[vacuum cleaner humming]

Oh, oh, he's vacuuming now,
which means he's naked.

Oh, me and my Polish values.

Polish Values?

That's the name of my favorite
dollar store in Brooklyn.

[vacuum humming]

Oh, he's deep-cleaning the shag.

Oh, my God.
Somebody, do something

to make me not want sex.

All right, Nash, why don't you
show us your runway walk?

That was it.

Oh, I thought you were going
to pick up a pen.

Thanks, perfect.

Now I'm completely turned off.

Watching that potato walk across
the room really did the trick.

Nash, concentrate.

Follow my lead.

Bam. Pow. Bam. Pow.

And step and bam,
and step and pow,

and step and bam!

Oh, even better!

I mean, after that,
they could film the sequel

to Frozen on my lady parts.

Yeah, me too.

But just 'cause I
"Let It Go" down there.

[vacuum hum continues]
- Aaah!

Oh, now he's using
the wand attachment.

Oh, and he's getting real deep
between the cushions.

Oh, my God, just screw it.

I'm never gonna make it
to the wedding!

[groaning]

Oh, Grandma Kuchenski,
please forgive me

for what I'm about to do.

I--

Well, you were no White Lily
yourself!

[gasps]
- Wow.

He's bamming and powing
up a storm.

When he's famous,
I hope he remembers us.

Pfft. I like to think I did some
things he will never forget.

How's that?

Great, you can walk.

If you can read too, I'll treat
myself to a Snapple.

Let's get to the copy.

Actually, we came prepared.

Nash rehearsed
the Cocoa Puffs commercial.

I think you'll be quite moved.

Oh yeah, well,
we'll be reading something

a little different today.

[clears throat]

Don't panic.
They do this all the time.

They want to make sure
you're flexible.

Yeah. Go ahead, Nash.

Whatever cereal it is,
act like it's delicious.

Unless it's Rice Krispies.
A-boring!

Okay, here goes.

"You know you like it.

Bend over, bitch."

Uh, are we missing a page?

Cereals have changed
since I was a kid.

Should I read the part
where I notice

the teacher's not wearing
any panties?

Oh, my God.
This is porn!

No wonder all those people
out there were freaks.

No wonder I recognized
so many of them.

Don't act so surprised.

Everyone knows Cocoa Puffs
is code for porn.

Also, you sent us some pictures
taken by someone

very experienced in erotica.

We can't let him
do this.

I have a movie that starts
shooting tomorrow

that pays $1,000 a day.

Can we?

Maybe we can't.

It's the lead in Sorest Rump.

Maybe we can.

I think we need
a little sidebar, Delores.

- [clears throat]
- Should I come with you?

No, we're good.

I have a couple of questions
for the actor.

Can you swim,
and are you circumcised?

Max, this has gone too far.

I know, I was expecting you
to just crash with me

for a couple of days
and get your own place.

Are we really gonna
let Nash do porn

just so he doesn't work
at the diner?

Hey, ladies,
what's it gonna be?

I got other talent to see.

I got a guy named Lustin Beaver

taking the Amtrak
in from Philly.

Max, if you're really keen on me
being a porn actor,

I'll do it.

She says, tomorrow,
they start filming

The Grand Booty Fest Hotel.

And, they'll pay me more
for my accent.

Also, what does "gay for pay"
mean?

Ugh, I guess it means
we got to go.

Look at him, Max.

A cute guy, eaten up
and spat out by show business

like so many
Baldwin brothers before him.

Nash doesn't care
about modeling.

He's 21.
He doesn't care about anything.

His biggest concern
is playing with the XBox.

Mine and, also,
the popular video game system.

He cares about you.

He was willing to do
"gay for pay."

Did I hear Nash
is going "gay for pay"?

'Cause I've got $4
burning a hole in my pocket.

Oh, a customer.

Hi, welcome to The High.
Here for dessert?

Oh, thanks but I haven't
had cake since my Sweet 16,

and even then,
I made myself throw it up.

I'm meeting someone here
and my phone's about to die.

And if it dies, I will too.
Do you have an outlet?

Screaming in the shower
really works for me.

Like, right into the water.

Super cute.
But I do need a phone outlet.

I'll plug you in, honey,

and I'll take care of your
phone, too.

Girls, meet Marie.

Hi.
Seriously, down to 10%.

Oh, did you two meet
on "Lez Meet Up"?

No, honey, I've never been
on "Lez Meet Up."

Oh, you're thinking of me,
Caroline.

You know how much
I love lady tail.

This place is amazing.

Isn't it amazing?

I had the decorator redo it
nine times.

You can feel his anger
in the walls.

It's electric.

We're electric.
Who is this miracle?

That's Nash.
I found him in the Bowery

next to a pile
of burning trash.

Go say hi.

He's even creamier and more
delicious up close.

You're eating?
That is so punk rock.

Tell me everything right now.

Uh, well, I'm a dishwasher.

I'm from Ireland.

Oh, I was trying
to become a model

and I almost did porn
an hour ago.

That is the best story
I ever heard.

Tell it to me again standing up.

But this time, don't talk.

I see face, I see ass,
I see model.

Do you have a manager?

I guess that'd be Caroline,
the blonde one over there.

Blonde one, come over here and
talk to me about your client.

I am in love.
He's perfection.

Marie Prower,
Senior VP of Marketing.

Sweet, what company?

Guess.

Um, Tommy Hilfinger.

I work for Guess, darling.

No more words.
Listen.

He's amazing.

I would tweet about him
right now, but my phone is dead.

So bring him into my office
on Monday.

You heard her, Caroline.

Bring him into her office
tomorrow.

She's obsessed with me.

Max, I was right.
He is a model.

Get me a hot wife and a hotter
woman to cheat on her with,

'cause I'm a big-time
talent manager.

Congratulations, dude.

Well, I guess if this works out,
I'm gonna have to quit my job

at the diner.

Will you be mad at me?

I'll be really sad.

I'm gonna miss you a lot,
you know?

Not seeing you 24/7.

But I would hate myself
if I didn't let you

follow your dreams.

Even if it means you moving out
of the apartment, too.

Now go.

Here comes that tear again.

I'm all choked up.

Max, you would have made a great
Rosa Parks.

If you had been Black.

Which, I guess,
is what they insist on.

But you got him to move out.

You are good.

Yeah, well, I mean,
he's cute,

but I'm not all that cuckoo
for his Cocoa Puffs.

[cash register bell rings]

Who or what did you do
to get this $20 tip?

Because I wheeled a customer
home the other night,

and all I got was a 5.

And that was after we made out
and I gave him a bath.

The lady at that table
asked me what was special here,

And I said, "I used to be,"
and then I burst into tears.

I pull that out
whenever I need a manicure.

Well, it's that time of year again.

I'm so jealous.

I can't believe you only get
your period once a year.

It's tax season,
and my accountant said

I'm getting a refund.

He also complimented these moccasins,

which are also controversial
around here.

Well, they do have the word
"mock", "ass" and "sin."

This is why I never wear overalls,

'cause you two would be...

- Overall...
- Disgusted?

Precisely.

Oh, Earl, that reminds me.

I forgot. Here you go.
I finished your taxes.

And for the future you cannot claim
your weed dealer as a dependent.

I don't know why.
I'm very dependent on weed.

Max, since I've been helping
everyone with their taxes,

Mostly because the only
other time I get to use

my financial degree is counting
how many Q-Tips we have left,

Five.

Three.
I dropped two in the toilet,

and the cockroacis using them
as oars for his boat.

Ha. That'll be cute.

Look, there are two things
I won't talk about.

Taxes or your flying dreams.

Face it, Caroline.
You're not going anywhere.

Okay, well, we have
to talk about our taxes,

and what we're gonna claim, and, no,
you cannot claim I'm ruining your life.

Why? I did that last year
and got $10 back.

Synced and corrected by backinblack


2:00 A.M., closing time. Let's go.

It's only 12:30.

- Nice try, Max.
- Come on, let's leave early.

I'm more exhausted than my bra.

Whoa, good, you're still open.

My fiancee wants a cupcake, and
she always gets what she wants.

Hi.

I mean, I really want
a house in the Hamptons,

but I'll take a cupcake.

I'm nothing like that sounded.

Don't apologize.

I'm everything like that sounded.

Oh, I'll be right back, babe.

There's a homeless guy building
a shopping bag house around the Porsche.

Too bad. That homeless guy
almost had a front Porsche.

He hates this neighborhood.

So you've been held up
at gunpoint one or two times?

It's like, grow a pair, right?

So what are you eating?

Um, chocolate.

But, wait, now I'm thinking
red velvet.

Tim put my ring in one
when he proposed.

Oh, he proposed with one
of our cupcakes?

That's so sweet.

Yeah, it was.

I mean, it was like a whole thing,
because I swallowed it,

but, once it passed,
really so pretty.

I gave him a 20 to move
to that Mini Cooper instead of our car.

Remind me to start calling Han
"Mini Cooper."

Babe, I've been thinking.

Uh-oh.
That's never good.

No, it's great, babe.
Listen.

So, since you proposed to me
with one of their cupcakes,

I was thinking that these girls
should do our wedding cake.

But, babe, we already ordered
a wedding cake.

$1,300.
Remember, babe?

I know, but, babe.

They said babe less
in the movie Babe.

So do you guys do wedding cakes?

- No.
- Yes.

I don't. She does.

She's the baker, and, yes,
we do tons of wedding cakes.

Gay weddings, straight weddings.

Bed wettings.

Claire, you do whatever you want,
but I'm gonna wait in the car.

I just can't do the cake stuff
again, babe.

He doesn't want to do the cake stuff.

Well, I don't want
to do the butt stuff.

You know what I mean?

- No.
- Yes.

Why don't you come in
and we can talk about it?

Enter through the diner.

Okay.
See you guys in a sec.

What is wrong with you?

I told you I didn't want
any more white girls in the shop.

And since when do we do
wedding cakes?

Since that guy said $1,300.

You can do this, Max.
You went to pastry school.

I also went to high school,

but I can't tell you
which president Rock Hudson was.

I don't do wedding cakes.

Okay, I know this may not be

the best time for you to make
your first wedding cake

because of your recent breakup.

Oh, it's not about Deke.

If you remember, I'm the one
who sent his 'fro out the door.

Weddings are just stupid.

This whole idea of celebrating love?

I mean, love works out less
than Chris Christie.

Right through here.

There you go, miss.

Thanks.

Did you want something else?

I'll take whatever I can get.

Okay, we're done.

You're lucky.
This morning, a cannoli shell

pressed sexual harassment
charges against him.

Oh, my God, you guys.

Your shop is so adorbs.

I'm Claire, by the way.

I owned a store on Bedford Ave.

A dress shop
called "Get the Frock Out."

Oh, I remember that place.

Wasn't it right next
to the hair salon, "Unbeweavable"?

Yeah, yeah,
between "Unbeweavable"

and the kosher smoothie place
called "The Wandering Juice."

I love their menorah-nge juice.

Yeah, you know, it was always
my dream to have a dress shop.

But then after a year
hardly anyone was coming in,

and I was like, maybe
I should get the frock out.

- So I bailed.
- I totally get it.

Our first shop failed,
but we got up, dusted ourselves off...

Well, Max went on a four-day bender,

I found her and dusted her off,
then we started again.

Yeah, good thing you downloaded
the "Find Your Drunk Roommate" app.

Oh, so you guys kept going,
even though you failed?

Why?
Don't you have boyfriends?

So when are you two getting married?

Oh, in three days.

Three days?
You're so calm.

Yeah, well, I was in the plane
that crashed in the Hudson,

so after that everything's
just kind of been "meh."

So do you know what kind
of cake you want?

Absolutely.
Something traditional,

something very old school,
you know, very romantic,

but, wait, now I'm thinking

You guys are so cool,

what if we did something with a
weird hipster Williamsburg vibe?

So you want an obnoxious cake

on a trust fund wearing
an ironic t-shirt with HPV?

But, wait, now I'm thinking
pastels for spring.

Oh, but, wait, now I'm thinking,
colors. I love clowns.

Wow, she changes her mind more
than I change my underwear.

So twice?

Sophie, on your tax form here,

you listed your occupation
as "Sophie."

Yeah, it's a full-time job, baby.

And who claims
$5,000 worth of mascara?

It's a business deduction
for my cleaning business.

I give it out to all the underage girls
from Poland as treats.

Just because you're scrubbing toilets
doesn't mean your eyes can't pop.

Do you have any legitimate
anything that we can use for anything?

Here's a big receipt.

$2,500 for Stolichnaya.

You can't write off liquor.

No, Irina Stolichnaya.

Yeah, she waxes my eyebrows.

And my downstairs eyebrows.

Okay, well, there's no line
on this form

for downstairs eyebrows,
so I'm just gonna list it as home office.

Yeah, well, I do work out of it.

Caroline, where's Max?

As much as I enjoy a two-hour break
from being called a tiny woman,

she's supposed to be working.

Max, how's the cake going?

That bride's a mess.

She changed her mind
while she was changing her mind.

Not the good stuff on the top shelf!

Oh, you can't reach it
anyway, Mini Cooper.

Joke's on her.
I have a collapsible ladder.

Oh, hi, Claire.
Max is working on it right now.

Oh, you've been thinking?

Caroline, can I get anything
for a panty liner?

I'm on the phone with Claire.

You mean un-Claire?

She wants to make a couple changes.

- What should I tell her?
- Tell her I hate her.

No, you know what, I'll tell her.

I love to tell people things.
Give me the phone.

Max, I beg you. $1,300.

Oh, my God. She is so crazy.

I should just make a giant cake
and have a psychiatrist pop out of it.

Give me the phone.

Hey, Claire, babe.
What's happening, babe?

Max, I've been thinking,

and I know I said I didn't want
the fondant frosting,

but now I just saw a photo
of another wedding cake that was so gorge.

And I started thinking...

Uh-huh. Sure.
No problem.

So then we can do the fondant?

Yes, definitely fondant.

Perfect. Bye. Love you.

Love you too.

Max, I know you worked hard,

and you're probably upset
about having to change it.

I'm sensing a lot of hostility

that has nothing to do
with that couple

and may be more about you

and a certain groom
that didn't happen.

What, you can't light
a couple's head on fire

without it being
about your ex-boyfriend?

Max, I know you're sad about it.

I heard you crying last night.

That was you crying.

Well, someone was crying.

Oh, my God.

Max. It's beautiful.

You did an amazing job.

That's quite a cake cake cake.

Calm down. I made a cake.
I didn't fold a fitted sheet.

Ooh, and I like
the new bride and groom.

By the way, I fished the other
ones out of the garbage

In case we ever get
a burn victim wedding.

Okay, I got the extra icing.
Let's go.

Now grab it with two hands
and lift with your knees.

Oh, is that how you think
it should go?

'cause I was gonna grab it with my head
and lift it with my face.

Got it. Got it. Got it.

Ooh.
Oh, wait.

Got it. Got it. Got it.

Got it. Got it. Got it.

- Grease puddle.
- Got it.

Got it. Got it.

- Roach.
- Got it.

Bedford Avenue.

Got it. Got it. Got it.

Got it. Got it.

Watch the doors.

Max, this is so heavy.

I know. We're two grown women
who can't afford a taxi.

Oh, there's a seat over there.
We can put this down.

Got it. Got it. Got it.

Oh! Oh!

I blame science.

People shouldn't be living this long.

Max, I need a break.

Me too.
Maybe just like two weeks apart.

Like, no phone calls, nothing.

I mean the cake.

And you love me.

Other side.
Less crowded.

Oh, this guy can't see.
Just our luck.

To the left, sir.

Other left!

Oh, what, is everybody blind now?

Who are you even dancing for?

Everyone's blind.

Got it. Got it.

Losing it.
Losing it.

Holding it. Holding it. Losing it.

Second wind.
Got it. Got it.

First avenue.
First avenue station.

There, there.
Put it down.

Max, I think we got it.

Don't got it.

Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.

Got it.

This cake looks perfect.
You would never know.

That's why I'm fond of the fondant.

Covers everything.
We'll be long gone by the time

they realize
it's half cake-half styrofoam

from the radio shack garbage.

Hi. I'm the wedding planner/
my own funeral planner

'cause it ain't going great.

You the cake girls?

You think
just 'cause we're two girls

With a giant cake
we're the cake girls?

You think 'cause I'm fake smiling
I won't throw you down a flight of stairs?

You do that?
Do you have a card?

Sorry. We d a rough morning
getting this here.

You?
She changed the menu again.

I spent the whole morning making
17 turkeys look

like 17 hams
for that crazy bitch.

Oh, come on, that's a little harsh.

What?
She won't come out of her room?

The bride has cold feet.

That crazy bitch.

Here's a crazy idea.

How about the check for the cake?

All right, I'm gonna tell
you two what I told

the make-your-own-popsicle guy.

Nobody gets paid until the bride
walks down the aisle.

Nobody.

There's gonna be popsicles?

She's not that crazy.

So what are we gonna do now?

- Let's go.
- Max, we can't go.

- We need this money.
- We also need a shower curtain

that doesn't give us rashes.

But, wait, we really need
this cake money.

We also really need a toilet
that flushes everything the first time.

While you were doing the cake,
I was doing our taxes.

And we owe Uncle Sam $1,500.

Man, why does every uncle
I know try to screw me?

So what are we gonna do?

You heard that woman.
Nobody gets paid

until the bride walks down the aisle.

Nobody.

Knock-knock.
There's the gorgeous bride.

Your dress is beautiful.

It's a beautiful dress to get married in
right now in the next room.

No, I hate it.
I'm taking it off.

I'm not wearing this dress
or that one or that one

because I'm thinking
marriage is stupid.

- So stupid.
- Max.

Stupid beautiful,
and everyone should do it.

Nope. It's not for me.

Like underwear.

Oh, you'll feel fine as soon as
you get back in this dress.

Or that dress or that dress.

Okay, I feel like you guys
are forcing me into this dress.

That's ridiculous.

Forcing you into a dress for money?

Now where's that freaking veil?

Nope, not that one.

This was just a backup veil.

You can't even see my face.

It was in case I got herpes.

You know how it is.

- Yeah.
- No.

Anyways, I'm thinking...

What, like seven different things
all resulting in us not getting paid?

Listen, I'm thinking that maybe
I bailed out of my shop too soon.

I mean, I left after only a year.

Why? 'Cause I was just scared?

Well, everybody's afraid of failure.

No, not failure.

There was a gang shooting
in front of my dress shop.

I had to bury two mannequins.

For future reference, just draw
a teardrop on your face,

and they'll move it
to Banana Republic.

Well, I mean, it wasn't easy
for you guys, right?

But you hung in there, and now you have
this big, successful cake business.

- We lied.
- It's terrible.

- We're losers.
- Get married.

Claire, the only thing harder
than building a business is finding love.

Look at her.
She just lost someone she loves,

and quite frankly she doesn't think
it's ever gonna happen for her again.

I mean, none of us do.

Not even Han?

No, he's the one who brought it up.

Claire, who knows you better than us?

You're getting married.

You're right.
I should get married.

Yay.

- But not to Tim.
- What?

You guys will tell him for me, right?

Tell him I'm no good.
Tell him I'm sorry.

You know what,
tell him whatever you want.

You guys decide.
I'm easy.

You know what she's not?
Easy.

You heard that woman.

Nobody gets paid
until the bride walks down the aisle.

Now, remember, don't lift this veil

until the party planner
hands me that check.

Why don't you have to wear the dress?

You're practically a virgin.

Max, somebody has to walk down
the aisle, and I can't do it.

Marriage means something to me,
and I only plan

to walk down that aisle once.

You also said that
about the yeast infection aisle

at CVS, but there you were
last Saturday

pretending to buy
children's cough syrup.

Let's go.

Now, walk down the aisle
like it's your special day.

Go. The bride never talks
to the cake lady.

People are like, "Who's that?"

If you think they're like,
"Who's that?" now,

wait a few minutes
till that veil gets lifted.

Can't believe it. She's actually
walking down that aisle.

Yup, that's totally her
walking down the aisle.

So the check,
you can hand it to me now.

You look stunning, babe.

Come on, come on, come on.
I'll just take

Whatever check's on top.

Babe, wait.

Now I'm thinking
I do want to get married.

Babe, if you're there, who is...

'Sup?

Babe, I know I said
I didn't want any kids,

but now I'm thinking four.

Babe, you should have said that
before the vasectomy.

You can always reverse it.

Again.

So you're the father, huh?

And you stuck around.

That's an interesting way to play it.

Okay, I got the check.
We can leave.

Not now. I'm doing
the father-daughter dance.

May I cut in?

Oh, no, with her.

If you're trying to hook up
with me, you're a little late.

That dad just slipped me his room key.

You really do make a lovely bride.

Oh, thanks. You know
I have one of those

ham turkeys in my underwear, right?

Oh, I thought you were
just happy to see me.

This is nice.

And that cake really is beautiful.

Thanks.

Wish I could have showed it to...

Deke.

Yeah.

So are you really okay?

I know you loved him.

I did, which is the worst, because
it made me feel almost like a person.

Max, Caroline, hi.

I just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

And I was watching you guys
dance together,

and now I'm thinking
I might be into girls.

Can I call you?

- Yes.
- No.

Great.

What do you mean the bottom
of the cake says radio shack?

That's our cue.

Wait, wait, I haven't thrown
the bouquet yet.

Hey, single ladies.

Here we go.

One, two...

Three.

Hey, cake girls.

Styrofoam?

It's gluten-free.

Synced and corrected by backinblack


So that's three of our
delicious homemade cupcakes.

Nope, can't.
You touched them.

Sorry, flu season, no health care.

You realized I replaced that
Purell with K.Y., right?

Max, please say you're kidding.

Of course, I'm kidding.

I can't afford lube.
I just use my tears.

Max, seriously, don't mess
with my hand sanitizer.

I've already caught poverty this year

and I refuse to catch the flu.

I just have to keep cleaning my
hands and not touch anyone.

Caroline, I have check from table ten.

Okay, just place it right there.

That's a big tip, wow--

You know, in Indonesia,
you'd be married now.

I'm gonna get sick, I know it.

You're fine.

Fine? Han just unloaded into my mouth.

Congratulations, you both
finally got some action.

I can't afford to
get sick and miss work.

I need to get some antibiotics.

You are poor now.

Poor people don't just run out
and buy antibiotics.

We man up, grow a pair,
stare germs in the face.

Like this French fry from that
guy who couldn't stop coughing.

Max, no, no--oh!

Mmm.

Booyah!

And I haven't ever been sick
or to a clinic.

And, no, planned parenthood
doesn't count.

Well, well, well, she weebles
and she wobbles,

but she don't fall down.

Oh, Earl, you're so naughty and nice.

And I'll be checking you out twice.

Hey, Sophie, sit anywhere you like.

Oh, uh, let's see.

Where is lighting that will make
me look most attractive?

I wonder if he's here yet.

Well unless you've been cruising

singles who don't leave enough
singles, I'd say no.

You know, Max, if my date
turned out to be big bust--

what, bigger than ours?

Then you come over and say that

something suddenly came up and
that I have to go, okay?

Oh, my gosh, this must be him.

You must be Sophie Kuchenski.

I'm Serguisz Bilowski.

Oh.

Wow, I love your dress, I love that!

Something came up and you have to go.

No, no this is perfect.

Would you like to sit down?

Just let me run to
the little boys rooms first.

- Okay?
- Okay.

Who is that?

That's Sophie's new boyfriend.

I see, and where's his boyfriend?

Hello.

Nice to see you again.

I'm wearing my velour
especially for you.

And right now, it's the only
thing soft about me.

Please go away before my date
comes back from the men's room.

You have brought other man in here?

Yes, I met him on Polish dating site.

On polemeetpole.com

you didn't have to go online.
You could meet my pole any time.

No, this will never happen.

You're not my type.

Well, what is your type?

Wow, they have those automatic
hand dryers that blow you.

I love being blown like that.

Those look like two giant
orange traffic cones.

Are you trying to tell me
not to park there?

This is a lady.

Show her some respect.

Sophie has new man in her life.

I am so mad I cannot see straight.

Well, I'm looking right at him
and I don't see straight either.

Max, I think I'm running a slight fever.

Feel my forehead.

Look, you should have learned
by now-- I don't feel anything.

Caroline, I've written down
address of drug store

in South Williamsburg that
has a doctor on site.

Here, I will pay for it.

Unless it is cancer.

Then I'm out.

And, Max, here is check for table seven.

Booyah!

How long is it gonna
take to see a doctor?

I'm definitely getting
something-- I'm pre-sick.

I'm stage one pre-sick.

I need penicillin.

I told you before, you have to man up

and not give in to this sick stuff.

I'm not like you.

I have actual things I feel.

Menachem Goldman.

Menachem Goldman.

This must be the orthodox
Jewish neighborhood.

Either that or we're in ZZ Top-ville.

Max, have some respect.

Hey, I got nothing but respect.

They basically invented southern rock.

I love the Jewish people.

Whenever I felt sick before,
I'd just pop over

to the townhouse next door
and visit Dr. Klein.

So your love was contingent on pills?

We're not that different.

Actually, the Kleins
and I were very close.

I was invited to many
a Passover in their home.

In fact, they called me
their honorary Jew.

Rivka Shemshelewitz.

Rivka Shemshelewitz.

Well, you're no Rivka Shemshelewitz.

Mrs. Klein always said
I had a Bissel Jew.

You had a Jewish vacuum cleaner?

No.
Bissel.

It's a Yiddish word.
It means little.

And this one time I had a bissel flu

and she brought me
chicken soup every day.

So why don't you just
give Dr. Klein a call?

I did three times and no return.

I guess he doesn't want anything
to do with me anymore

because of my father's
financial scandal.

All those years I thought
we were family.

Guess not.

I don't know, ignoring your

needs and pretending you don't exist?

Sounds like family to me.

Caroline Channing, Caroline Channing.

Finally.

Let me do the talking.

I learned a lot of
Hebrew from Mrs. Klein.

These are my people.

Hello, shalom.

Very good, you wanna squeeze
in a couple more before sundown?

Wow, you're as bad
as me trying to be Irish

at the blarney rose for a free beer.

Yar, can I get me a cerveza?

What can I get you ladies,

besides skirts that
are more appropriate?

Sorry, I didn't know it
was an orthodox neighborhood.

You know what, we could just tie
our coats around our waists.

Max?

Oh, and look at the breasts on this one.

Coat on or off?
Make up your mind.

No, Bubala, I'm just saying,
with those big breasts

and that gorgeous hair it's
like looking in a mirror.

It's been a few years, but trust
me, under this wig and smock,

spitting image of you.

Here you go, Esther Rachael.

How else do you think I landed

a handsome doctor like my Anshell?

Oh, doctor?

Doctor?
Doctor, if you could--

oh, oh, what is that
Hebrew word for wait?

You might wanna start
peppering in some English.

Now, Chava?

Now you're telling me
you're too sick to bake.

I need 80 cupcakes.

The bar mitzvah is tomorrow.

You're dead to me!
See you next week.

- We could help.
- We can?

Yeah, give me the card.

Hi, I'm Max and my friend and I
here have a cupcake business

and we'd be happy to
bake as many cupcakes

as you need for the bar mitzvah.

I mean, you need cake, we make cake.

It's bashert.

Look, enough with the "it's a
small Hebrew world after all."

How does 250 sound?

No way, 275.

I have to bake all morning.

It's like looking in a mirror.

They're kosher, right?

Are they kosher? Look at me.

Like looking in a mirror.

Good, I'll call you with the address.

Esther Rachael, if I could
talk to you husband

about getting some antibiotics--

sorry, sundown.

Okay, I've got the kosher
cookbook, salt, flour, sugar,

new mixing bowls, and I
stopped at the goodwill

and got us two appropriately

sad schmatas to wear for tomorrow.

Let's start.

Start?
I'm already half done.

How could you be half done?

You didn't have any kosher ingredients.

Oh, they'll never know, we'll just

tell them they're kosher.

Oh, my God, we can't do that.

Oh, my God, we just did.

They have to be kosher.

Do you want God to smite us?

What's he gonna do?

Take away all my good luck
and your fortune?

You think all those things
labeled low fat are low fat?

It is just a sales gimmick.

I had a low cal ice cream bar once

that popped my top Jean button.

Kosher isn't a sales gimmick.

It's thousands of years of tradition.

We have to respect that.

I don't respect anyone's tradition.

That's kind of my tradition.

Well maybe that's because

you didn't grow up around a family.

Hey, I grew up with a lot of families.

The Manson family, the Jackson
family, the Menendezes.

Wait, is that Menendezes or Menen-di?

Either way, they were like
brothers to me.

Max, we are doing these
straight up kosher.

Fine.

But return those new bowls,
I don't need them.

I can just dump the bacon bits
out of this old one.

Max, please, let's just
start the cupcakes over,

drop them off, get me some antibiotics,

come home, and put me to bed.

All right, I'll make them kosher.

I mean, it's the least
you could do after you

lied to that woman and let her
think you were one of them.

Hey, I don't know who my father is.

I could be half Jewish.

Although it's more likely
I'm half bartender

who demanded my mom figure out
a way to pay her tab.

- Hey!
- Hello.

Serguisz and I are on
way up to my apartment.

He's making me brunch.

Cornish hens splashed
with my special sauce.

I love special sauce, I love that!

Yeah, and I stopped by
because I was hoping you girls

might have some spare
cupcakes for dessert.

Only about 40 of them.

Oh, good!

I'll go up and get started.

Sophie, can I have you keys?

- Oh, yeah.
- Cute place.

Ah, I have keychain just like this.

We are birds of a feather.

I love that!

See, girls.

This is what I like about
my new boyfriend.

He loves so many things.

And vagina ain't one of them.

Max!

We don't know that.

Sexuality is more fluid these days.

It's okay.
He's big, big gay.

So... You know he's gay?

Oh, know it?

I prefer it.

Yeah, my ex-husband
was large male bully.

Yeah, all rough sex
and stains in shorts.

Now all I want is a man who will
spoon me and stay soft.

But what about sex?

Oh, no one does me better than me.

That's the last of them.

Look at us.

I think we look very nice.

Really?

I think we look like the Olson twins.

Well hello, girls.

You look very lovely.

Mazel tov to the family.

What a mitzvah to be part of this day.

How bashert.

Oh, we're still on that ride?

I'm sorry.

It's just, I'm so happy to be

in your warm and wonderful home.

I was very close to my
neighbors, the Kleins.

In fact, they called me
their honorary Jew.

Stop now.

This is like when you tell Earl

you're practically black.

We'll just get our money and go.

Take our money and go?

What are we, barbarians?

Stay and celebrate a little.

But, out here in the kitchen,
away from the men.

Sit, eat, come.

Three of my favorite things to do.

Good looks and funny.
What a catch.

Hadassa, hand me a spoon.

All 100% kosher and so
gorgeous you could plotz.

This one's seen some
Streisand movies, yes?

Wait until you taste my kugel.

Oh, I love kugel.

Tell me, Esther Rachael, are you
ashkenzi or sephardic Jews?

Someone's been on the Internet.

No way, this is a pasta and a dessert?

Ooh, there he is.

My only son.
My little angel.

The bar mitzvah boy who,
today, becomes a man.

Girls, this is Shmuley and his
friend from next door, David.

Say hello to the girls who made
the cupcakes, boys.

Nice to meet you.

Hadassa, Devorah, enough.

Thank you, go.

Enjoy the party.

Have more kugel.

I'll go ask my husband for your money.

See, this is what I love, Max.

The family, the tradition.

The lasagna with the crazy raisins.

And those two little boys,

could they have been more precious?

Yo, yo, yo, what up cupcake bitches?

I'm fixin' to marry me a beeyatch

who bakes like this, son.

Uh, I don't know what's going on,

but I'm pretty sure boys
and girls aren't

supposed to be socializing, right?

Damn, sweetness, your lips are moving

but your ass is doing all the talking.

Uh... Is that Yiddish?

Oh, boys, there you are, come on.

Say goodbye to the cupcake ladies.

Nice to meet you.

Did that just happen or has my
fever suddenly spiked?

That's the first time I ever saw anyone

acting all pimp who still had pimples.

Yo, yo, yo!

And they're back.

What up, Shawties?

What's crackalackin?

Yo, today my boy became a mans.

That's right.

Got my bar mitzvah done, son.

Preach!

So let's get to it.

How much of my mitzvah money
is it gonna take

for you to pop that top and serve me up

some super fine taytays?

Dude, there is not enough money in the--

how much are we talking?

Max!

Yo, don't get all jealous, vanilla cone.

How about you turn around and
make it pop for daddy?

How would you like it
if I told your mother

right on the other side of that door

how you boys were in here
disrespecting us?

How is you gonna say anything
with your mouth full?

Damn, son!

Come in here, ma.
This way.

Don't say anything to her.

Let's just get our money
and get out of here.

Max, she should know.

You wanna ruin their day
and not get paid?

Just keep it to yourself for
five minutes and we're gone.

I want you to meet
my mother, Hinda Fagel.

Ma, this is Max who made
the kosher cupcakes.

And I'm Caroline.

What did the shicksa say?

She said her name is Caroline.

Who cares what her name is?

She looks like the people that

stole my grandmother's good hutch.

But look at this one.

It's like looking in a mirror.

Oy, she's got a fever.

Oh, Max, oh honey, you're burning up.

Oh, no way, I don't get sick.

I get sick.

You're sick.

You'll come, you'll lie down.

Oh, I'm really fine.

We'll just get our money and head home.

Nonsense.
You'll see my husband.

The doctor.

Stop, wait, where are you taking her?

I'm the one who gets sick.

What did she say?

She says she wants your hutch.

You poor baby.

You have a fever of 102.

Just have to rest, Bubala.

I'm really fine.

That towel thing feels awesome.

It's a cold compress,
it'll bring your fever down.

My husband should be in any minute.

Thanks.

I think it's only right to tell you,

I don't know a lot about my
background, so...

I might not be Jewish.

Please, look at you.

You could be my daughter.

I would have liked that.

Always wanted a daughter.

I always wanted a mother.

Oh, did your mother die young?

Sadly, no.

Ooh, you need a kiss.

Oh, good your soup is ready.

Ess a bissel, tatelleh.

Bissel?

I know bissel.

Of course you do.
You're Jewish.

Okay, I'm Jewish, what the hell.

Oh, we don't believe in hell.

We don't?

Awesome.

Oh, thanks.

Call me Bubby.

Thanks, Bubby.

No one's ever blown on my soup before.

What's wrong with them?

♪ That's my boy,
that's my boy, hey, ho ♪

Oh, there he go!

That's what's up, hooker.

First of all, you just scuffed
his mother's freshly-waxed floor

and secondly, you may think
throwing away your family

traditions is cool now, but in
life, bad things can happen.

And one day, when you find
yourself penniless and sick,

you'll need your nice Jewish family

and you'll call them three times
and they won't answer the phone

no matter how much you need antibiotics.

Damn, boo, I stopped listening
after you said freshly-waxed.

Playa!

Max, I'm giving you some amoxicillin

for you to take home.

Now take it all, even when you

start feeling better.

Yes, Dr. Anshell.

Look what I brought.

Sweets for the sweets.

Ooh.

Uh, wait, wait, wait,
before you eat those,

remember how I said
I might not be Jewish?

- Yes.
- Those might not be kosher.

- What are you saying?
- I'm saying they're not kosher.

What is she saying?

Not kosher!

- What?
- Not kosher!

Spit it out, ma!

Spit it out!

Just a minute, it tastes so good.

- You like that?
- Stop.

- You like that?
- Stop it.

- You like that?
- S--that's it!

Listen, hit me with
one more dead president

and you'll be six feet under
with Biggie and Tupac.

You understand me, Jew-Tang Clan?

Skinny bitch came to play!

What kind of girl brings
non-kosher cupcakes

into a kosher home?

Not me-- I'm not that kind of girl.

Yeah, hi, I think I'm that kind of girl.

Max, what are you talking about?

I made sure every single one of those

was up to a rabbi's high standard.

Yes, well, maybe my rabbi
didn't have such high standards.

I'm so sorry, I burned some
and we were running late

and I figured,
four non-kosher out of 80.

So close.

Max, I told you how important

all those traditions are
to a Jewish family.

Yes, you told me about
tradition and family,

but none of that meant anything
until I felt that cold compress.

And she was nice enough
to put it on my head

and I felt what that feels like.

And then Bubby blew on my soup

before she ate the non-kosher cupcake.

Wait, Bubby ate a non-kosher cupcake?

It's a shanda!

It is a shanda.

I'm hoping shanda means

you're forgiven and
we'll pay you anyway.

We are not taking any money.

That's right, you're not
taking anything.

Except for this compress.

Feel better.

Now go, get out of my sight.

And don't wear short skirts.

Esther Rachel,

I wanna talk to you about your son

Shmuley's behavior today.

What are you talking about?

What did my Shmuley do?

I'll tell you what he did.

He became a man.

That's all he did.

Right, Caroline?

I'll say he became a man.

What are you talking about?

Shmuley!

Stay out of it,

this is not our family.

You and I don't have a family.

They still do.

Let the police tell her about him.

So about my Shmuley.

What do you have to say?

Mazel tov, he's a wonderful,
wonderful boy.

Oh, there you are.

Shmuley, David, say goodbye to
the cupcake girls.

Nice to meet you.

Thank you.

So I see no Max.

She still out sick?

It's her first night back.

She should be here any minute.

Did you wanna order something

or wait for your boyfriend?

Oh, see, this is sad story.

Uh, he broke off with me
to date other woman.

And she had penis.

Yeah, I can't compete with that.

Hi, Earl.

There she is, my long lost love.

How you feeling, Max?

I'm pretty good.

Hey, Bubby.

I brought you some chicken soup

for taking care of me
the last couple days.

I enjoyed being your Bubby.

I guess you were wrong, Max.
You and I do have family--

each other.

We're not family until we have

to testify against each other
in a manslaughter trial.

Here, eat this.

I don't want you to
catch what I just had.

Not gonna happen, Max.

I took your advice.

I manned up.

I stared germs in the face.

That's right, when you got sick,
I got balls.

Booyah!

Like looking in a mirror.

Stealing Han's dishes, so we don't
have to clean our at home is genius.

And a little sad.

You kidding? This is the greatest
thing that's happened to me

since I got my
period this morning.

Max, Caroline,
you're stealing my dishes?

Damn it, I didn't think
you could see up this high.

And I didn't think
you could sink this low.

Okay, stop, you're already
robbing me blind

with your
"I'm a waitress" scam.

Sorry, but things have gotten
kind of messy at home.

Yesterday, I had to take a shower
to shower off the shower I took.

You two should get
a cleaning lady.

I have a woman I pay
to clean my apartment.

She is expensive,
but she may charge you less

if you don't also
have sex on her.

I'll look into it.

My grandmother cleaned the house
free of charge.

Of course she didn't have
a say in the matter.

Let's just ask Sophie.
She has a cleaning service.

We have to do something.

Yesterday, I saw a roach
walk out of our apartment.

Look.

I'm gonna tell you
what I told that guy

who asked me to use my butt
to smuggle opium.

I'll do it!

Season 3, Episode 9
"And the Pastry Porn"

Synced by dcdah & Reef


Be ready, Max.

We have to leave as soon as
the cleaning lady gets here.

It's housekeeper etiquette.

In my old life, I go to spin
class and lunch with friends,

but you and I
will just go outside

and watch the guy who just got out
of jail do pull-ups on the light post.

Calvin's out?

I'm not gonna leave.

I want to watch her
clean up my mess.

Yeah, baby.

I've waited my whole life
to have a servant.

I thought you were gonna be it
for the first few weeks

and then I realized
you can't do anything.

[Knock at door]

And even though Sophie
gave us a discount,

the maid still has to call me
"Your Highness."

Mostly because I'm pretty
"highness" right now.

Hi, girls.

Here I am.

Sophie from Sophie's Choice
Cleaning Service.

Meet your cleaning lady
Paulina.

Paulina,
meet the girls.

Mm.

She'd shake hands,
but she only has one arm.

Sophie, she can hear you.

So what?
I know I'm missing arm.

It's not news.

So she lost an arm.

I lost my gold earring
down the garbage disposal

but I was too afraid
to reach into it

because, well, yeah.

Don't worry.

I have one arm but I clean
like I have three.

I put on more makeup,
then I start.

I'm sorry. I didn't realize
when I ordered a cleaning lady

I had to specify
I wanted one with two arms.

You can't afford two arms.

You said you wanted
a good price.

Half the arms,
half the price.

Is that how she lost
the arm, Sophie?

You cut it off
so we could get a discount?

Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, I sawed off
her arm so I could save you 10 bucks.

I start in bedroom.

Wait, before you do,
one question.

How'd you lose it?
James Franco situation?

You had to cut it off
to get loose?

You're not saying no.

Oh, you know what,
let's not go there.

You know, it happened,
it was in the past.

I was trapped
under this big truck.

We get it.

I drove over your arm.

Hey, don't even bother looking
for my good jewelry in there

because I'm already
wearing all of it.

Oh, I'm jealous I don't have arm
to wear cheap jewelry.

Max, I feel bad for her. See?
This is why you leave.

In case they show up with too
much makeup and not enough arms.

Relax, she's tough.
Reminds me of a young me.

Which means I better go
hide my pills from her.

Max, she scares me.

Oh, come on, she's armless.

[Grunts] Everything okay?
You need any help?

I didn't get this far in this
business by taking help.

Help me! Can't you see
I got one arm?

Not gonna be a problem.

I would occasionally
help my maid...

- You're not interested.
- Lift!

Lift, weak girl.
Lift.

Max, come here. We need help
lifting your mattress.

Can you give us a hand?

No! Leave it alone! Leave it alone!
Don't lift up the mattress!

Ah, porno.

Your mind is as dirty
as your apartment!

Yes, it's porn. So what?
What's the big deal?

It's just the body in its natural form,
spread-eagle on a motorcycle.

Why is so much of it
from the '80s?

I like mustaches, okay?

And it's multitasking.
I'm looking for my father.

Stop looking.
Stop looking right now.

Why are you suddenly embarrassed?
Porn hub is your homepage.

Hey, is this a brochure
for pastry school?

Why are you hiding
a pastry school brochure?

Your face is
a pastry school brochure!

Max, it's great you're
interested in pastry school.

- I don't know why you're embarrassed.
- Your face is embarrassed!

Come on, I really think that
this is something we should talk about.

Your face is something
we should talk about!

You made the scary one mad.

That was dumb move.

Your face was a dumb move!

Max?

Max, you never came home after you stormed
out, so I brought you your uniform.

Max?

I live here now.

My new roommates,
the broom and the mop,

don't sneak around
looking at my stuff.

I got everything I need.

Whiskey, toothbrush,
toothpaste.

Well, maybe your
new broommate

will hold back your hair
when you drink too much.

Which, from the looks of it,
will be in about an hour.

Max, we really need
to talk about this brochure.

Look, just because I have
a pastry school brochure

doesn't mean I'm actually
gonna go to pastry school.

Just like having
those porn magazines

doesn't mean I'm actually
gonna ride around on a tiger

performing unspeakable acts
with sailors, probably.

Pastry school
is the same as porn.

It's just a dumb fantasy.

Pastry school is not
like porn.

There is nothing in this brochure
about a girl-on-girl croissant.

That's good toothpaste.

Please stop brushing your teeth.
We have a shift to do later.

Okay, the Manhattan
school of pastry...

Your face is the Manhattan
school of pastry.

You know it isn't.

Max, you could
go here for real.

Tuition is only $3,000 a year.
A lot, but doable.

"A lot but doable?"

Are we talking about pastry
school or fat guy at last call?

Here we are, Max.
Your dream starts now.

What, the one where
I'm a black mermaid?

Would you relax? We're just gonna
look around and get an application.

See all that gorgeous equipment
you get to use if you went here?

Finally you'd have a mixing bowl
that's not a hollowed-out watermelon.

[Knocks]

Can you help me? She's holding me
against my will.

[Laughs] She's kidding.

If you keep this up, young lady,
you are not getting ice cream after.

Fine!

- Come on, here's the office.
- Whatever. Are we almost done here?

I got a court date later.

- Hi.
- Hi.

Hi.

Hi.

I'm not sure we're
in the right place.

Are any of us, really?

We'd like an application.
Could you help us?

Oh, God, I hope so.

I wasn't expecting something this
high-pressure my first day back.

Let's just say I've been under
observation at the nuthouse.

Okay, application.

It's for Max, here. She was
very impressed by your brochure.

Oh, pastry school.
Exciting, right?

I was a chef here once.
And then I wasn't.

Oh, look.
Found the application.

Wow. Really didn't think I was
gonna be able to handle that.

Bebe, if you...

Oh. Bonjour. Good morning.

Uh...

Chef Nicolas, these girls
are here for an application.

Don't worry, I handled it.
Almost didn't, then I did.

Nice work, Bebe.

Oh, do I detect
a French accent? Oui?

Oh, my God,
I can't watch.

French, indeed.
I'm chef Nicolas Saintcroix,

owner and head chef.
Bienvenue.

Caroline Channing.

[French-sounding
gibberish]

Is it over yet?

This is Max.
The application's for her.

'Sup, Frenchie?
You eat snails?

It looks like Bebe
forgot the second page.

Oh, boy, forgot the second page.
That's not good.

I thought I handled it.
Didn't handle it.

It's okay, Bebe.
Breathe in.

[Inhales]

Breathe out. [Exhales]

That's good stuff.

She was quite brilliant.

Then she wasn't.

Here. Fill that out.
And the next step is the pastry exam.

Applicants will have to
make a classic tart,

bring them in tomorrow
for me to taste,

and we will go from there.
Sound good?

Whatever.
Maybe I'll think about it.

Okay, well, maybe you will.
Nice meeting you both.

Hope to see you tomorrow, chef.

He called me chef!

- Yay! Let's go get ice cream!
- No!

You should get started on that tart.
It's due tomorrow.

I got plenty of time. Besides,
pressure ups my game.

I perform my best
when there's a gun to my head.

Ask any of my ex-boyfriends.

This is so not
how I prepare for tests.

I studied three weeks
for a pap smear.

Don't worry, I got this.

A tart's just like a cookie
with some pudding on it, right?

[Coughs]

Max, what is
going on in here?

Turns out a tart's more than a
cookie with some pudding on it!

You've been in here six hours.
You said you had this.

I thought I had this! Turns out I don't!
I haven't even finished a shell.

I didn't know there was a shell.
Did you know there was a shell?

Everybody knows
there's a shell!

What the shell
is wrong with you?

I'm a tart
who can't make a tart!

You could've made
nine shells by now.

I did.
They're all in here. Look.

It's like Shell-mageddon!

Oh, screw it. This one's
gonna be there in a minute.

Let's just get it over with.

No, you can do this. Here. Here.
This still looks ready to go.

Look at me. Look at me.
I'm a waste of two arms.

I can't make a tart!

How's the tart coming?

Han, you're not safe.
Leave.

You haven't even finished the shell?
That's the easiest part!

Han, this is your face.

Well, I should get going.

I didn't know she could
take bitch to the next level.

I am so screwed!

I finally found a situation
my boobs can't get me out of!

Hey, Max. Now, I have all
the faith in the world in you.

But here's a tart from Stop 'n Shop
in case you wanted to hand this one in.

No, Earl.
Max is not a cheater.

Both: Since when?

She is going to make
her own tart.

You, out.

I am never gonna make this shell.
I can't even get it in the pan right.

Max, that looks right.

Oh, my God! I got it in the pan right!
I can do this!

You did it! I knew it!
I helped you. We're besties.

You're not safe. Leave.

I'm telling you, Max, I've tasted
a lot of tarts, and yours is delicious.

You are not the first man
to tell me that.

The first man
to tell me that is in jail.

Here he comes. Look at him.
Here he comes.

Afternoon, ladies.

Bien fondue,
Eiffel Tower.

Okay.

Thank you for coming.
Shall we begin the tasting?

This is exciting, huh?

Uh...

Keep it in your pants.

And now for the tart.

It's Max's first ever.

I ate a slice earlier
and it was like

[French accent]
Having a little piece of heaven.

Don't do anything
you're doing.

It's flaky, creamy...

For a first attempt,
I am very impressed.

Don't be. I made a tart.

It's not like I cured herpes

or invented a reverse microwave
to instantly chill sodas.

Okay, Max.

I will talk it over with my faculty
and we will let you know.

I'll let you know.

Nailed that.

(Han) Max!

Stop stealing my things!
You got a cleaning lady!

Relax.
I am returning what I took.

Here's your plates.

Oh, and here's your ATM card.
I lifted it from your wallet.

Oh, and here's your wallet.

There was $40 in here.

There sure was.

At least give me back
my gift card from Sephora.

Caroline, Han wants
his Sephora gift card back.

Oh, that's not happening.
It's already on my face.

- Max, look, it's from the pastry school.
- Whoo-hoo! My acceptance letter!

Lot of people talking about
my chili in that bathroom.

Oleg, come here.
Han, Earl, stay.

You guys are about
to owe me big.

I am gonna let you witness
something extremely rare.

More rare than a sighting of
Bigfoot or a UFO or Han's penis.

You held me here
so I could hear that?

Behold, the rarest
sight of them all.

You are about to see something
good actually happen to me.

Listen to this.

"Dear Ms. Black,
after careful consideration

"of our large pool of applicants,
we regret to inform you..."

Oh, I guess I didn't get in.

Looking back, we probably
should have insisted

she read that to herself,
first.

I know why she didn't get in.
Her name.

They saw the word "Black"
and stopped reading.

That's why I didn't
get into law school.

I also didn't apply.

This is terrible.
I'm gonna go see if she's okay.

Who does that French frog
think he is?

He thinks he can have the time
of his life tasting my tart

and then never see me again?

He won't let me
into his school?

Well, I won't take no
for an answer.

I am going down there right now

and giving him
a piece of my mind.

I am storming out.

And I am storming back in.

It is dark outside.
That school's not open.

Hey, you. Tart tease,
we need a word.

Oh, boy.

What? You love
my pastries

and then regret to inform me I'm
not good enough for your school?

Well, I regret to inform you
that I am good enough

and I want to know why
you won't let me in here.

Okay, uh, your voice
is an anxiety trigger for me.

I'm going to have to remove myself from
the situation and go sit in the hallway.

Can you come with me? You have
a very calming presence.

Thank you. So few people
think that about me.

But I should stay with Max.

No, I got this handled.
You can have her.

This is the last time
you give me to someone.

Max, your tart was excellent.
The problem was your attitude.

You showed no passion
of wanting to be in this school.

And that is why you didn't get in.
It seemed like you didn't want it.

No, no, no,
that's just my attitude.

I act like I don't want anything
because I never got anything I wanted.

But I do want to go to this school
more than I've ever wanted anything.

It's my fantasy and my dream,

and please stop making me use
these horrible, horrible words!

Just let me in, okay?

Okay.

Wait, for real?

Yes. I needed to see if your passion
was as good as your pastry

and you just showed me it was.

I'm thrilled to have you
on board, chef.

Thanks, chef.

Bebe is having a panic attack
and needs to hold her lemon.

Has anyone seen her lemon?

Caroline, he let me in.
I'm going to pastry school.

Everybody has to
call me "chef" now!

You did it, chef!

You're going to the pastry
school from the brochure!

Aren't you glad
I looked at your porn?

We're roommates. Both single.
Quelle surprise.

So Max, once you fill out these,
you will be officially enrolled.

And of course we will need
your tuition check.

Yup. $3,000.
It's a lot for us.

But if we make some cutbacks,
1/2-ply toilet paper.

Who am I kidding?
No toilet paper, diner napkins.

No, tuition is 24,000.

But the brochure
said $3,000 a year.

You misread it.
It's $3,000 a unit.

There is eight units per year.
24,000.

It costs $24,000?
We can't pay that.

Oh, my God, now I'm never
gonna be able to come here

and I just admitted
I wanted to!

I take back everything I ever
said about wanting anything.

- Max, you can't just storm out.
- Your face can't just storm out!

Look, I will do anything for
that girl to go to this school.

In exchange for tuition,
I could work in the office.

Bebe clearly needs someone
to help take the pressure off

and who better than
a mentally stable

Wharton graduate
like myself?

But I'll do anything.
I'll even wash your floors, okay?

Although I'm sure there's
something better than that.

But if you need me to wash the floors,
I will wash the floors.

Really would prefer
to do anything else,

but I'll do it, 'cause I'll do anything
to get her into this school.

Please no floors.

Okay, I will talk it over with my
staff and I will let you know.

Oh, no, no.

I've seen what happens when you give
people the "I'll let you know."

I'm not going anywhere until
you let me know to my face.

With your face.
Your beautiful, beautiful face.

Max, we're not poor enough?

You're starting a hobo
trash fire in our apartment?

Yup. I'm burning my porn
and pastry school brochure.

You know, all my fantasies.

If I learned anything in life it's that
nothing's more flammable than my dreams.

- Are those my slipper socks in there?
- Yeah, those needed to die too.

Well, while you were in our living
room hosting a burning man festival,

I was at the pastry school getting
us a work-study arrangement.

And...

- You're going to pastry school.
- No way!

Here you go.
Your school uniform.

This is where my name's
gonna go!

My chef name,
Conchita Bonfire.

Thank you for this.

And for everything.

You don't have to thank me.

'Cause with your new skills
I'm gonna use you like Kim uses Kanye.

Or Kanye uses Kim. I'm not sure
which of them is winning.

What kind of work-study
arrangement did you make for me?

It's more of a work-study
arrangement for us.

I'll be working in the office
helping out Bebe,

so I'm working,
you're studying.

You're working
at my school? Mom!

Synced by dcdah & Reef


More lemonade, sir?

Full disclosure,
it's a pitcher of water

we can't get
the lemon taste out of.

Sir?

(gasps)

Max, either this guy's
pretending to be dead

to get out of paying the check

or Oleg's chili
has killed again.

This is my Earl mirror.

I use it during naps to
make sure he's still breathing.

And 80% of the time he is.

(both gasp)

Han, there's a dead body
at table three,

the saddest place to die
other than table two.

Oleg, get out here!

Someone's deader
than Max's emotions.

I really should
throw away that chili.

Let's prop him up outside
with a Salvation Army bucket.

Whatever he collects,
we split in the morning.

Uh, count me out.

If they catch the five of us
with a dead body,

you know they're gonna
blame the black guy.

Okay, everyone grab
a limb and lift.

(screams)

How's everything tasting?

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Max, you're not
gonna believe it.

Bobby's in the shower!

That's how much he likes me,
he's using our shower.

He makes me so happy.

Yeah, I heard.

It sounded like someone
was trying to connect

with a dial-up modem out here.

Sorry.

That's just what I sound like

when I go online.

But really, he makes me
feel like that all the time.

He's perfect.
We're perfect.

Caroline, you shouldn't
get too carried away.

Nothing is perfect.

Except that game
I pitched for the Yankees.

Actually, it is perfect.

We're amazing together,

and I really don't want to hear
from Negative Nancy.

What the--
who's Negative Nancy?

Everyone knows I go by
"Negative Juggs McGee."

I'm just saying you don't
know him that well yet.

I know what this is about,
and it's not me and Bobby.

You're worried
I'm gonna get hurt

because of what happened
between you and Randy.

It's not about that.

I just know guys,

and you haven't been
in a relationship

since Ben was the best Affleck.

Hey there.

It's amazing,
I'm somehow less clean now

than when I went in.

I gotta get going, babe.

I'll meet you
at the dessert bar.

We're having lunch with
his mom and his sister.

I'm almost part
of the family now.

Well, if you were
part of the family

you'd be
addicted to Diet Pepsi

and get into mall fights
on Black Friday.

Then I might be a cousin.

Oh, you know what?
I'll walk you out.

If Homeless Larry
tries to grab you,

-I can fend him off.
-Yeah.

Oh, careful, he's got
barbecue tongs now.

Aww.

Look at those two.

That PDA is making me want
to M-A-S-T-U--

Ah, I would stop you,

but I doubt you know
what comes after U.

Usually me.

What do you guys want?

Well, we're looking
for some entertainment.

Oleg and I have
binge-watched everything.

You know, we even watched
the Santa Clarita Diet.

Now that's one diet
I'm not gonna stick to.

(phone chimes)

Oh, Bobby must have
left his phone here.

-Oh, crap.
-What's wrong?

It's a text from Bobby's ex,
Jessica.

It says, "Call me about baby."

Do Bobby and Jessica
have a baby?

Are they going to have one?

And why does Bobby have
a rose gold iPhone?

Maybe he got it
with his yearly mammogram.

I knew this relationship
was too good to be true.

Looks like
I'm not Negative Nancy,

more like Reality Check Rita.

Then why the hell
have I been calling you Max?

Oh, just a heads-up,

Bobby's family is on
its way over,

so any X-rated puppeteering
you have to do,

now is the time.

Speaking of Bobby
and people he knows,

uh, does he still talk
to what's-her-name, Jessica?

Pfft, no.

She is long gone,
like my bangs

or democracy.

Bobby never brings her up.

We just talk about
our common interests,

like how much
we like my hair

or how pretty I am.

Yeah, but circling back
to other people,

which is very hard with you,

Jessica, do they talk?
Text?

Share custody?

Max, why are you
asking about her?

Jessica is his ex-girlfriend.

All Bobby's ever said about her
is that she's a wedding planner

and she's out of his life.

I know that's hard
for you to believe,

like the moon landing.

Hey!

You never see their faces.

They brought back no cheese.
Just saying.

-Now, please, just drop it.
-Fine-ah!

Fine-ah.

Oh, hi, Denise.

Where's your mom and Bobby?

Oh, we don't ride
the subway together

in case there's a crash.

Somebody's gotta be around
for Black Friday.

Well, now that
Bobby's sister is here,

I don't wanna mess up
your perfect brunch.

I'm going to the diner,
where the only perfect thing

is the owl-to-rat ratio.

So you own this place?

Man, I'd love to be my own boss.

Mine treats me like garbage.

If I want to get freaky
with the UPS guy on my break,

that's my time.

So what is it you do,
besides the UPS guy?

I work the counter at
the Mail Boxes and Other Things.

It's like Mail Boxes Etc,
but we have other things.

Oh.

I know it sounds cool,

but my boss
is always on me.

Well, maybe you should
talk to your boss.

You know, tell him how you feel,
stand up for yourself.

I'm not great
with confrontation,

partially because
I had bad depth perception.

Like, I have no idea how
far away you are right now.

I'm right here.

On second base.

Well, I think you're great,

and not inappropriate at all.

And if your boss can't see that,
well, maybe you should quit.

So the gentleman who looked
like Abraham Lincoln,

was that a hipster
or an Orthodox Jew?

Either way, I don't understand
why you gave him a dollar.

Mom, I quit!

Wait, your mom is your boss?

Is it the UPS man?

He's your godfather.
It's untoward.

Where's this coming from?

From my new best friend

and women-in-business mentor,

Caroline.

(clicks tongue)

You told my daughter
to quit working for me?

I'm sure she meant
a different Caroline.

I don't know.

Everything got blurry
after she touched my boobs.

Han, I'm about to say
what you said to me

when you were trying to get
into an R-rated movie.

I need your help.

I told you three times,
I don't fit up drain pipes.

Listen, I just saw this text
on Bobby's phone

from his ex-girlfriend,
Jessica.

I think they might have
a secret baby together.

Wow, that would really
devastate Caroline.

More importantly, Bobby and I
are rose gold buddies.

I just have to make sure
before I say anything

to panic Caroline.

I need to do
some detective work,

so you and I are gonna go down

to Jessica's
wedding planning business

and pretend we're a couple.

Obviously I'll be the groom.

Max, this might come
as a surprise to you,

but I'm a very busy man.

I don't have time for your
sophomoric high jinks.

Uh, that's what they said
to Adam Sandler,

and it only made him richer.

I'm flattered
I was your first choice.

Man, she asked me
five people ago.

I think she was down
to you or a broom,

and the broom was busy.

If I'm doing this, we have
to use our best acting skills,

'cause who's gonna believe
you landed me?

Ugh, really wish Steve the Broom
didn't have Pilates at 4:00.

I'm so sorry, Mrs. Ferraro.

I had no idea
you were the awful boss

that was making
her life miserable.

Bobby, why didn't you tell me

your mom owns
a Mail Boxes and Other Things?

I didn't want you to date me
for the unlimited bubble wrap.

Denise can't cope
out in the world.

You know how many times
she's touched

our neighbor's electric fence.

To be fair,
they installed it

to keep her from falling
in their pool.

Well, you did this.
You take care of it.

She's your responsibility now.

Bobby, bring home
some deserts for me.

From Dunkin'!

Bobby, I am so sorry.

I don't want our first fight
to be over a misunderstanding.

I want it to be
about something important,

like if you want a soul patch.

We're not fighting.

This is a bump.

I think you're overreacting.

Then why are you yelling?

I'm not yelling.

Man, what's with
all the yelling?

Oh, Oleg,
let's see where this goes.

It's already better
than everything on Amazon.

Just with it was a little bit
more Game of Thrones-y.

And by that,
I mean a little more topless.

And by that I mean,
oh, oh, Bobby.

Caroline, we're not fighting.

But please,
don't get in the middle

of my ma and Denise again.

My aunt tried once.

Now she's really scared
of ceiling fans.

I gotta go.
I still can't find my phone.

Oleg, this is our new show.

Grab the popcorn from my purse.

You want cheddar cheese
or kettle corn?

You know I can hear you, right?

Okay, this must be
Jessica's office.

Oh, here, better put this on
for the bit.

This was smuggled out
of North Korea

by my great-grandfather
in his great backside.

Oh, the classic tush cut.

Now remember,
we're detectives.

We're like Cagney and the only
guy I could get to come with me.

Hi.

You must be Max and Han.

I'm Jessica.

Thanks so much for coming in.

Oh, you guys are so super cute.

(chuckles)

How does our cuteness
compare to, say, a baby?

Wow, you're thinking ahead.

Or are you expecting
a little one?

Ha, I've already got
a little one.

What about you?

Making fun of my size
is kind of our thing.

Like, making sweet love.

So I'm with child.
Are you?

Actually, I'm--

So for the wedding,

I was thinking
of a nature theme.

Something in the park,
whimsical of course,

with lanterns and flowers,
a big tent.

Oh, oh, really?

You want a big top, Pee-wee?
Jessica was talking.

Sorry, dear.

The old ball and chain
hates when I get a word in.

Sign me up for a lifetime.

Sorry, uh, I missed
what you were saying

about having a baby.

We're not here
to talk about me.

Let's talk about you
and your affair.

Oh, I'm definitely
gonna have one.

Thanks for texting, Caroline.

I've been a little lost since
you made me quit my job with Ma.

Mostly 'cause I couldn't
find the L train.

But I saw a guy kill a chicken.

I thought you and I
could get together

and figure out
your next career move,

which does not necessarily
need to be forward.

No, I'm not going back
to my ma's store

no matter how much I miss
hiding in boxes

and scaring people.

Well, let's brainstorm
on your next career move.

Hmm.

I've always wanted
to be a model.

I've been told I look great
with my pants down.

You are more than just a body.

Hmm, sometimes
I'm not so sure.

Hey, what about working here?

How hard can it be?
You do it.

Actually, this job
requires a lot--

You don't have
to talk me into it.

I'll do it.

Give me the Frisbee
with the drinks on it.

Okay, I guess you could help out
until Max gets back.

Or until someone gets hurt,
probably me.

As magic hour
descends over the city,

Max and I will retire
to the honeymoon suite

where she carries me
over the threshold.

Excited for what's to come.

Well, it's not gonna be
either of us.

So, uh, back to you, Jess.

Ooh, the party favors
could be little compasses

that lead you to your table.

Or to a waiting escape boat.

Are you sure you two
are right for each other?

Are you kidding?

I am obsessed with him.

We're two people madly in love.
Right, Max?

Bring those lips
over here and...

don't forget to invite
your tongue to the party.

Oh, I'm sure
she can see we're in love

without having to put
our mouths on each other.

Please.

She's shy.
Once she starts,

it's hard to put the snake
back in the can.

Could you feel the heat
from where you are?

Are you wearing lip gloss?

Listen, I've been down
this road before.

With a stroller?

I'm just asking because
that's how I push him around.

This wedding isn't making it
to the banquet hall.

I don't even think
it's making it to the car.

-You two should go.
-Ah.

You're moody.

Uh, are you pregnant?

Meh?

Are you sure you want
the flantinis?

Little tip, go buy yourself
a tub of Breyers

and a bottle of vodka
and save yourself 30 bucks.

Okay, let's go back over this.

The job of a waitress is to get
people to buy things here.

Also you're standing
on my feet right now.

Are you sure?
Because I don't feel anything.

Gosh, you know what?
Denise is my favorite character.

I bet you she looks like
a million bucks

with her pants down.

You know who looks like
2 million bucks

with her skirt
around her ankles?

How--how--

How did I get so lucky?

There she is,

my big shot daughter
who doesn't need me anymore.

And the woman who keeps taking
my babies from me.

I'm getting a drink.

Oh, great, now they're
all working here.

Denise called my ma
to brag about her new job

at your dessert bar.

Bobby, I know you said
not to get involved,

but I wanted to end our fight.

Also, I think your sister
may have broken my pinky toe.

Oh, that's my fault.

I didn't teach you the stop sign
when she gets too close.

Am I too close?

FYI, Ma, it's going great here.

Well, if things
are going so great,

why don't you get
your own place

and start toasting your own
waffles in the morning?

Maybe I will.

Maybe I'll move in
with Caroline,

and she can teach me how
to use her toaster oven.

We actually have
a pretty small place,

and our toaster oven
is being used

as a tanning bed for mice.

Oleg texted me
this show was good.

I just finished
 The Walking Dead.

It hit a little too close
to home.

Yeah, have a seat.

The crazy mom just showed up.

And the hot sister
is yelling at her.

Caroline!

I'm not being negative,
but Bobby's a dirtbag.

I'm 100% sure he has, had,

or is going to have
a baby with Jessica.

(all gasp)

And I'm 100% sure I'm gonna have
a cold sore in the morning.

Baby?
What's going on?

Bobby, what is going on?

This really is
the golden age of TV.

Max, what are you talking about?

I'm talking about
the text I saw on your phone

from Jessica about your baby.

(all gasp)

What are you doing
with my phone?

Bobby, do you have
a baby with Jessica?

Bobby, you have
a baby with Jessica?

That takes the sting
out of losing Denise.

A baby?
I don't have a--oh.

Oh, wait.
I have a cat.

A cat named Baby
with Jessica.

BOTH: Ohh.

ALL: Ohhh.

So what's happening
around here?

Why didn't you just ask me?

Because I was
respecting your boundaries,

which is why I stole your phone.

Makes sense.

Her friend here
forced my daughter

to abandon
the family's business.

Neither one of them
knows about boundaries.

I'm throwing these
small glasses away.

They're stupid.
(glass shatters)

Well, I'm pretty upset myself.

I wasted $20 on the domain name
MaxAndHansWedding.com.

We're not really
getting married!

We only went to see Jessica
to find out

if she had a baby
with Bobby, you boobie.

You went to see Jessica?

Seems like everyone's in a fight
except for me and Bobby.

Oh, no, we're fighting now.

I saw that text
on Bobby's phone,

and I didn't want you
getting hurt.

The only person
who got hurt was me.

I kissed Han on the lips.

ALL: Ohhh.

Max, you stalked his
ex-girlfriend without me?

Pretty shady move
by your friend, Caroline.

We may want to think
about finding another roommate.

Okay, that's enough.

Denise, you need to go back
and work for Ma,

and not only because
that's the only job

you're capable of doing,

but also 'cause
Ma's lost without you.

And, Max, you need to trust

that I'm not like
every other dirtbag.

And, Caroline, when
two people love each other,

they're gonna fight.

Are the two people
that love each other us?

Don't get bullied
into anything, Bobby.

Of course
I'm talking about us.

I love you, Caroline.

I love you, too.

Great.

Two white people
falling in love.

You don't ever
see that on TV.

You know what, Ma?
This place is dumb.

I'll come back and work at
Mail Boxes and Other Things.

You know what?

You're the other thing.

Come here.

Oleg, get the butt wipes
out of my bag.

This is a real tear-jerker.

My second favorite kind
of jerker.

I should get going, too.

I gotta check
some text messages.

And why is my screensaver
a shirtless Vin Diesel?

You're welcome.

You know trust is hard for me.

That's why I got kicked out
of Cirque du Soleil.

You're the first person in
my life I can actually count on.

Be so great if they made out
right now.

You were the first person
I could count on, too.

I love you, Max.

Okay, we're not there yet.

(cash register dings)

(rock music)

*

Sandwich, burger.

Why the big smile, Han?

You going commando
under those corduroys?

No, Max, I am happy today
because diner clientele

has finally changed for the better.

Look, two parties of cool hipsters

are sitting at tables near wall.

You think those are six hipsters?

Okay, let's go over
this one more time.

Hipster or homeless pop quiz, ready?

- Ready.
- Hipsters wear?

Skinny jeans.

- Homeless wear?
- Dirty jeans.

- Hipsters listen to?
- Radiohead.

- Homeless listen to?
- The voices in their head.

- Hipsters have?
- Beard and a blog.

- Homeless have?
- Beard and so much sadness.

I see sadness, there and there.

I'll handle this.

I told you before,
I don't want you kind in here.

Take a trendy hike.

Better step it up.
The apple store closes at ten.

Max, why did you
kick out the hipsters?

'Cause I could not
be in the background

of another Instagram photo.

Here's the last check, Earl.

And, Max, they stiffed us on the tip

but they forgot their camera.

Oh, I'll give it to Oleg.

He can take one of
his special pictures.

That way, when they
come back to get it,

everyone will have been stiffed.

Well, good night, ladies.

I gotta get home
before the snow starts.

It's not gonna snow, Earl,
it's 50 degrees.

Oh, it's gonna snow, trust me.

I couldn't tell
when my first wife was coming,

but I can sure tell
when a storm is coming.

All right, so what's the plan?

What are we gonna do if it does snow?

Opening my balcony doors
and watching it fall

like fresh white linen and
then running across the street

to the park to make snow angels.

Yeah, that's snow when you're rich.

The only snow angels
you'll see this year

are the six crack addicts
frozen to our stoop.

Oh, not to mention
the adorable frozen horse

we have illegally
living in the backyard.

Max, don't overreact.

Chestnut's fine.

It's not gonna snow for weeks.

All right, have it your way.

But I wouldn't want
to be the next tenants

who have to figure out
why a pissed off horse

is haunting a Brooklyn apartment.

I was cold and she thought
she knew weather patterns.

Oleg, take a picture of your
junk on this customer's camera.

Done.

Aren't you gonna ask why?

No need.

I just saw Oleg's...

Yeah, that might have been my fault.

Kind of a shock seeing it
for the first time.

Max, I don't like you implying

that I would ever
be cruel to Chestnut.

I'm not implying it.

I'm saying it outright.

It's winter.

And it's not like
I've not been thinking about it.

But Chestnut belongs
in a special home.

You belong in a special home.

I've done some research,

and I found a retreat
in the Grand Tetons

where newly-divorced women
come to hug horses

to help them gain back
their ability to trust.

The only Grand Tetons
Chestnut trusts are mine.

Lady, you gotta get
a reality check real quick

'cause Earl thinks it's gonna snow.

Earl also thinks the theme from shaft

was stolen from a cassette tape
he sent out in 1975.

Shut your mouth.
That happened.

Max, it's not gonna snow.

I know snow.

We owned a ski chalet
in Saas-Fee Switzerland

and I think I know more than
anyone in this restaurant

about living in cold climes.

Snow is coming.

Yo, Swiss miss, you wanna have
a conversation about cold climes

with Snowleg over there?

Oh, Max, I almost forgot.

The camera.

I think you'll be very pleased.

I made a little video as well.

Why are you wearing two coats?

Same reason I wear two condoms.

In case one breaks.

What the?

Well, good morning,
world's worst weather girl.

I have never seen so much sunshine.

You know what that means?

Earl wrote shaft.

Max, I know it snowed,
you don't have to tell me.

I'm surrounded by so much white
stuff I'm like Al Pacino

in the last scene of Scarface.

What are you wearing?

You look like a bag of
crazy garbage grew arms.

It's the hefty 2011
winter collection.

I gave Chestnut my coat.

This is the only way
to keep the snow off me.

Look at poor Chestnut.

What is he wearing on his hooves?

I cut up my Fendi cashmere leggings.

I grabbed them when we
raided the town house.

I thought ahead for me,
but not for him.

He is humiliated in
those ladies clothes.

He looks like j. Edgar hoover.

I've been out here
sweeping since 4:00 A.M.

But it just keeps coming down.

What is your problem, snow?

I used to love you!

Maybe we should ask your old doorman

"insert generic
Irish name here" to come help.

I know their names.

Day James, night James
and black James.

So your plan is you're gonna
sweep the snow away till spring

while the horse
is trapped under this tarp?

Which I'm pretty sure was
covering the out of business

Cuban restaurant down the street.

They were out of business
and I left a note.

What did it say?
"I'm loco, gracias."

No, it said, "sorry I took
your roof, hang in there.:

Max, don't be so negative.

Doesn't matter where
it came from, it's working.

I just need to secure
this tarp a little.

Stop, you were gonna climb on

an icy chair in six inch heels
and break your neck

and then I'm gonna be stuck
with a horse in leggings

and you in a wheelchair
with a chopstick in your mouth

tapping out, "I'm sorry,
I thought that would work."

I learned to build when I volunteered

with habitat for humanity.

Looking back, they had
so much more than I have now.

Okay.

I gotta go to my babysitting job

and when I get back,
you and I are gonna sit down

and come up with
a more realistic home

for j. Edgar hoofer.

Max, he lives here.

And I'm telling you, this is working.

What I'm doing is
actually kind of brilliant.

Now I'm worried about
those houses you built.

Hey, Peach.

Max, I have the most incredible news.

Lawyer finally found
a loophole in your prenup?

I wish, no.

I just got an email

and I have made it to the final round

of casting for
Real Housewives of Tribeca.

Real Housewives of Tribeca?

They're doing neighborhoods now?

What's next, Real Housewives
of from here to there?

The producers are on their
way over and I want everything

to be perfect when they see
Brad and Angelina.

Uh, Peach, are you aware
that your children

are being eaten by clothing?

The snowsuits are Burberry.

And the padding hides
Angelina's weight problem.

Okay, you have to stop saying that.

She doesn't have a weight problem.

She's gained 25 pounds in one year.

Yeah, 'cause she started at zero.

Max, we all have
to look our best, 'cause ready?

The last spot in the show is
between me and Misty Mastbaum.

I thought she was your bestie.

She is, but my bestie's a bitchy.

She's crazy competitive.

As soon as we were
approached about the show,

she adopted a three-legged corgi
and named it Mr. Pickle.

That's crazy bitchy.

So now, I'm looking up
handicapped animals

to impress the producers.

Oh, you want a handicapped animal?

I got your handicapped animal.

I know a homeless horse
with gender identity issues.

I was thinking
something cute, but damaged.

Like a one-eyed French bulldog.

What if I told you that this
horse was a celebrity horse?

Tell me more.

My friend, Caroline Channing...

How do you know Caroline Channing?

She's my AA sponsor.

Makes sense.

Go on.

Anyway, she has this cute,
but crazy damaged horse

and since her life
flipped upside down,

he needs a good home.

Well, I'd have
to meet Caroline first.

Bring her by on Saturday.

Max, what an amazing idea.

Misty is literally going to die.

I am so thrilled
you have a drinking problem.

Did you have to
put him in my bedroom?

It was the easiest room
to horse proof.

You have so little of worth.

You can stop googling.
I already found

a perfectly good place to put him.

You're not still suggesting
I give Chestnut to Peach Landis?

Max, look at me.
Look at me in the eyes.

Are you high?

No, I couldn't find my bedroom stash

since you moved everything around.

Chestnut needs a home with affection

and Peach won't even
hug her children.

She pays you to do that.

That's why it's perfect.

She'll pay for the fancy stable

and we'll go and hug Chestnut
for her whenever we want.

You just need to
go meet her and it's done.

I have the DNA of a rich girl,

even though I'm lying in bed
with you in a tenement

and I bought
my dinner tonight with dimes.

Chestnut and I are old money.

And old money doesn't
parade itself around

in front of cameras
and beg for attention.

Hey, you're not
the only one with old money.

I've had a dollar in my jeans

I've been carrying around
for three weeks.

You're meeting Peach Saturday,

and we're saying good-bye
to the horse.

Why is getting rid
of Chestnut so easy for you?

Didn't you ever
have a pet as a child?

Yes, I had a puppy.

And after a week
of living with my mom,

he pulled the car over and put
us out on the side of the road.

She got rid of it?

Look, pets are not my thing, okay?

I already have
something needy and Fluffy

that'll die if I don't
take care of it... you.

Go, it's your turn
to go check on him.

No, I went the last time
and caught him eating my bra.

Don't exaggerate.
He only ate half of it.

Oh, I'm sorry, you're right,
I should be more positive.

One of my cups is half full.

What's going on in there?

I don't suppose there's any way

you took a giant dump
on your dresser?

You can't blame Chestnut.
He's probably nervous.

After wearing your leggings,

he's getting ready
for his fame audition.

He's a maniac, maniac on all fours.

Oh, Max, here's something.

The Ivy bridge
riding stables in Brooklyn.

Only five Miles away.

It says on their website
that their horses

are featured in
commercials and films!

Can you say Chestnut,
star of the war horse sequel?

Did you take the weed
from my bedside table?

Look at me.

Look at me in the eyes.

Are you high?

Honestly... a little.

Close that and go to sleep.

No, I'm still reading.

Oh look at that, I just pulled
down your browser history.

Interesting list.

Kitten plays a keyboard,

kitten sneezes and
farts at the same time?

Give me that, that's private.

Kitten folds a t-shirt!

Oh, kitten rings a doorbell.

I thought you said
you weren't into pets.

I'm not!

It's a kitten ringing a doorbell!

He's trying to get in like people.

You have a secret
soft spot for animals.

No, I'm just into freaky kittens.

There's one who puts on
a snakeskin suit

and goes on a business trip.

That's not soft.
That is freaky.

Fine, you're telling me to get
a reality check about Chestnut.

But you need one too.

You're gonna miss him when he's gone.

Max, are you listening?

Max, don't worry.

I know it's all
gonna work out perfectly

at the stables tomorrow.

I'm not worried.

The man's not here yet.

Damn it, turn us around Max,
we have to enter again.

This is the third time.

Max, come on, we borrowed
these coats from Oleg

to make a dramatic star entrance.

If you want me to fake it again,

you have to buy me dinner
and call me pretty.

Fine, then help me down quickly.

I don't wanna be mid-dismount
when the stable guy walks in.

God, ugh.

You just sat on my face.

Like I haven't done enough for you.

Oh, hello, are you Tony?

Last time I checked.

Oh, jeez.

I'm Caroline Channing.
We spoke on the phone.

And this is Chestnut.

Max, step back.

Oh, great.
I'll just be over here

like the awkward father
in the background

on Toddlers and Tiaras.

Well, here he is.

And as we discussed,
Chestnut is a champion jumper

his dressage is impeccable,

he's ribboned three times
at the Hampton Classic,

and he comes from
a historically elite line

of distinguished show horses.

And he pees like
a civil rights fire hose.

Max, step further back.

Come on, let's cut to the chase.

He's nice, brown,
he looks sick in leggings,

and he's free,
so take him or leave him.

When'd you say he was a jumper?

From 2005 to 2010.

He was in a class by himself.

Well, maybe he was a jumper,

but he isn't anymore.

What?

Well, he's a little out of shape.

Well, you have a gut.

Whoa! I'm just saying
he's seen better days.

I'm just saying your hair
is falling out in fistfuls.

- Whoa!
- Okay, okay.

Let's not get personal,
we all want this to work.

He's the one who's getting personal

going after Chestnut like that.

Okay, you tell me,

when's the last time he's exercised?

When's the last time you exercised?

Wow, show business is rough.

All right, it's Tony, right?

Last time I checked.

All right, Tony,
you'll have to forgive her.

She really loves him
and wants this to work out.

Bottom line is,
even a free horse isn't free.

I still have to feed him
and take care of him

and truth be told, this horse
isn't gonna make me a penny.

If my film guy comes in here,
he's gonna pick that beauty

over this one.

Oh.

So it's not gonna work out, girls.

All right, well, we got
other offers, fatty.

Come on, let's go.

You know, maybe next time
before you let someone

ride five Miles across
Brooklyn in a toxic, Russian,

cologne-soaked rent-a-fur,

you should be clear
that the film business,

even for horses,
is ageist and elitist.

And, yes, we may have
seen better days,

but with hard work,
determination and a little luck,

one day we'll be back on top.

Yeah, and I'm not impressed by
your big star pony over there.

He's just standing still.

You wanna impress me?

Have him meow and ring the doorbell.

Don't take it personally, Chestnut.

Those horses have had work done.

maybe you wanna take the cinch
sack off before you meet Peach.

No it's snowing again
and I'm a penniless beggar.

I should look like one.

Besides, she'll probably
think it's a look.

All right, I know this one on one

with Peach isn't your ideal scenario,

but it's what's best for Chestnut

so man up and face reality.

You're right.

And my friend, Caroline Channing...

What is it?

You might be ready to face reality,

but are you ready to face reality TV?

The place is crawling
with Peach clones

and TV cameras ready to meet you.

She totally set us up.

Are you kidding me?

Fabulous, this is awesome,
just awesome.

She's using the Caroline
Channing freak show

to get herself on another freak show.

All right, you're right, let's
go, you don't have to do this.

No, if I made Chestnut parade around

and be humiliated in public,

then I have to be
willing to do the same.

Here, hold my coat.

You always have those with you?

Yes, I'm from Manhattan.

- Okay, thank me for coming.
- What?

Thank me for coming, that's
what people did all the time

when I was a billionaire.

Thank you for coming.

No, thank you for inviting me.

Wow, that's so cool.

Don't freak out.

I'm about to get my rich on.

So when we go in there
I'll introduce you?

Oh, you don't have to.

Rich people always pretend

to know each other.

Now open that door,

and let's get my baby a home.

Peach.

I wanna thank you for inviting
me into your beautiful home

and showing me such kindness

during this very difficult,
difficult time.

Ladies, I would like you all to meet

my dear friend, Caroline Channing.

Who, in light of her recent
very difficult, difficult

financial troubles, has asked me
to adopt her damaged pet horse

who was brought to my attention
by my alcoholic servant, Max.

Right over there.

Caroline,

thank you for coming.

No, thank you for inviting me.

I'm proud of you.

No, I'm proud of you.

I just got the chills again.

Oh, Max, look at him.

He's smiling.

He likes this place.

Yeah, it's almost worth you
being humiliated on reality TV.

Oh, I'll never be on that show.

I didn't sign the release.

What?

Old money don't sign.

You're gonna love it here, huh?

Aren't you gonna love it here?

A nice big stable.

Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

Maybe I should come home and
live with my best friend, Max.

What about Caroline?

She can sleep under the tarp.

So I guess you found your weed.

No, this is just something we
do when we're alone together.

It's kind of our thing.

You really love Chestnut, don't you?

He's all right.

He's no kitten.

Okay, I'll see you soon, Chestnut.

You want a minute alone?

I'll be out front.

Hey.

This is probably gonna
seem ridiculous to you

because you're a horse
and I'm just some lady

that's been slipping you carrots
for the last few months, but...

I really got attached to you.

This is way more than most
horses get out of me.

I wasn't even this upset when
they discontinued tan m&ms.

I, um...

I really haven't had much
go right for me in my life,

and I'm pretty sure things are
gonna keep getting worse but,

you were a good thing.

And when everything sucked,

you were the best thing we had going.

And you're fuzzy too.

You're so fuzzy, and no one can argue

that touching a warm, fuzzy
thing isn't straight up lovely.

So, thank you for everything
you did for us, but...

Especially for being fuzzy.

Max, are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine, I'll always be fine.

Are you crying?

Yeah, I'm crying,

'cause I wish I could live here.

Don't worry, we'll come visit,

and we'll find a way
to bring him home in the spring.

Come on.
I have a pocket full of dimes.

Let's go get
some convenience store taquitos

and wash 'em down with
blue raspberry wine coolers.

They're on sale at the bodega.

Two four packs for five dollars.

You know exactly what to say
to cheer a broke sista up.

And when we get home, I found a video

of a kitten singing Bruno Mars.

Pick up. Table ten, table 12, table 69.

Oleg, there is no table 69.

There could be.

Oleg just sixty-nined me,

and now I don't remember
any of the table numbers.

Look, he's never gonna
stop sixty-nining us.

Forget the table numbers.

Here's how you remember your orders.

You just give people nicknames.

Look, I got thin cee lo,

fat rihanna, jon beret ramsey,

and kristen bad wig.

Oh, okay.

I got seth rogaine,

child molester moustache,

and lesbian justin bieber.

- Good.
- Thanks.

Pick up. Table six.

ty-nine.

So can I get you anything else?

Coffee? Dessert? Morning-after pill?

Okay.

Getting it on in a restaurant.

I once made love to a
young angela lansbury

in a booth just like that.

Murder she wrote?

more like "harder she begged."

Earl, why isn't everyone you?

Yo, what's up, mama?

Oh, hey, johnny.

Usual? Two coffees to go?

Yeah, and can I get
two of your cupcakes?

Which two?

You know which two.

The discounted day-olds?

Yeah, girl.

Hey, my bro and friend.

Hey, what's up, big guy?

Max, your boyfriend is here.

'cause who doesn't?

Well, your face gets
red when you see him,

and you suddenly act like nice person.

If that's not love,
I don't know what is.

He doesn't know what love is.

The only thing he ever
loved was a stepladder.

Johnny, here's your stale
cake and burnt coffee.

Just how I like it.
What do I owe you?

It's on me.

You wish it was on you.

There's nothing going on.

He just comes in here to get coffee

because he tags billboards all night.

Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

Listen, renaissance fair,

why don't you be a good wench
and clean up your counter?

Until the cupcake business takes off,

i'm just gonna have to
find a temp job online.

Can I close this window that says
"mexican painkillers"?

Yeah, yeah, but, uh,
bookmark it first.

Here we are. Craigslist. Okay.

How does this job sound?

Disgusting and depraved.

You didn't even hear it yet.

Did I not hear "craigslist"?

Oh. Here's something easy I could do.

A professional organizer.

You're not a professional organizer.

You're barely a professional waitress.

I am a genius at organizing things

and getting them out of the way.

I recently lost all my money and
the promise of a bright future,

and I've organized that
into a file in my head

labeled "do not open
until you are stronger."

If I can handle that for myself,

I can certainly handle a
stranger's light filing.

If I had known all that craziness

was going on in your head,

I would have ordered you
some mexican pain killers.

Or the peruvian.

They're stronger,

but sometimes they make you
lose control of your hands.

Thought that was an ibuprofen.

What is johnny doing
here at 3:00 a. M.?

Thought it was a rapist or something.

Rapists don't knock and wave.

And if they looked like that,
we wouldn't call them rapists.

We'd call them... Johnny!

What are you doing here?

I'm here to talk to you guys

about the church of latter day saints.

And I have to pee.
Can I use your bathroom?

No problem. Don't forget to
tip the bathroom attendant.

What's up, caroline?

Just trying to find a day job

where I won't get
handcuffed to a radiator.

On craigslist?

This is so romantic.

Jumping over the back wall

to drop down and see you
in the middle of the night?

It's very romeo and juliet.

it is very romeo and juliet.

He has to pee,
and I'm the nearest toilet.

Please. That's just an excuse.

The man defaces buildings. And what?

He draws the line at peeing on them?

He came by here to see you.

Pull your hair back.
It's kind of in your face.

Pull yourself back.
You're kind of in my face.

Thanks, guys.

I was tagging a building nearby,

and while I was on the roof

I saw that your light was on,

so I thought I'd stop in and say hey.

- Hey.
- So, johnny,

you just saw our light
on from the roof nearby?

Interesting.

Do you always look down
when you're up that high?

Not really.

Interesting.

Flying solo tonight.
My lookout guy went into rehab.

It's kind of a pain.

It's really a two-person operation.

Ugh, such a bummer when people

can't handle their heroin.

Hey, max, what are you doing
tomorrow night after work?

Any desire to be my lookout guy?

I might have some desire
to be your lookout guy,

but as far as the "guy"
part of "lookout guy" goes,

full disclosure-

What, you don't have a penis?

Oh, I have one.

In a drawer in my bedroom.

If the cops come tomorrow,

I will run like a girl.

Okay. So pick you up
at the diner at 2:00?

- Cool.
- Cool.

Cool.

And then romeo left.

So romantic. All the weeks
of flirting and game playing

have finally led to this-

You two on a late-night roof rendezvous.

Hey, genius organizer,

why don't you put all that
garbage in a file labeled

"I've seen too many
katherine heigl movies"?

I'm just saying, he likes you.

He likes you with his penis.

There. 3f.

All right. You're here.

Goodbye. Go organize.

No, I said you have to wait

until I open the door and
check out if it's safe.

It's my day off.
You're the one with the job.

And you're the one who
freaked me out so much

about going into
a stranger's apartment.

What did I say that was so bad?

You told me he'd cut off my face

and wear it as a party hat.

I said... "probably."

Probably cut off your face.

Nothing bad is gonna
happen to you, okay?

Okay.

It's a safe-enough
looking building, right?

Yes.

Look, they have those
hallway trash chutes.

That's probably how he'll get
rid of your faceless body!

You're right. I'm fine. Go.

Caroline's second job. So proud.

Call me if you freak out or anything.

How am I gonna call you
without a face?

I'm fine. I'm not gonna call you.

Hello, it's caroline,
the professional organizer.

Hello?
Someone called for an organizer?

Hello?

Oh, no. Oh, hell no.

Max, come back!

Hurry up. This is so exciting!

What are you talking about?

I'm not going back in there.

He's a hoarder. A hoarder.

It's a bad reality show.

Hey, that is a great reality show.

but it's not good reality reality.

The only thing I
love more than hoarders

are people who are too
fat to fit through doors.

Tell me the hoarder has
to grease his sides

to get through the door.

You won't have to get
me a birthday present.

Are you kidding me?

They should charge admission for this.

It's hoarders 3d- The experience.

It's like going to an imax.

It's my max!

ooh!

Save yourself. Go on without me.

Oh, god.

What is that pile over there?

It's hard to tell what is what.

It's either a- An old shag carpet

or a mass grave of dead muppets.

No way. Let's get out of here.

We still have our faces.
Why would we leave?

And besides, you need this money.

Look around.

There might be stuff
here they don't want

that we can sell on ebay.

Look. You know someone's
gonna want a fish tank

full of doll heads.

Yeah, someone with a fish
tank full of doll bodies.

Last year I owned a yacht
named the caroliner,

and now I'm considering
selling doll heads on ebay.

I'll be organizing that
thought in a file in my head

labeled "don't open ever."

Okay.

There's a heavy clown
presence in this room.

It's unsettling,
and I'm obsessed with it.

I want both more and less of the clowns.

Um, hello? Anyone here?

Oh, hey, i'm over here.

I'm sorry. Where?

By the papers.

Which papers?

The papers near the papers.

Oh, my god. I love this!

Um, hi. Caroline? We spoke yesterday.

There's a lot more to organize here

than you led me to believe on the phone,

so we're gonna have to
renegotiate our price.

It's not that bad.

Not that bad?

I was hired to organized some papers,

not clean up katrina.

What's he look like?

Please tell me he needs to
be buried in a piano box.

I don't know. I can't
see him through the truck.

It's an rv, and it's a collectible.

It's where I keep my raisins.

So how much more, then?

Um, a hundred a day. For both of us.

And we get to keep the horse
head made out of soda cans.

Why would we want that?

We don't. It's for chestnut.

Every horse wants a
friend made out of cans.

You got a deal.

Okay. We'll get to work then.

Okay. Let's not get overwhelmed.

We'll take it one step at a time.

Let's start small.

Happy birthday to me.

Whoo, max. Well, look at you.

Starting the night at
the end of the night.

This is the first time I've seen you

out of the prison uniform.

You look beautiful.

Oh, earl, let's get married.

What are you staring at?
It's just clothes.

Max, you look like a lady.

Tonight when I dream
of having sex with you,

as always, this time I
will ask you to stay.

Max, you look perfect for your date.

- It's not a date.
- It is.

No, it's not.

It's booty call.

There is a fresh, white billboard.

I'm climbing it with my friend,

and we're putting up his artwork.

Booty call on billboard.

If it's after 2:30,

call is for the dirty.

What's that from?

Dr. Seuss' "oh,
the places you'll put it in"?

Okay, boys, break it up.

Go about your business.
Nothing to see.

Max.

Max and johnny's first date.
So proud.

It's not a date.

Be home at 11:00... a.m.

Uh, max, you got protection?

No, I've got it.

Me too.

Oh, sorry. That is pack of gum.

Can we take these masks off now?

Whoo. It is hot up in that bunny.

Are we wearing these

so no one'll be able to
pick us out of a lineup?

Yeah, that.

And I always wanted to
see a rat with big boobs.

Well, here he is.

All right. Now for the most
crucial part of the art process,

beer break.

That makes sense.

Been here four minutes.

Hmm.

Ooh. Gentleman.

Look over there.
You can see manhattan.

Oh, yeah.

She's a bitch.

Always shoving her stuff in your face.

You can never have it.

Yeah.

I'd never want to live in manhattan.

- 'Cause you can't afford it?
- Yeah.

She is beautiful, though.

Yeah, she is.

Well, we should get back to work.

Bunny's gotta hop.

How many more times
do you need to hear it?

He didn't kiss me.

Maybe it wasn't the right time.

Overlooking the new york skyline,

a hundred feet in the air,
bathed in moonlight?

Yeah, that's a crappy time.

Maybe he didn't want to make a move

because he doesn't know you like him.

I leaned in. I leaned for a kiss.

Maybe you had a breath situation.

What did you eat? What had you eaten?

Nothing.

Okay, but sometimes when
you don't eat, it's worse,

because you start to
grind up your feelings.

Then you get stomach breath.

I wouldn't kiss ryan gosling
with stomach breath.

- Yes, you would.
- Yes, I would.

I'm finally making
progress on the papers.

Oh, no, fdr died of polio.

Oh, look. They cured polio.

Jackpot. This place is
a freakin' cat factory.

And they're alive. How refreshing.

There's, like, 45 kittens in this box,

and I think one of these
kittens just had kittens.

Kittens having kittens.

Hey, douglas, we found some kittens.

Those are not my kittens.

Okay. What about this mountain
of butterfinger wrappers?

those are my wrappers.

I need those.

I haven't even seen him yet.
I love this show.

Douglas, if you're comfortable

with me selling all this
sort-of-valuable stuff on ebay,

why do you need to keep a box
full of butterfinger wrappers?

I don't want to think about it!

See, max?

This is what happens when you
don't deal with your feelings.

You start collecting
butterfinger wrappers,

and next thing you know you're
an old lady in a rest home,

and you're thinking
"why didn't he kiss me?"

why didn't he kiss me?

I don't know.

Why didn't you kiss him?

You obviously like him, right?

Max, stop hoarding your feelings.

Just admit that you like him.

I like him.

Okay, good.

There's one box of
butterfinger wrappers gone.

What?

Douglas, it's a metaphor.

So next time you see him,
why don't you just kiss him?

I don't know if I can kiss him first.

Just kiss him already!

Wait, there's another person in here?

Butt out, ma.

Those are my kittens, young lady.

Hold up. He's hoarding
another hoarder in here?

Awesome.

I can't believe you put

the platypus foot rest in the trash.

On ebay we could get at least
three to six dollars for it.

I'm gonna tell you this one more time.

It's a opossum, and it died at
least three to six years ago.

Oh, my god. There's johnny.

This is a katherine heigl movie.

What are you guys doing
in this neighborhood?

Oh, hello. Sorry to interrupt you,

but what the hell's going on here?

This is, uh...

I'm cassandra, his girlfriend.

Who are you?

I'm max, and, um,
that's how I say hi to everyone.

I'm incredibly friendly.

She's so friendly.

Here's table ten, earl.

Are you okay, max?

Rumor has it that you
had your heart broken.

I didn't have my heart broken.

And that's why I
don't listen to rumors.

Max, I want to announce
I have ended my bromance

with your boyfriend, johnny.

I hate the player as well as the game.

Never was my boyfriend.

I would like to offer
myself for rebound sex.

Or, if not, I can just
beat the crap out of him.

Caroline, did you
have to tell everyone?

I'm sorry, but I'm not
keeping that up in my head.

I'm not going butterfingers.

I can't believe he has a girlfriend.

Are you happy now?

You got me to admit that I like him,

and then you got me to kiss him.

And then I kissed his
beautiful girlfriend,

who is black and british,

the two cool things I can never be.

I'm sorry, but he led you on.

Oh, did he?

I think you and douglas'
mother led me on.

This is not my fault.

He's the one who's hoarding women.

Hi.

Yeah, you must be to come back in here.

Can we talk?

Pick up, max.

Table three, table nine.

Table 69.

Not a good time.

- Max, look...
- Johnny, stop.

You don't need to "max, look" me.

It's cool. You never led me on.

You never put your hands on me.

You never even kissed me.

Food!

Hey, better make sure he
doesn't have a girlfriend

who's beautiful, black, and british.

Max, look, I wanted to kiss you.

I want to kiss you.

I just didn't want to
be the guy who did it

when he's with someone else.

Look, max, I didn't know you
were gonna come into my life.

I didn't know I was gonna
have these feelings for you,

but all of a sudden it's "max"
all the time in my head.

Cassandra and I have or-or had something,

and there is or was love there,

and-and I don't know
what I'm supposed to do

with all my feelings for you.

Johnny, I just spent two days

wading through someone else's garbage,

and, quite frankly,
I don't have the time or the energy

to go through all the
clowns and candy wrappers

you've got going on up in there.

And the next time you invite someone

to a booty call on a billboard...

It wasn't a booty call.

I think everyone knows

if it's after 2:30,
the call is for the dirty.

And p.s., we've known
each other six months,

and you never told me
you had a girlfriend.

You should have worn the rat mask.

And that's all she wrote.

Silver lining time?

We didn't have to change

douglas and his mother's diapers?

We made $240 for the cupcake business

selling all that crap on ebay.

Yup. I made some money,
and all I lost was my mind.

Want to hear something
you don't want to hear?

I think what johnny said
to you was beautiful.

You think a squirrel holding
an acorn is beautiful.

He didn't touch you or kiss you

because he didn't want
to start a relationship

with you out of a lie.

You know what? You're right.

You've been right all along.

It is like romeo and juliet.

And now I'm gonna go
home and kill myself.

I don't think romance
is in the cards for me.

I give guys blue balls,
not broken hearts.

Oh, my god. Don't kill
yourself yet, juliet.

I definitely think
romance is in your cards.

That's not me.

That's not his girlfriend.

Come on, will you at least
admit that that's you

and that he put it up there
because he wanted you to see it?

And that's actually incredibly romantic.

Oh, yeah. That's the
most romantic picture

of a guy who might be kissing someone

who might look like me,

but he didn't because he has
a hot british girlfriend

who seems like kind of a bitch,

but is kind of cooler
than I will ever be.

I dare you to organize that thought.

There's no one cooler than you.

You're 200 feet tall.

Yeah, and a bird
just took a crap on me.

Come on.

Come on.

Hot food from a hot man.

Max, a woman in my section wants to know

if we do anything gluten-free.
What do I tell her?

Tell her she's not allergic to gluten,
she's just masking an eating disorder.

Look alive, people.
Club sandwich, burger medium,

and a shrimp salad
for the gamblin' man.

I asked for salt and pepper.

I wanted
mayonnaise and mustard.

You forgot my diet soda.

Oh, I'm sorry,
I'll be right back with--

Oh, what?

Never doubt me.

Here's my last check, Earl.

Look here, Max. That lady
just slipped me her number.

Like I need another
menopausal white woman

scratchin' at my window
like a cat in heat.

God, I love money.

I know, I'm so sorry
it broke up with you.

Look! This week's new iPad
just came out.

Spread the words.

Word.

Word!

I saw that on The Wire.

Max, three weeks in a row

you have not yet accepted my
request to be a Facebook friend.

Max?
I am talking to you.

Oh, I didn't hear you,
I have my earbuds in.

What are these?

Okay, you had to bust a move,
and get "the truth" on my ass?

Fine, let's go there.
Han,

I'm never gonna be
your Facebook friend.

Oof!
Hard to hear.

Well, I accepted you, Han.

Yes, thank you.
You make my heart sing.

Oof.
Hurt me still.

That was like watching someone
club a baby seal.

Why wouldn't you just say yes
to his friend request?

Because I never
check Facebook, why would I?

So some girl I worked
at a movie theater with in 2005

can tell me it's raining
and she's "totes bummed?"

"Han Lee has tagged you
in 25 photos?"

Want to borrow
my seal club yet?

Oh, that stings. I've lost
like 300 Facebook friends

since my father was arrested.

Well, your father's probably

made that many new friends
in prison,

so it all evens out.

Okay, ready to go?

Do we have to?

It's so hot outside.
When did heat get so hot?

Stop fighting it,
just give in to it.

I don't know why
I'm quoting a rapist.

Can't we just stay
a little bit longer?

We don't have
any A.C. at home.

I have an A.C.
you girls can use.

You have an air conditioner
that works?

Oh, it works.

That's like an A.C. that just had salami.

There's more salami
where that came from.

And my feet hurt.

Well, you gotta stop
wearing those stilts,

and get a pair of Skechers, like
normal broke-ass waitresses.

Skechers?
How dare you.

Besides,
I can't afford new shoes.

These cost $900.

Well, then that's not pain,
that's karma.

Look,
I will help you out, okay?

I know a place we can go

that has designer things
at good prices.

Like a Barney's warehouse?

Kind of.

The Goodwill?

Welcome to my place!

We're shopping at the Goodwill?

You led me to believe
we were real-shopping.

I know.

I couldn't wait to see your face
when you saw this place.

Do the face again.

I love it!

Okay, what's that smell?

It's gonna be your smell
from now on.

Now, pay attention,
I know where the good stuff is.

I know where the good stuff is.

Madison and 57th.

Follow me.

Clever bitches hide stuff
they want to come back and buy,

'cause sometimes they don't have
$3 to buy it at the time.

Who doesn't have $3?

You.

Last week
I hid a dope vintage blazer

in the back of a nightstand,
and here it is!

Six bucks, clever bitch.
Bang, bang!

All right, well, we're here.
I'm gonna make the best of it,

but first I need a basket
without a sno-cone in it.

Hey, Trish.

Not for day-to-day,
but at the country club.

You're kidding,
but you're right.

Hey, when you find something,
check the pockets for pills.

At a thrift store downtown
I found a purple one once,

and took it.
Fell asleep for eight hours.

That was my vacation that year.

Yay, shoes!

Oh, I can't believe I just said,
"yay," in Goodwill.

Look, don't freak.
Shoes can be funky,

but I have a special spray at
home that makes them like new.

Did you get it from a wizard?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God,
these Brian Atwoods were mine.

I donated these to charity,

'cause I was photographed
wearing them twice.

Okay, they were $800
when I bought them,

now they're $8?

Like me. I'm $8.

Oh, my God.

I'm $8.

I've been reduced.

I'm sorry, it just
all became so real to me.

I mean, I can't believe it.

Um, didn't you see me crying?

Lots of people cry at Goodwill.

You go to France,
you eat snails.

You come here, you cry.

That's odd,
you didn't even react.

You need to react
when people cry.

I did, I rolled my eyes.

Look, eventually, you'll learn
to do that on the inside.

Okay, well, just FYI,

when I used to cry in front of
my other girlfriends,

they'd be like,
"What you cryin' about, C-line?

"Look at you, girl,
you're fierce,

you got your glam on."

Are your girlfriends
black drag queens?

Oh, awesome strokes tee.

I went to this concert,
but I couldn't afford the shirt.

Oh, we're done with me.

I went to see them on this tour

the summer after my junior year.
It was a really warm night,

and I snuck out of the house,
and we all ma--

Ahem.
Whatever.

And what?

What, did something great happen
the night you got the t?

Look at me, does it look like
something great ever happens?

Hey, cute tee.

Had my eye on it.

I was just
bringin' my girl back to see it.

She was in the bathroom.

I had to throw up.

So hand it over.

You know the rule.

Turn the back on the rack,
you're under attack.

That's not me,
that's the law of the 'Will.

Yeah,
you better walk away.

That was intense.

Ah, just another Wednesday
at the 'Will.

You said to look in things,
right?

Max, look.
On my first try!

Ooh, slick. Whoever
hid those is gonna be pissed.

Quality check.

Fabric sturdy,
no mysterious crotch stains,

nice work, Nancy Drew.

And look, they're designer.

Summer 2009. $350.

And for me today...

$5.
That's a reduction I like.

$5!
Oh!

$5, $5, $5, $5...

$5, $5...

Hi, Maria.

How are you, Max?

I'm good, how's your mom doin'?

Good. She really appreciated
the cupcakes you made her.

Hi, Maria, I'm Caroline,
Max's friend.

Any way we can get
the price down a bit for these?

I think $8 is steep,
considering their condition.

I happen to know
the heel has been replaced.

I cannot believe
you're trying to shoe her down.

I can do $6.

Deal.

Oh, you happy?

You haggled a charity.

You're turning Goodwill
into bad will.

My t-shirt's gone.

It's not here.

I bet it was that
Puerto Rican girl,

who was--
who was eyeing it.

Maria, can we call security?

I'm sure one of the cameras
must have captured the theft.

Cameras? What do you think
this is, target?

It's gone, Caroline.

She must have stolen it

while I was watching you
do your stupid $5 dance.

I didn't turn my back on
the rack, why am I under attack?

See, this is why I shop alone,
this is why I eat alone,

this is why I'm leaving alone.

Maria, I'll pay for these.

You don't have to box them,
you can just use tissue paper.

Even as I'm saying this,
I know it's not gonna happen.

Chestnut...

Hot as a mother, right?

Better, right?

Hey, Johnny.

I thought I told you

to keep your dumb, tragic ass
out of here.

The only thing that
isn't tragic about me is my ass.

And who's
the blonde, bony skank?

Oh, dude, she's not in on this.

Oh, I'm so sorry, miss.

Hey, I'm Johnny,
I'm Max's friend.

I'm Caroline.
I'm freaked out.

This is something we do.

- To remind us of our families.
- Mm-hmm.

Excuse me for a second.
These guys tip more

if I high-five 'em
when we talk about chicks.

Vagina!

Yeah!

Wow. Girl,
your bartender friend is cute.

Look at those arms.
Nice guns.

He's not just a bartender,
this dude is legit.

He's a street artist,
goes by "Jpeg."

Hmm.
Well, right now

he's cutting up limes
and cleaning glasses.

Well, you're an heiress

who's slinging burnt hash
and stale toast.

Touche.

Douch-ay.

These are from the gentleman
with a sweet note,

"Nice ass, nice rack."

Whoo!

Hoo.

If that's your tequila noise,

God knows
what your orgasm sounds like.

Same face, no sound.

Oh, my God.

I can't believe it,
it's the girl from the 'Will.

I got your back, gir-r-r.

What is she doin'?

She thinks Goodwill
has made her tough.

Um, hi.
How are you?

I just wanted to talk to you

about that shirt
at the Goodwill.

See, my friend really wanted it,
and, well, your friend has it.

What are you sayin', bitch?

Okay, I think we might have
got off on the wrong foot.

Do you want to feel my foot,
bitch?

Well, I guess we know
what your favorite word is.

Ow!

Those are not extensions,
bitch!

Oh!

I should break this up,
I should break this up.

No, no, no, give her like four
seconds to learn her lesson.

Oh, okay, ow!
All right. All right!

- Okay, okay, okay.
- Ow! Oh, oh.

Okay, come on, come on.

- Oh!
- It's okay.

Those are not extensions,
bitch!

Are you still laughing,
'cause it wasn't funny.

It was so funny.
It was like looney tunes funny.

It was like Bugs Bunny
getting shot in the face funny.

Only in your version,

Bugs Bunny tries to have
a dialogue with the shotgun.

I was trying

to get your t-shirt back.

I wanted you to have it,

because you lit up at the 'Will
when you saw it.

I do not light up, okay?

There's no light inside me.

What you're seeing
is probably radiation

from the summer
I collected uranium tubes

by the train tracks.
That was good money.

Thanks for looking out for me,
Caroline.

You're welcome, Max.

It's a t-shirt,
it's gone.

I don't get attached to things.

Ow. My nail practically
got torn off back there

by "Cat Von D-Minus."

I'm gonna have to
sleep with it elevated.

Is there a nail place
around here?

Well, this is New York,

so there's probably
gonna be one right...

here.
Love when that happens.

Look, a two-for-one
girlfriend special. Genius.

Go with me tomorrow before work,
it'll be cheaper if we both go.

I really need one.

Plus, you need one, too.

Well, I can't. I have my own
day of luxury already booked.

I'm doing a laundry, and then
the tasting menu at Wendy's.

Come on. You and me, nails,
and air conditioning.

It'll be fun.

You're doin' it,
gir-r-rl.

Me and my friends
used to love getting manicures.

'Cause they're black drag queens?

Oh.

Hey, dude.

It's about that time?

Let me get the pooper scooper.

All right.
Let's do this.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Let me ask you something.
How is it that you,

a horse, and Caroline
are both living with me,

and you're
less of a problem for me?

I mean, you tell me,
you've known her longer.

She picks a fight
with a tatted-out white chick

from the Bronx?
What is up with that?

I don't know, man,
I'm just used to it.

That's what you'd sound like,
if you talked.

I agree with you,
by the way.

Everything you say is right,
Max.

Thank you, Chestnut.

You should kill her.

Chestnut!
I can't do that.

It'll be easy.
We could kill her and eat her.

Chestnut!

All right, buddy,
here's your spot.

Come on, do your business.

Come on, Ches.

Buh-buh-buh buh-buh.

Buh-buh-buh buh-boo.
Come on.

Come on!

Come on, Chestnut,
I got a lot of crap to do today.

And so do you.

Jeez, don't be shy, buddy...

I hope you're happy. I look
like a Cambodian stripper.

Um, they prefer to be called
"ping pong ball artists."

These cost $70.43.

She forced me to get tips,
and then tip her for the tips.

See, and all because
you never showed up,

I didn't get
the two-for-one discount,

because I was waiting alone,
for you.

Max, I have really tried
to be girlfriends with you,

but you obviously
have some issues.

Follow me to the walk-in.

Good, let's get it out.

Here.

I thought we were gonna talk.

No, we just didn't have
any chocolate cream in the case.

Why didn't you show up?

You told me
you were gonna be there.

Well,
I had a lot of crap to do.

Well, you gave me
the impression you were going.

I gave you the impression?
I don't do impressions.

Well, wait, that's not true,
I do one, my mom.

But to do that.
I need a Christmas tree,

a gallon of vodka,
and a lit cigarette.

So are we
gonna be girlfriends or not?

Look, I'm gonna
give this to you straight up.

I am never gonna be the type
of girlfriend you're used to.

I am not your gir-r-r,
or your gir-r-rl,

and I am definitely not

someone's two-for-one girlfriend
crap at a nail store.

In fact, think of me as a dude.

So-o-o,
are we good?

Yeah. We good.

I get it.
You're not a girl's girl.

Okay, good.

I can be a girl's girl.

Oh, Caroline,

please do not take
advantage of me with your horse.

What?

My trash pick up company
charged me extra,

because my dumpster is full
of all your horse droppings.

How would that be possible?

I see your good friend, Max,
walking your horse every morning

and dropping droppings
in my dumpster.

Hi.

Hello.

Did you walk my horse today?

Yeah, and every other morning.

That's so sweet.
I wish I had known.

Well, what was I gonna do,
post it on your Facebook wall?

"Ha, walked a horse again today.
Totes gross."

Besides, who did you think
was doing it?

I've always just
had things done for me,

I've never really thought about
the people doing them.

Yeah, and I've never had
things done for me,

so I just do them.

Like now,
how I'm making the coffee,

and you're just standing here
watching me.

Still,
I wish you would have told me,

so I could say thank you.

Well, it's not really my style.

You are one complicated dude.

Pick up, borscht.

- Unbelievable.
- What?

Hey.
How you guys doin'?

Cute strokes tee.

Probably look better on me,
considering it's mine.

You snooze, you lose, puta.

Nice language!

You kiss your obviously closeted
boyfriend with that mouth?

You know what?
I wouldn't even want it now.

Now that it's been on you,

might as well have been
a Kenny G shirt.

And now I walk.

You can't just let her win.

Oh, forget it, it's over.

Borscht!
Pick up, pick up.

Hi, I'll be right with you.

Oh!

- Idiota!
- Oh.

Esta camiseta
me costo cuatro dolares!

Te voy a cortar.

Lo siento.
Todo es mi culpa.

I'm still a little clumsy,
it's my first week.

I'll bring you some soda water,
but seriously,

your boyfriend will come out
before that borscht stain does.

That was awesome.

Yeah.
I kinda just do stuff.

Like I just did, while you were
standing there watching me.

Thanks, gir-r-rlfriend.

Oh.

What, is she coming for me?

Run.

Fresh warm cupcakes!

Enjoy this winter wonderland
with some hot, hot cocoa!

Why are we open and selling
to no one,

when we should be closed
and taking a floor nap?

Yes, Max, it's a blizzard right now,
but in an hour, it could be 65!

That's the beauty
of global warming.

You, stop!

I'll give you
a peppermint stick!

That is a straw
with red stripes.

Well, what sounds better, Max,
a peppermint stick or...

"A straw with red stripes"?

First of all,
great impression of me.

And second, no one in their right mind
is stopping for cupcakes right now.

Oh, hey, girls!
Guess who wants a cupcake.

It's me.

Here you go, Sophie.
See, Max, we have a customer.

And just so you know,
I'm not gonna pay.

Oh, I'm so glad you stayed open,
even with all this snow everywhere.

You know, good for you.

You two are really committed
to this little cupcake window,

even when it's stupid.

That's it,
we're closing.

These streets need to be plowed more
than that poor married Jonas brother.

No, wait. Listen!
It's the snowplow.

Now, people will be able
to get to us.

I told you, it is gonna be one of those
magical New York City nights.

Do it again!

Season 3, Episode 13
"And the Big But"

Synced by P2Pfiend & Reef


Why are we here?

It's still snowing,
and we have no customers.

I had to put money in the cash
register just to steal it.

We can't just leave.
Han's not here.

Maybe the trains aren't running,
or Han got knocked out by a snowflake.

Well, you know the diner rule,
the one I just made up.

If he's 30 minutes late, we grab whatevev
we can fit in our pockets and leave.

Of course, if he's 31 minutes late and
there's no one here, we all get fired.

But I say
we roll the dice.

Well, whatever happened, we can't
run the diner if Han's not here.

That's right, who's gonna walk around
here guessing what a vagina looks like?

Uh, me?

Pick up.

I like this cold weather.
I get to wear my chin-cheetah hat.

Chin-cheetah...?
That's not even a real animal.

Yes, it is.
This was the last one.

Who's that food for?
We don't have any customers.

It's for me and Deke. We're studying
pastry school stuff in the cupcake shop.

We're also putting rocks
in snowballs and throwing them

at hipsters wearing those stupid
stuffed animal hats.

Max, you think
school will be open?

I was hoping it'd be closed,
so I'd have at least have one day

where I wouldn't have to deal with
the drama between me and Chef Nicolas.

Oh, is that the married man
you kissed?

- Who told you?
- You! Like a hundred times.

Ooh!
Let's play a snow day game.

Like what, guess the code
to the safe in Han's office?

I know the first two numbers
are eight and nine.

How about...
if you could have sex

with anyone here,
who would it be?

"Could have"
or "forced to have"?

Oleg, you go first.

- I pick Caroline.
- Oh, thank you. That's gross.

No, Caroline got mauled
by a bear in the snow.

I did?

No, it was me
in a bear costume.

She never saw me coming.

So my only two choices
are you or Earl?

No, Earl passed away
in his sleep.

Of course,
you'll feel terrible

when that happens
in a couple of weeks.

Now, if you'd excuse me, I'm going
to go home and roll me a fatty.

Her name is Denise.

Okay, so I pick you.

Me?

You pick me
out of all these two people?

- Luis, are you blushing?
- No! I'm wearing blush.

Don't worry, everyone!
I survived!

Still don't know where Han is,
but the new Bond villain just arrived.

Now there's an even bigger
Octopussy in town.

I'm very sorry I'm late.

I got stuck in a snow bank,
and I had to pee myself out.

Where's Max? And I know
shs's not trapped in the storm,

'cause she's the one who
taught me how to pee my way out.

Max, what is the French name
for this pastry

that looks like
a bunch of glazed balls?

A sha-sha-sha?

No.

A doh-doh-doh-doh-doh?

Oh, so close.
It's a "pata-choo."

French and chemistry
for pastry school?

I thought class was gonna be like,
"Which is better, cake or bread?"

"They're both great, duh.
Here's your degree."

I have terrible news.

Han's not dead, and he wants us
to do side work.

Do you mind?
Harry Pothead and I are trying to study.

Oh, Max,
I know how we'll pass.

We can ask that girl next to us
in class for help.

She speaks French. You know,
the one with the bubble butt, Judy?

Oh, yeah!
Judy with the booty.

You don't know her
that well.

Please, call her
"Judith with the boodith."

Max, can I interrupt
this episode of "Ass Chat"

and talk to you outside
for a second?

- Sure.
- Hey, Max.

Her butt's so big, she walks
into the room doggie-style.

Like I said to my uncle when he came into
my bedroom in the middle of the night,

"This better be good."

Does it bother you when Deke talks about
other girls with you like you're a guy?

Not as much as it bothers me
when you talk to me like I'm a girl.

Look, Deke and I are just bros.
I don't want to sleep with him.

Not that there's anything wrong
with two bros sleeping together.

I'm not bromophobic.

It's just not what this is.

So you're sure there's nothing sexual
going on between you and him?

Yes, I'm sure.

No!

Watch, I'm gonna take
a snow swim.

Not that cold.

You're right, nothing sexual there,
unless you like adult men in underoos.

Well, there's Nicolas.
I was not prepared for this.

Really? 'Cause we spent the entire
subway ride preparing you for this.

Okay, look, should I brace myself
for weirdness between you two?

And by that,
I mean should I hit this?

No, I'm cool.
Cool as a cucumber.

LL Cool J.
Never been cooler.

Ugh! Why didn't I drink
before you said that?

Oh, yeah.
I am gonna ice him out.

Well, maybe lose
a couple of those cubes,

because he is your boss,
and the only reason

I can afford to go here
is 'cause you work in the office.

- Don't worry, he'll never know.
- Pretend you're Nicolas.

Hello, Caroline.

I am a man,
but I am pretty like a lady.

- Good morning, how are you?
- Ooh, that was good.

'Sup, Max? Look who
I got to ride up with.

- Hey, Max.
- Hey, Jude.

- You ever heard that one before?
- Yeah. Is that, like, a thing?

Thanks for the ride up,
Deke.

Caroline.

I bet we were gonna have
to take the freight elevator.

Really? I assumed you guys
would take the ass-calator.

- Oh, hello, Caroline.
- Good morning, how are you?

- Very well, thank you.
- Can't you see I'm mad at you?

- Then why are you smiling?
- This is my fake face.

Then what does
your real face look like?

How dare you kiss me
when you're married?

I prefer the fake one.

- Bonjour, class.
- Bonjour, Chef Nicolas.

Today, we will be concentrating
on the chemistry of baking,

for tomorrow's test.

I don't know about the damn test, but
I would ace a pop quiz on that ass.

- Oh, sorry.
- I'll get that.

Let Judy pick it up.
It's a chance to see it in motion.

You think she got that thing
at a Kim Kardashian backyard sale?

When you add water to the flour
to hydrate the two proteins,

glutenin and gliadin,
those two proteins

are drawn to each other,
and they bond.

Like I like to say,
they're hot for each other.

Max, look, they were drawn
to each other, they bonded,

and now, we've got
our own big butt.

Dat ass, though!

More like dat ass dough.

You need to wet the dough with
water to keep it moist and supple.

Wet your bread, everyone,
wet your bread.

Mine's pretty wet.
How's yours?

Mine would be,
but it's on antidepressants.

Work with your partner,
help each other out.

- Here, let me help, Max.
- Yeah, mine's not as smooth as yours.

Mm, keep kneing it.
You need more water.

It's better, right?

Yeah, I think
wetting it helped.

Caroline, something
is really wrong with me.

Don't freak out. I'm here for you.
Unless it's something I can catch.

Something weird happened.
I think I might have feelings for Deke.

Oh, God, no!

I mean, that is interesting.
Let's talk about that.

I don't know what to do.

We're bros, and I don't want to ruin the
friendship, which is really unlike me.

I always ruin friendships. I've been
trying to ruin ours since you moved in.

Well, what changed
with Deke?

It was so weird...
he was wetting my bread,

and then my bread was wet,
if you know what I'm saying.

Okay, thank you.
I'm finally off bread.

Look, I understand.

You can't always help
who you're attracted to.

It's like with me
and Nicolas...

This is not the same
as you and Frenchie.

I wasn't attracted to Deke
before today.

The first time
you met Nicolas,

your vagina fell on the floor
and tried to crawl up his leg.

Yes, but I scooped it up
and snapped it back on

because I was not born
to have sex with a married man.

If I was, I would have flirted
with Matt Lauer

when he came over for the Christmas
tree lighting at my house.

Matt Lauer...
that guy's got game.

No hair, but game.

Hey, everybody,
good news!

Oh, I passed that kidney stone.
Yeah, I think the skiing loosened it.

Oh, I felt like I was birthing
a baby through my eye hole.

Did you save the stone?

'Cause only three more, and you
can make me that necklace.

Max, don't change the subject.
What are you gonna do about Deke?

Oh, wait, I love giving advice.
I had my own advice column in Poland.

It was called
"Don't Do That!"

Sophie, have you ever
had sex with a friend?

Oh, no.
Are you two gonna do it?

- No, that is not what...
- Oh, don't do that!

No, it will ruin your relationship
and my opinion of Max.

What about your opinion
of me?

Eh, it's already
pretty low.

What am I gonna do about Deke?
He's coming over to study tonight.

Oh, God, I sound like
such a girl from the '50s...

Gonna go cry
into my princess phone.

You should tell Deke
how you feel,

and tell him tonight, because
I think that Judy girl likes him,

and I think
he might like her too.

Why do you say that?
I literally don't care at all,

but I just want to know,
why would you say that?

Max, he likes big butts,
and he cannot lie.

"At what temperature
does sugar crystallize?"

"Fahrenheit and Celsius."
Go, Max.

Max.

Why are you looking at me
like that?

- This doesn't make any sense!
- Well, your book is upside down.

Hey, hearing a lot
of chitchat in here.

Just wanted to make sure
you two are studying.

Stop studying. Kiss him.

All right, well,
I better be going.

- Just pretend I'm not here.
- I always do.

Hey, um, this is weird,
but before we study,

I kind of have something
to tell you.

Weird, 'cause I kinda
have something to tell you.

That is weird.
Maybe it's the same thing.

Someone wants to have sex
with me.

How did you know that?

'Cause Judy with the booty
just texted me,

"Would you like to study tonight
and then have sex with me?"

I think you've interpreted that
correctly.

Wow, she's direct
and, I might add, slutty.

I know, she's got balls
to go with that butt.

So what were you
gonna tell me?

Oh, I was going to tell you
what you just told me,

that Judy with the booty
wants to have sex with you.

Glad she got up the guts to tell you.
So go for it.

Wait, you want me
to go for it?

Yeah, totally, go for it.
She seems kind of clean, go get it.

But we're supposed to study.

I wouldn't want to bail on you
just to go hit that.

Hey, if you don't,
I will.

You're really gonna
pass that ass up?

Now get going,
'cause I have to memorize

what temperature cho-cho-cho
turns into chan-chan-chan.

- So you're telling me to go?
- I'm saying, "Ta-ta-ta."

Go get her bread wet.
Make it rise, bro.

Okay, then, bro.

I guess I will go,
but with that butt,

if I come back a crack addict,
it's your fault.

Where's he going?
Is this a condom run?

Is he going
on a condom run?

'Cause if he is, can you
text him to pick up a diet Coke?

Can, not a bottle.
You know the deal.

He's going to have sex with Judy.
You were right, he's into her.

I'm so glad I didn't say anything.
That would have felt terrible.

- How do you feel now?
- Terrible.

But at least
I didn't embarrass myself.

I was this close
to showing him my gnomes.

Wow, you must
really like him

if you were willing to let him know
that you're an insane person.

Well, I'm about to be
more screwed than Judy,

because I didn't study
at all.

I know French.
I can help you.

You can help me with the keys
you have to Nicolas' office.

We are breaking in
and stealing the test!

Why are you covering his ears?
He knows you steal.

You took him
from someone's yard.

I can't believe we're sneaking
into his office to steal your test.

This is cheating.

Oh, don't worry, I hear
my teacher's kind of into cheating.

Can't argue with that.

Max, please hurry.
Find the test,

and let's get out of here
because we shouldn't be in here

and it smells like him
and I like it.

Okay, one of these papers
has to be it.

Oh, no, everything's written
in secret code!

Max, that's French.

How is it possible he's even better-
looking in photos than in real life?

Max, hurry up.
I can't be around his stuff.

My vagina's trying
to get out of my pants again.

Well, get her out here!

Maybe shshcan help me look
for the test, 'cause you're useless.

Oh, no, it's Nicolas. I can smell him
in the hall, and I like it.

Max, let's get out of here.

Okay, well, you have to stay and
distract him, so I can sneak out.

Just pretend you're not mad
and you came in to see him.

I can't just turn it on
like that.

What am I, an actress
at a cocktail party?

You have to, it's the only logical
explanation you have for being in here.

Caroline.

I've missed you.
I'm in your office.

That's the only logical explanation
I have for being in here.

- Oh, sorry. Did I hurt you?
- Oh, no, I'm sitting on something.

Oh, sorry. Oh, those are
the exams for today.

Oh, well, let me just give us some room
while I push these exams on the floor.

Now, kiss me again,
but this time, lay on top of me,

so your legs are out of the way.
Now, go!

Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

You know this can't happen.
You're married.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go snap something back on.

Well, here are
the test answers,

but I don't know what the questions
are, because I only got half the test,

and I'm only half sure
those are the answers.

- Whoa, dude, how did you get this?
- I turned Caroline into a whore.

Can you figure out
any of this?

I don't have any idea
what these questions could be.

Ugh!
I didn't study either.

Judy and I got to talk,
and it got pretty involved.

Well, now we're screwed.
I mean, you already got screwed.

Congrats.
Proud of you, bro.

Max, we're gonna flunk
this test.

Better go to the men's room and
write all the answers on my penis.

Don't worry,
they'll fit.

I hope you're happy, I've now
kissed a married man twice.

Oh, and here, I grabbed this
from Nicolas' office.

That's not the test.
It's a phone bill.

I know, I wanted you to see
he doesn't call his wife much.

Fire!
Everyone get out!

Move your big ass!
We're gonna burn! Scoot.

Oh, my God, Max!
I hope Nicolas is okay!

Don't worry about me,
I'm right behind you!

Caroline, I want you to be safe.
Come with me.

You're married.
I'll just stay here and burn.

Caroline, don't be crazy.

This is all your fault.

Don't worry about me,
I'm right behind you!

Max, wait.

It's just a false alarm.
I pulled it.

So classy.

You weren't gonna pass that test,
and I need you in that class with me.

You did this for me?

Yeah, and for me too,
I wasn't gonna pass either.

But, look, when you were talking
about me and Judy just now,

you seemed kind of weird,
and...

Oh, hey, I just had
a weird moment yesterday

when you were getting my dough
wet and I kinda got turned on,

sort of thought I liked you.
Yeah, gross, right?

Oh, right, yeah.
Totally gross.

Anyway, dude,
we're just bros.

Okay, bro,
but just so you know,

nothing happened
between me and Judy last night.

That's lame... if you like a girl,
you should just grab her and kiss her.

Okay.

- Was that weird?
- Yeah. And I liked it.

Max, come on!
Oh.

Sorry to interrupt, but
we're supposed to evacuate the building.

There's no fire.
Deke pulled the alarm.

I wanted to kiss her.

Yeah.
Turns out he's into dudes.

I'm Max.
I'll be your waitress,

'cause they don't do
background checks here.

Oh, you'll
be our waitress.

I never guessed
that based on the uniform

and name tag
that says "Max."

You know I make,
like, $3, right?

I realize that's a lot
of money in the 1920s

where you two are from.

Here, open this
and bring us two clean glasses.

Sure, not-so-great gatsby.

Hey, oj and Nicole.

Rude snobs at table ten.
You know what that means.

Wine swap?
- Let's roll.

Hey, Oleg,
I need one of those $2 merlots

you get from your cousin
with the hole in his neck.

Caroline, price check.

Oh! Chateau pavie, 2008.
Very expensive.

But, hey,
we deserve it.

Here, better
let it breathe.

It was in my gym bag.

Not a problem.

This vintage pairs well
with jockstrap.

Do you think waitresses
did this to me when I had money?

Only if you had
an attitude.

(Both)
So that's a yes.

I can't remember
if this reminds me

of an old heist movie I saw
on an old heist

I actually participated in.

I know.
We're like ocean's 7/11.

All we're missing
is a tiny Asian guy

who can fit
into small boxes.

Hello.

Table ten is looking
for their wine.

Oh, not a problem.
Coming right up.

What did you do?
Why is she smiling?

Are my pants on fire again?

(peter bjorn and John)
¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ¶

[metal clanks, mouse squeaks]

Oh, yeah,
take that, sucker!

[Mouse squeaking]
Max, when I said

we need to move
the cupcakes,

I didn't mean through the air
at a rodent's head.

Hey, he ran up the window,

so it's kind of
a stand-your-ground situation.

[Metal clanks, mouse squeaks]

Okay, we're on a time-out.
He's eating my ammo.

Max, business
is down again,

and the only phrase
I've said more than that is,

"please, god,
take me in my sleep."

I mean, it's clear.
Not getting ahead.

Oh, is that what
your mood is about?

You're not getting
any ahead?

'Cause I can take care
of that with one call.

You are not hooking me up
with that guy

who's listed in your phone
as "oral redenbacher."

Max, this
is our future.

We need to get serious
about making money.

Absolutely.
Let's leave early.

Leave early?
Who are we, congress?

Do you think other
business got successful

by leaving early?

No, they did it
by hiring illegals

and moving their
bank accounts offshore.

We can't leave early.

The sign says
"open till 2:00 A.M."

Well, I'm open to getting
a new sign that says "closed."

I mean, are we supposed
to just hang around here

and wait for whatever nut jobs
are trolling around town?

Hi, girls.

Guess what Oleg and I
are going to do

that will probably
give me hep c.

A three way
with Tommy Lee?

No, silly.
We're getting matching tattoos.

We want something that
represents our relationship.

So maybe two butterflies
doing the nasty

during "CSI: Miami."

Wow, you two,
his and her tats.

Romantic and will help
identify the bodies.

Sure, you know,
matching tattoos

are the deepest expression
of commitment.

Well, matching tattoos

and pooping in front
of each other.

I'm not gonna do it
in front of my man.

I poop at McDonald's
'cause I'm a lady.

Thanks for the cupcake.

We really have
to start charging her.

Charge her with what,
first-degree man-settling?

Max, as I was saying,
it's time to get serious

about the business.

Absolutely.
Let's leave early.

What? Last night
after 1:00,

we made
only $15, right?

$14.63.

What? Math is
my thing.

Would you roll your eyes
if you were standing

across from eminem
and he started rapping?

Uh, yes.

I'd be all, "dude, you're 60.
Sit on a porch swing."

Okay, look,
here is $15.

That'll cover
what we'll probably make.

I'm leaving.

You're just gonna
leave me here?

Yup, I'm leaving as soon
as I get my change back

from that $14.63.

Fine, just tell me
how much that is.

Or maybe sooner.

This is a very
big day for me.

Why, because of this
totally out-of-the-blue order

we got to do cupcakes
for this business seminar?

No, the first time
I've entered a Sheridan

through a door.

Usually it's by window
or freight elevator.

And one time, I rolled in
under some girl's

quinceañera dress.

The seminar's
about to start.

I have unclaimed name tags
for Pamela, Ellen...

What kind of losers
would come to this?

Max, Caroline.

I wouldn't
call us losers.

Are you here?

Okay, so there
is no cupcake order.

I signed us up
for this seminar.

I carried cupcakes
on a subway for nothing?

The annoying woman next
to me talked the whole time.

I was sitting
next to you, Max.

Look, I knew you wouldn't
come otherwise,

and you need to be here.

This is a business
intervention.

It's not an intervention.

Max, your behavior lately
has affected me

in the following ways.

I can't believe this.

At least in my other
interventions I was drunk.

We need
to do this seminar.

Gordon kepper
is a genius.

He's gonna give our business
a real bump.

Guys giving me a bump
is why they threw me

that second
intervention.

Let's go.

Oh, mm, okay.
See you.

So this is
your new thing, Max?

You're just
gonna walk out on me?

Actually, it's
an old thing.

In fact, it's kind
of a family tradition.

I learned from my father,
whoever he is.

Come on.
It's just two days.

Two days?
No way.

No freaking way.

There's a buffet
and a dessert bar.

Ooh, okay.

Wait here, I'll go pay.
I brought some cash.

And they'll take an expired
target gift card, right?

Oh, we are
not paying.

Here.
Here, Pamela.

Follow Ellen
to the freight elevator.

No way, Max.
We are not sneaking in.

How much
is this thing?
- $1,000.

We're sneaking
in, Ellen.

Now, you all
are here today

not only to find out
what you are as a business

but to find out
who you are.

I'm a lady hoping
there's macaroni and cheese

at that buffet.

Who are you
is your brand,

and saying that a brand
is simply a name

is like saying Abraham Lincoln
is simply a name,

or mahatma Gandhi, god.

Who does this guy
think he is?

I'm sure you're wondering,
"who does this guy think he is?"

Okay, that was weird.

Or maybe
this seems weird.

I've got chills.

When it comes to business,

people come up to me
all the time.

They say,
"Gordon, business is hard,

but I do what I can."

And they shrug.
Now, is that the right attitude?

(All)
No.
- Yes.

To those people,
I say, "don't do what you can.

Can what you do."

don't do what you can.

Can what you do!
Get it?

Do you get it?

(All)
Yes.
- No.

You did not get it.
Shh.

All right, everybody,
reach under your chairs

and pick up
what you find there.

Hope it's a way
out of here.

Koosh balls?

Inside those cans,
you will find the key

to success
in your business.

Not unless the key
is Rosie O'Donnell's career

before her buzz cut.

Truth.

That's the big secret
to business.

If people buy
what you're saying,

they will buy
what you're selling.

Max, stay alert.
This could go to cult like that.

I like to think of those things
you're holding

as my truth balls.

Screw this.
Let's get to the meatballs.

Anytime in the next
two days,

one of you is up here
selling you something

that you feel is just bull,

then toss it--

Max!

I mean, Ellen!

Yeah, baby.

That is what
I'm talking about.

Whoever threw that
is not afraid

to really go for it,

and that will go
a long way

toward success
in business.

All right, cool, but it is
a long way to the buffet?

'Cause I am starving.

Okay, everyone.

Consider these small groups
you've broken into

as little think tanks.

I need you to work together
and bring out your very best.

[Snores]

Max!

don't blame me.

Blame the heavy cream
at the fettuccini bar.

Alfredo must be Italian
for "roofie."

So, Ellen,
tell us what you have,

and I'll tell you
what we think.

Oh, Ellen.
That's you.

Oh, oh, yes, yes,
that's me.

I'm Ellen.
Definitely an Ellen.

See, I dance.

Okay.

Okay.
Okay, now it's weird.

So, Ellen...

Let's hear your b.B.B.--

your brilliant
business brand.

Uh...

[Chuckles]

[Stammers]

I-I don't do the talking.
Pamela does the talking.

Pam?
- Thanks, Ellen.

Hello, everyone,
my name is Pam panning,

and what my partner, Ellen,
was trying to say is,

we making very beautiful
artisan cupcakes.

Yeah, but they're
still cool.

I never said
they weren't cool.

Yeah, mm, maybe they just
didn't sound cool

coming out of your face.

I'm sorry,
but at least actual words

are better than,
"uh, uh-uh, uh..."

Ladies, hold.

Sometimes in business

parents' ships will sail
in two different directions,

so you two need to find out
if you're gonna continue

to sail apart
or if you're gonna change course

and reconvene at the port
of mutual understanding.

Well, we can't sail
too far apart

'cause I'm definitely
gonna have to explain

what you just said to her.

I got it.

I'm a boat, and I'm trying
to get away from you.

Sounds right to me.

Think it over.

Talk it over
with your first mate.

[Snickers]

Come back tomorrow

and tell me
who your business is,

and I'll help guide you
toward that purpose.

And remember,
you can't purpose without--

puss.
- Okay, wow.

Gordon, her boat's kind
of in shallow water right now,

but we're gonna go away,
get it together,

and come back
and blow you away.

And you can't spell
"blow you away" without--

our ship's leaving.

Oh, hello.

Welcome to
the williamsburg diner.

Can I get you anything,
like a work ethic?

Han, this is adorable,
but we're busy.

We're pitching
our business brand tomorrow,

and Max and I need to get
on the same page.

Yeah, we don't want
to work here

the rest of our lives.

Well, now we're all
on the same page.

Han, just give us
ten minutes.

Then we'll get to work.

Well, I've waited
four years.

What's another
ten minutes?

Max, I have to say
I was a little thrown

by that thing
you said today.

What, that the best sex
I've ever had

was alone
on the tilt-a-whirl?

No, why would that throw me?
You say that every day.

No, that thing about me
not sounding cool.

Why would that throw you?
I say it every day.

Yes, but not about
the business.

So what was it?
The word "artisan"?

Okay, first of all,
it sounds like fart-isan,

as in, "a fart is
in this room right now."

Somebody finally
called you out on it, Caroline.

So I was thinking
our slogan could be,

"Max's homemade cupcakes.
Sugar and spice."

I'd rather go
with fart-isan.

Really, beavis?

What does your business partner
butthead think?

Our business
isn't working.

Well, guess who
is working.

Me, the damn owner.

Why are you surprised?

You know how many cupcakes
were not selling.

I mean, you're secretly
eating at least six a night

to make me think
we're selling more.

Also 'cause I'm sad.

Look, I know you went
to wharton and all, but--

wait...

What's happening?

Is this a business
intervention on me?

From someone
who pronounces

the word business
"bidness"?

Why are you giving me
the big eye-painting face?

You knew the business
wasn't working.

Well, I don't hear you
coming up with any ideas.

That's 'cause
you don't listen.

Remember when I said
we should stop making

all these flowery cupcakes

and just make ones
that say mean things

like "eat it"
and "lick me"?

Your big business plan
is cupcakes

that say "eat it"
and "lick me"?

And other funny things
like "loser"

or "eat your feelings."

Hmm, why not just shoot people
in the face

when they come
to the window?

And I thought the back
of our t-shirt

could just say,
"cream filled."

So funny if, like,
a hot girl was wearing it.

And even funnier
if it was a fat guy.

Okay, maybe like
Gordon said,

our partner ships are going
in different directions.

My sugar and spice ship
is going one way,

and your mean
and ugly booze cruise

is going another.

So how about tomorrow,
I'll sail my ship,

and you can
sail yours, Ellen.

Done.

And, Pam, I know
you think your ship don't sink,

but it does.

So, Hannah, Todd, go.

Tell us,
who is your business?

We make
guitar case suitcases.

Yeah, they're suitcases
that look like guitar cases

so you can look cool
at the airport.

So far,
no truth balls.

That means we believe
you're telling some truth

of who you are.

Business is always--

okay then.

So what,
their big idea

is just throwing your crap
in a guitar case?

Well, it's
no fart-isan cupcake.

Todd, Hannah, did you get
together with our graphic artist

to help create a logo?

Yes, we did.

We stayed up all night,
and to be honest,

it got kind of weird.

That's our logo,

and our company's called
"I'm with the band."

Back off!

She just got
out of rehab.

Business is not
for the faint of heart

or coke addicts.

Next up, we've got
Ellen and Pam.

Let's give 'em
some love.

Max, you're really not
gonna go up there

and sell your idea
as a business plan.

Yup, and I feel
pretty good about it.

Okay, well, then I hope
you enjoy lots of balls

in your face.

If I didn't
at burning man,

I doubt I will here.

Gordon, hi.

As you predicted,

today we'll be presenting
our brands separately.

Okay, looks like
we have us a brand off, folks.

This is exciting.

I am feeling it!

Ellen, I know you're not
used to being alone.

Neither was I,
hence wife number three.

don't rush.

Take some time
to get yourself centered.

Yo, yo, yo!
What's happening, Sheridan!

Ellen in the house.

Let me hear some noise.

Yeah. Oh!
All right, all right.

We got some haters.
That's cool.

Ellen, did you design
a logo?

Sure did.
Show it, player.

George, she's talking
to you.

(Gordon)
Oh, good impact.

Boom, cupcake business.

But, um...

Where's the name
of your business.

Oh, I didn't want one.

I just wanted it
to be cool.

So let me
get this correct.

You want to make t-shirts
for your business

with no business connection.

Okay.

This is your journey,
but it might end here.

No, no, no, see,
it's a cupcake,

and we sell cupcakes,
so that's the "bidness."

Okay, you know what?
Screw this!

That t-shirt is way cool,
and if you can't see it,

this seminar is so not worth
the $1,000 I paid.

Peace out.

[Feedback whines]

In business,
we call that a meltdown.

It happens.

So why don't we bring up
Ellen's former partner Pam.

Let's give Pam
a round of applause.

Max, I don't have
to go up there.

Come on,
we can just leave.

Oh, look who wants

to pack up
their guitar suitcase and go.

You know what?

I was only leaving
'cause you failed.

I believe
in my ideas.

Good afternoon.
Hello, hi.

I represent
Max's homemade cupcakes.

(Gordon)
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

Why Max's cupcakes?

Why not Ellen's
or Pam's?

Well, um...

Max was--Max is
this very special person

and the inspiration
behind our whole business.

Got it.

So Max is
an emotional touchstone

for you
and your business.

Yes.

Valid.
Go on.

Great.

So the logo--

George.

This is our current
company logo,

and I feel
it works just fine.

I mean, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it, right?

Okay.

Well, the cupcake
shows a mix of sweet imagery

because we're two girls trying
to retro-repurpose the phrase

"sugar and spice
and everything nice."

Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Leave Pam alone!

I'm fine, Ellen.

They can't shut me down,
because I believe in us

and our special brand
of artisan cupcakes.

Why?

Give me!

Eat it, you losers!
Eat it, eat it!

I see the truth balls
have stopped.

It looks like "eat it, eat it,
you losers,"

might just be your brand.

You two are a combination
of sugar and spice

and things not so nice.

Speaking of truth, I need you
to pay Sandra for the seminar.

As much as I admire
your pluck,

12 trips to the pasta bar
aren't free.

Come on, Pam.
Yeah, let's go, Ellen.

I'm Ellen.

Guess what I have
under my coat.

Well, I know
it's not a boob reduction.

What do you think?
Cool, huh?

Aw, man, somebody
already makes that?

Oh, bummer.

This is like when I thought
I invented chip-wiches.

Should've known.
I was eating one at the time.

No, Max, this is
your shirt.

I got the rendering
from the seminar

and had it made it

we can make anything
in under an hour.

You know, that place
under the bridge

near the underage bar
where you got under arrest.

[Gasps]
No way.

Oh, no way.
That's hot.

I know, and a girl
at the place

asked me
where she could get one.

Really?

Kind of in love
with myself right now.

Hey, what made you change
your mind about the t-shirts?

Well, one of the things
I learned at wharton

is that success depends
on staying open

to a better idea,
even if it's not yours.

Aw.
- And here.

I thought you'd
rather a black one.

On tinder and in life.

Earl, can you break some 20's?

The big spenders at table two

wanna split their $11 check three ways,

even though one person
did all the eating.

I was in a three-way once.
Same thing happened.

Max, table ten would like the check.

And don't forget to pick
up customer comment card.

Customers very important.

It's all about the fans.

Yeah, I'm not a fan of hearing
what people have to say.

For instance, what's
happening right now...

Not a fan.

Max, feedback from customers is
very important business tool.

Perhaps we'll pump the brakes
on sour waitress attitude.

There's only one tool
that can change my 'tude,

But I'm gonna need two
double-a batteries.

And a 20-minute break.

Welcome, everyone.

Thanks for coming to very important.

First official diner meeting.

This ain't right, man.
2:00 A.M. starts Earl time.

Earl, here's your brandy.

Okay, we're good now.

If I knew we were gonna have
staff meetings after work,

I would've taken job
at T.G.I. Friday instead.

Over there, they roll fast and loose.

Well, this is how I roll.

Yeah, short and slow.

No, I roll fast and furious.
Tokyo drift style.

Han, I'm starting to drift.
Can we get to the point?

Max and I still have to get home
and bake cupcakes for tomorrow.

We received so many excellent
comments from customers tonight.

Okay, first comment.

"dark-haired waitress..."
- hey!

"was very rude."

Hey!

Max, customers are giving.

Their honest opinions about diner.

We need to take it seriously.

Next comment.

"why does cashier wear earphones?

I thought he was a dj."

♪ go, earl, go, earl ♪

Holla!

Moving on.

"this meatloaf tastes stale and dry."

♪ yeah, oleg yeah, oleg ♪

It also says that cook
could wear deodorant.

And shirt that covers armpit.

- This is on card?
- Yes.

You are lying.

Yes.

Remind me never to be a spy with Han.

So this is how you tell
me what you think of me?

You hide behind outdated
method of feedback?

What, I should've posted
twitpic of my face like this?

Maybe I will send you a
twitpic of my meatloaf.

Can you twits pick
another time to do this?

I've gotta go home.

I have to go home too...

And cut the remaining sleeves
off of all my shirts.

And then go buy more shirts.

And cut the sleeves off those shirts.

You must wear sleeves.

Do not tell me what to do.

I was working here when you
were still a dumpling.

On your father's chopstick.

Now this is starting to
sound like earl time.

- Did it light?
- No.

Try another one. The gas is on.

Ah!

Why are we throwing fire at an oven?

Is this a poor people game?

Yeah, it's called light
the broken pilot light.

Without blowing our faces off!

This is ridiculous.
My heart is pounding.

I didn't know baking cupcakes
was an extreme sport.

It's like the deadliest batch.

See? A slight hint of gas in the air.

Makes everything funnier.

Now there's too much gas.

If we threw a math in there now,

I'd be out a nose or a pair
or a pair of eyebrows.

And I'm not living through that again.

Again?

When I was a little girl,

I was trying to make
a hungry man dinner.

And I lit the pilot light
too soon and whoosh!

No eyebrows.

Had to draw them on in magic marker.

Only mexican girls would talk to me.

Max, we have a cupcake business.

We have to tell the landlord
we need a new oven.

We can't ask the
landlord for a new oven.

Then he'll ask us stuff
like "who are you?

"why is your name not on the lease,

And where's the rent?"

Well, I'll buy us one.

Really?
You're gonna buy us a whole oven?

We're so poor I have a sock that
I refer to as my good sock.

I've been saving something
for an emergency,

Like a burst appendix or
a first date bikini wax.

I knew it!

You have a secret stash of your
father's missing billions.

We're rich!

Wait, it's other people's money.

Yeah, but I didn't steal it. We're rich!

They're my expensive rings.

So if these are your expensive rings,

What's all that other stuff you wear?

Cheaper copies.

You never wear the good
stuff out in public.

Got it, kind of like hiding
the banana republic.

And wearing the gap.

See how special?

They're all one-of-a-kind
from thomas aristotle thomas.

T-a-t. Tat.

What?

Tat rings.
You've never heard of tat rings?

Oh! Tat rings. No.

I guess it's the kind of thing.

That only people in the
know know, you know?

No.

Make all the jokes you want,

But I only have to sell one of these.

And I can get us a new oven.

Any ideas what kind we should get?

Uh, yeah, you're not the only
one with a secret stash.

It's the Bluestar.

It's the tat rings of ovens.

In purple!

That's right, I said purple.

It's the muscle car of ovens.
It's bad-ass!

It's so bad-ass when I do karaoke

I change the lyrics from
purple rain to purple range.

Great, we'll get this one.

Uh, we can't buy that.
It's too expensive.

This is just something
you fantasize about.

It's kitchen porn.

Fine.

Tomorrow we'll go to the
cash for gold store.

And get a regular oven and get cookin'.

I think the funny gas is gone.

Must be time. I'm going in.

Let me do it, my eyebrows
need to waxed anyway.

Hurry up! The gas is on!
Throw the match in!

- Did it light?
- No, but my foot is on fire.

I'll do it.

You're good.

I'm sorry, but how much
longer do we have to wait.

To get cash for our gold?

I told you before I'm on the phone.

Sit down, shut up, don't be rude.

I thought she'd be nicer
from her picture.

On the bus stop bench.

Yeah, and where are the dollar signs?

Let me see, which ring should I sell?

So much history in my lap.

I don't even wanna tell you
about the history in my lap.

My father got me this one in london.

I got this one in paris
to reward myself.

For not crying during the turbulence.

On the flight to paris.

My mom got me a fresca when
she hit me with her car once.

I got this one when I was 18.

It was my very first tat. Okay, stop!

This was a bad idea.
Let's get out of here.

I told you before. I'm on the phone!

Sit down, shut up, don't be rude.

I'm only sitting down because look.

She has her hand on a gun that's
strapped under the counter.

She is dying to plug us.

Max, what are you talking about?

Why is this a bad idea?

I don't want you sacrificing
your precious rings, frodo.

Because if the business
doesn't work out,

It'll be my fault you have nothing.

And call me selfish,

The only life I wanna ruin is my own.

Max, the business will go up and down.

That's natural.

But this ring is about more than
the day to day of the business.

It's about us...
And our future together.

Yo, did you just ask me to marry you?

You could do worse.

Now, ladies, gold. Now.

Come on. It's only one ring.

And when it comes to us, I'm
in this for the long haul.

Or until this lady shoots us.

- Hi, I'm here to...
- come on! Let's go.

Don't push me I'm out of nicorette.

Well, you're all business, aren't you?

I can respect that.

I'd like to exchange a tat ring.

I've never heard of a tat ring.

Thomas aristotle thomas?

World-famous designer?

Yeah, talk down to me.
That'll make the price better.

All right, I'll weight it.

What's that smell?

Is someone making soup in the back?

None of your business.

I will give you $275.

It's worth $2,500.

Where? In 2005?

You're just taking advantage of people.

Because the world economy is crashing.

It's called cash for gold, not
sympathy for flat chicks.

You know what? This is inappropriate.

All right, I'd like to see
your business license.

Maybe I'll make a call to
the chamber of commerce.

- Oh, you will, huh?
- Duck! Here comes the gun!

Maybe I'll make a call
to my boys in the back.

Sal! Richard!

Oh, hello. Let's get out of here.

Are you sure?
Because I'm kinda feeling richard.

Max, I was just in the ladies' room.

And I had a thought.

Why am I doing my lipstick in a
mirror that says "die carlos""

I know how to get the
full value of the ring.

We just have to take it to the
store where they sell it,

And return it.

Uh, and why didn't that
occur to you before?

'cause I don't have the receipt.

And I bought it three years ago...

From another store...
In another country.

The customer asked for crust
off of a turkey club.

Did they say that or is
this something you say.

That they said?

They said it.

But I say I see "screw the
bos"" sleeveless tee.

I'm sorry, someone call Ripley's.

There is a small mouse speaking.

And I bet for sure it comes
with stinky armpits.

Why don't you see for
yourself, ratatouille?

I've gotta go. Fight's starting.

You are stinky.

So stinky my mother in
Korea called me and said,

"What is that smell?"

I am surprised you're
upset by man smell.

Most women like you enjoy it.

Yo, Max, I got 20 bucks on Han.

He's scrappy.

Your english is terrible.

My english is less terrible
than your terrible english.

What? I couldn't understand
a word you said.

What? So sorry I couldn't
understand a word you said.

- Excuse me, regular-sized people.

I am on break until he apologizes.

I think the round's over.

I couldn't understand a word they said.

He needs to apologize. I'm the boss.

Don't let him get to you, Han.

Every woman knows size doesn't matter.

I like your shirt.

Reminds me of the side of the
van I lost my virginity in.

That little man disrespect me.

He insult my food, my
english, my "hyjane."

Is there anything I can
do to cheer you up?

A hug would help.

If I hug you, will you go back to work?

Yes.

- Two-second hug. I'm going in.

Aww.

How did you do that?
Your hands never left my back.

I am david blaine of zippers.

I was trying to cheer you up.

You did.

Wow, it's so surreal being back here.

I grew up here. It was like camp for me.

I learned who all the
best designers were,

How to color coordinate,
how to ride a bike.

They let you ride a bike here?

Bitch, I owned this piece.

If there's not an iguana in here,

This place is stupid.

Oh, my god.

They are such gorgeous tat rings.

- Thanks!
- Hate you! So jealous!

- Thanks!
- Bye!

Seeing you in your natural
habitat is truly disturbing.

Hi! Can I help you?

Hi! I'd like to return a ring
I got as a present here.

Tat rings are so amazing.

I can't believe you want to return it.

Well, this one's from a
guy I'm no longer with,

So it's painful to even look at.

I understand.

But I couldn't take it
back without a receipt.

The thing is he used to hit her.

Max! You did not!

Caroline, it's not your fault.

That's awful.

I understand why you
wouldn't want this ring.

I'm sure there's something I can do.

It's not our fault. I mean...Your fault.

Caroline Channing?

Jeffrey!

Surprised to see me working here?

Well, I got fired from that other store.

Whose name I will never mention again.

After last year's
cigarette butt incident.

I'm so sorry.

I had no idea those menthol
slim 100s were yours.

I just thought so many
butts on the ground.

Outside the store was gross,
so I said something.

Well, that one comment from
the great Caroline Channing.

About those butts fired my little butt.

You'd be happy to know
that I quite smoking.

After you got me fired.
Couldn't afford it.

I also couldn't afford
my gym membership.

Which is why my fired
little butt got massive,

Why no one wanted to date me, and
why I spent gay pride alone.

Fortunately, I wound up working here.

Yeah, it all worked out.
Your butt looks tight.

It's halfway there.

So I got the price on the ring.

You're buying a ring? A tat ring?

Actually, I'm returning.

Oh, can I see the receipt?

As manager of the jewelry department,

I couldn't possibly return
a ring that you bought.

At least three years
ago without a receipt.

You wouldn't want me to lose
my job again, would you?

I got this, donna.

And so sorry to hear about
your father being a criminal.

And you being penniless
and all that ugliness.

But it is kinda karma.

You are where you are now,
and I'm back on top.

Look, jeffrey, I know we just met,

But there's no way you're a top.

Now what are we gonna do?

We should hunt down that
super fake jealous lady.

Who hates you.

Maybe she'll buy one.

Max, that's brilliant.

If anybody's gonna buy a tat ring,

They're already in the store.

We can have a pop-up sale!

- A pop-up sale?

- You don't know what a pop-up sale is?

You didn't know what a pilot light was.

it's the new trend.

Mini stores pop up and sell stuff,

Then they're gone.

That's not a new trend.

Drug dealers have been
doing that for years.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

What are you doing, beautiful mind?

I'm mentally scanning the
layout of the store.

For security cameras.

I knew coming here and not
going to parks as a child.

Would pay off.

Okay, there's only one place
we could pull it off.

Where there are no cameras.

Where?

- Pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

That's right, ma'am!

I said pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

I don't do improv.

So did we sell the ring yet?

Those women weren't
our target customers.

We're looking for a very specific type.

Too much style and money to burn.

hold the elevator!

and I love new york!

Pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

I'll take you in two at a time.

Let me go check with my associate.

And I'll be right back
for adin and lublubah.

Such a good memory.

Hard to forget such beautiful names.

Ready?

We have a pooper in stall two.

Who shops and plops? I mean, really.

- Trust me, I smell the match.
Classic shop and plop cover-up.

Where are the two Kit Kats we
got from the vending machine?

I told you I was hungry.

Arabic women expect a gift
when they buy something.

Well, stall number two.

Will probably supply a little present.

- Hi, are you here for the pop-up sale?

- No, I just have to pee.
- Oh, geez.

Come on, don't waste my time!

One stall's open... in and out!
Running a business!

That woman pushed ahead of us.

Do not sell her my tat ring.

It's fun. You're here to pick up.

She's here to drop off.

Open the shop.

We're a good team.

You set 'em up, I knock 'em down.

- Why is?
- I don't know, it just is.

Are you here for the pop-up sale?

- A pop-sale in the bathroom?

So lame. So lame.

Caroline? Jen, Robin!

- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god.

- Excuse me.
When will pop-up sale start?

We have lunch reservations for
five at Four Seasons at 3:00.

Why are you asking me?

- You two are doing pop-up sale, no?

No.

I have nothing to do with this
pop-up sale in the bathroom.

- So lame.
- So lame.

So lame!

So lame.

Come to lunch with us.

Oh, I've already eaten.

Our treat.

We are not taking no for an answer.

They're not taking no for an answer.

Sell the ring.

Where is she going?
I thought you two were a team.

Apparently not.

So sorry.

I got caught up in a
hostage nicoise situation.

How'd it go?

Did you get full price for the ring?

Oh, do you know me?

Because I could've sworn
you didn't know me.

My new friends Adin and Lablueballs.

Thought it was weird that
you just bailed on me.

Max, I panicked in the moment.

I didn't want those
girls telling everyone

that Caroline Channing was in a
bathroom selling her jewelry.

I'm barely back on my feet
after the whole scandal.

I just couldn't bare it.

Here.

I didn't sell them because
I didn't buy the whole

"in it for the long haul"
thing from the beginning.

And I was right because
I'm always right.

About people in the long haul.

Max, I'm talking to you.

It's cool. We don't need to talk.

Max, about the rings, I'm sorry.

I don't know what else to say.

You don't need to say anything.

You already said a lot of words
about the future and us,

And then next thing I know,
you were "oh, my god!"

Off to lunch with your friends.

Max, I am in this for the long haul.

Isn't there anything I can
say to convince you of that?

Nope. And it's fine.

It's not you, it's me.

I'm the idiot who actually
believed for a minute.

That we had a future.

But it's okay.

We'll just keep getting by like
we are, for the short haul.

Cool?

Max.

Hey! Hey.

What's that smell? I'm making cupcakes.

- You lit the pilot light?
- Didn't have to. Look.

No way! The Bluestar in purple?

What the... how did it get...

How can... how could you afford that?

You sold your tat? Sold them all.

Spent it on the oven, next-day
delivery fee and installation.

That woman gave you a better price?

No, she pulled a gun on me.

So I went to every gold
store in Brooklyn,

leveraged their offers
against each other

until I got enough to buy the Bluestar.

You didn't have to do that.

After what I did, there
were no more words.

Only ovens.

And our future means more to
me than rings from my past.

I told you, I'm in this
for the long haul.

For the record, I hated
lunch with those girls.

I'd rather split a Kit Kat in
a bathroom with you any day.

I'm sorry I wasn't listening.

I was staring at my new
boyfriend over there.

I wanna make out with it!

Ooh. Ow! Hot!

There's not a ding!

There's a ding. My rings bought a ding.

You wanna hug me, don't you?

Yeah.

- But you're not gonna.
- Yes, I am.

If you unzip my shirt,
I'm gonna be pissed!

Impressed, but pissed.

Max.
Do you have any gum?

My breath tastes
like someone else's breath.

You're asking me
if I have any gum?

That's like asking New Jersey
if it has any sluts.

Great. There were onions
in my street meat.

Listen to me.
"Onions in my street meat."

Last year, I was taking meetings
on wall street.

This year, I'm eating meat
from the street by a wall.

Let's see.
Phone, chapstick.

A pill! Could be birth control,
could be ecstasy.

Waiting for a day off
to find out.

Why wait?

If I start touching your hair
in an hour,

don't let me have sex
with anyone.

Max!

Max, what's this?

It's addressed
to Max's homemade cupcakes.

Really? I thought
that was just a thing

I wrote
the new pizza place info on.

It's a $200 check
from that office party we did.

Max's homemade cupcakes
in type!

No way, I've never been
typed out before!

I've been cash, I've sweaty 20s
pushed into my palm,

but I've never been typed!

We's all grown up!
We's legit!

Listen up, diner!
I just hit the big time.

No more serving up slop
to you lowlifes.

So everybody can suck it!
My waitress days are over.

Can I get some more coffee?

Sure.

Earl, what are you doing?

Employees are not allowed
to drink diner liquor.

Now, hold up, Han.
It's April 16th.

Do you know what day
tomorrow is?

Oh, of course.
Happy Martin Luther King day.

Enjoy a drink on me.

It's not
Martin Luther King day.

Black people are allowed

to be excited about
other days too, you know.

It's tax day.

And I always treat myself
to a Brandy when I do my taxes

because I need to be drunk
when I see that refund amount.

Chicken breast,
side of hot sauce.

Breast? Hot sauce?
Come on, it's right there.

Max, now that I have
big love for Sophie,

I no longer say inappropriate
sexual things to other women.

I save all my hot sauce
for her breasts.

Love has made you
a real old lady.

Here you go, Brandy man.
Enjoy.

Max, you got a stamp?

I wanna drop this off
in the mail on my way home.

I have one in my purse.
I'll just get it.

Max, he wants to file
this year.

He doesn't have time
for the search party

to go into your purse
and return.

Hey, it's a purse.
It's supposed to be messy.

No, it's supposed
to be a purse,

not a retirement home
for a pair of panties

stuck to old lifesavers.

I'm kinda off my meal now.

I have a stamp
right here, Earl.

There, see?
Order versus chaos.

Also known as OCD versus

"Oh, here's a CD
I forgot I had."

Would you prefer a flower,
flag, or a love stamp?

Ladies, I don't care which,
I just wanna get these taxes

in the mail
before the deadline.

- Earl, you do your own taxes?
- I surely do.

Proud to say I haven't
missed a year since 1950

when I had my first job
as Frank Sinatra's ball boy.

Ball boy?
Was he a good tennis player?

No, darling,
he didn't play tennis.

The job was washing his balls.

And that was good work
for those times.

Do you mind
if I look over your 1040

to see if I can increase
your return?

Do you, Wharton, do you.

Well, at first glance,
I see you short-changed yourself

on some deductions.

There's 500 right there.

Why don't you sign this now,
and I'll save you what I can

and then drop it in the mail
tomorrow?

Max, look at this.

Blonde ambition here
just saved me $500.

Really? That's pretty cool.

Oh! There's another 100.

- No way, that's awesome.
- Ding, ding, ding.

It's like I won the slots
without being surrounded

by those pissed off ladies
with emphysema.

How could you not know

there was a cupcake check
in your purse?

It just got mixed in.

And anyway, who still sends
important stuff

through the mail these days?

What are we, pioneers?

No, we're businesswomen,

and we need to keep track
of every penny.

Hey, should we frame it
and hang it on the wall?

That way when we're
two billionaire bitches

who hate each other's guts,

we can look at the check
and remember.

Max, I'll never hate your guts.

You don't know.

Business pressure,

you caught me sleeping
with your husband,

anger about your bad facelift.

Oh, honey, I will never
have a bad facelift.

I've been collecting names
of good doctors since I was 11,

and I was terrified
by my piano teacher

whose nose was suddenly here.

That's pretty cool of you
to do Earl's taxes for him.

I'm happy to.

After all, finance is my field
of expertise.

Yeah, pretty cool.
You know, all that stuff.

Helpful hints and whatnot.

Cripes! What more
do I have to do,

Rouge my boobs and stand in a
storefront window in Amsterdam?

Are you gonna help me
with my taxes or not?

Max, I don't know
if it's a good idea.

I've seen your purse.
I can only imagine your taxes.

Can you let go of the purse?
It's just a messy bag.

It's not like I lost your child
in the outback.

It's symptomatic.
Here, look at my purse.

You know what, never mind.

It's too late
for a purse smackdown.

But for the record,
even if you win now,

my purse will kick
your purse's ass.

Later, after it spent two weeks
learning your purse's schedule.

Organized, clean, perfect.
Look.

Just look at it.

Look at it, Max.
It won't bite.

Who are you,
my mother's third boyfriend?

And truthfully,
before I saw that check,

I wasn't even going to file.

But now that our business
is getting real,

maybe I should start getting
real about my finances.

I mean, when we are
two billionaire bitches,

I don't want the government
to swoop in

and Wesley snipe us
for back taxes.

Okay, great.
We'll do it tomorrow.

And I promise, no more
purse slams starting now.

Who is that?

CNN. They found a 34th Chilean
miner in your purse.

Okay, okay!
Starting now.

- Who is it?
- Kim Kardashian.

No.
I'm not Kim Kardashian.

No, I work for a living.

Hey, Sophie, you come down
for your cupcake nightcap?

Yeah, thank you, Max.

But tonight
I'm going to take two.

'Cause I'm getting
ready to date

and I wanna get back
to my fighting weight.

Sophie, what do you mean

you're getting ready
to date again?

Oh, well, there's
some really cute new guys

down at the Polish club.

And--oh, my gosh,
one in particular

is like a cross between
Vin Diesel and Viggo Mortensen.

Yeah, so rich and handsome

you almost don't notice
the wheelchair.

Hard to resist a man in
New York who's got his own ride.

I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.

Oh, then don't.

It's just what about
you and Oleg?

He thinks you two are a couple.

A couple?

No, this is crazy talk.

I mean, yes, we have had
some hot, dirty sex

in a few kitchens
and toilets, and...

On the floor of a sandwich
shop in the subway.

Plus twice we did it like dogs
on the hallway stairs

and on every smooth surface
in my apartment.

But I mean, come on.
I mean, that's it.

I'm a lady.

Sophie, I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

but for Oleg,
it's not just about sex.

He feels things for you.

I know for a fact
he's buying you a special gift.

Tell her, Max.

Well, he mentioned
something about a fur,

and tonight
when he was talking about you

he did use the word "love."

Love?

Come on, don't ruin
my cupcake buzz.

I mean, this man has no future.

Of course, he does have
a giant penis.

But no future.

I mean, I've worked hard
to get where I am.

I need a man who has a dream
and a drive.

And I can buy a big giant
penis online for $47.

Really?
Add to cart.

Well, then you have to tell him

you're not interested
in going any further.

Oh, all right, don't worry.
I will.

Yeah, I mean,
I need this man in my life

like I need breast implants.

Which is like...
Not at all, right?

Here's another W-2,
H&R blonde.

Thank you.

Max, you worked
at a Mexican restaurant

in long island city?

Oh, my God,
don't be so judgmental.

Mira, look!

I just found a receipt for shoe
insoles and double-stick tape.

Work expense.

Again, senorita,
not a write-off.

Like when you asked if you could
claim your pot dealer

as an entertainment expense.

So I was wrong.
We've all got our talents.

You're great
at doing paperwork,

and I'm great at baking

and finding places to have sex
at carnivals.

Just add that to the pile
I'm calling

"evidence
for your future audit."

Not there,
that's Earl's tax return.

Can I see a copy
of what you filed last year?

Ugh...I didn't file
last year.

Or the year before
or any year ever.

Wait, you've never paid
your taxes?

No, I've never filed my taxes.

I've paid taxes.
I see it on my check.

$8 to the state,
$15 in federal income,

$6.23 to Fica,
whoever that lucky bitch is.

Max, why didn't you tell me
the severity of this last night?

Um, maybe you haven't noticed,
but I have issues around money.

Every year,
I say I'm going to file,

and then I put it off
and put it off

until the day it's due,
like today,

and then I sit down
with a 1040 and my W-2s,

and right around
the fourth question,

I'm like, screw it!

I'm gonna watch old soul train
clips on YouTube before work.

And then I feel like a loser
until tax day is over.

And then I'm like,
who cares? I'm awesome.

I'll do them next year.

So what you're telling me

is your finances are as messy
as your purse.

Careful now!

Starting to get a little hot
up in here.

Fine, I don't care.

I just want you
to get your taxes done.

Now throw away
all of your useless garbage

into this trash can.

You know what, I'm just gonna
go to that pop-up tax place

near the diner.

And I'll throw my "useless
garbage" in the dumpster

on the way out.

Wait, you're gonna spend
like $100

to have someone do your taxes

when I'm sitting right here.

The amount of money
I'll spend down there

is nothing compared
to the amount of money

I'd have to spend on weed
to survive doing taxes with you.

- Good afternoon, girls.
- Hello.

I hope Sophie and I's
wild lovemaking

didn't keep you up all night.

We wanted to come down

and show you the gift
I just gave Sophie.

Yeah, look, girls.
Look at my gift.

It's got a leg.

Wow, I didn't think you two
were the couple type.

We are going into Manhattan

for fruit cocktail
and champagne.

- Want to join?
- Hell, yeah!

No, Max,
you're doing your taxes.

Oh. My mother says
I can't come out.

Have fun.

This means nothing!

I can't believe you're putting
your financial future

into the hands of a hipster
tax place

called "The Tax of Life."

You know
how the old proverb goes.

"You take the good,
you take the bad.

You take what's left, and there
you have the tax of life."

43! Number 43.

And remember,
if you need any help,

I'm acquainted
with your finances.

And I'm acquainted
with your attitude.

Don't say a word.

- I'm 43.
- 'Sup, 43?

I'm Kyle.
I'm your tax bro.

Hi, I'm Max and this is
my mute friend Caroline.

I already started
to fill out the 1040

and I have my W-2s
from this year.

Also some receipts.

Well, let's get started!

Do you have a health savings
account?

- Definitely not.
- Oh, well, we can fudge that.

- I'll put you down for 500.
- Sounds good.

Fudge that? Fudge?

I wasn't aware
there was fudging in finance.

Domestic production activities.

- Like condoms and stuff?
- I guess.

Talk about adjusted
gross income, am I right?

Am I right?

Kyle, put me down for 250.

250.

Should I just put the cheese
plate out for the IRS now?

What about residential
energy credits?

I bought some of those
curly light bulbs once.

Oh, that's another 150 easily.

Sorry, Max,
I can't stop myself.

Money, finances--
this is my thing.

If we were at a copper-plated
jewelry sale,

I'd let you take the wheel.

I can't sit back and watch you
risk our financial future.

You'll be dragging me into this
with you and your tax bro.

Excuse me, tax bro.

Oh, my God, you wanna claim
a residential energy credit?

You don't even have a 5695
up here.

Hey, your mute friend's
all over this.

You should let her
do your taxes.

She's way better.

No, that's cool, Kyle.
I'm not gonna do this.

One more year won't kill me.

I'll just
spend this money on pot.

That's an entertainment
expense, bee-tee-Dubbs.

Max, don't give up yet.
Let me help.

Look, it's already 9:00.
We ran out of time.

At least take a form
and file an extension.

The post office
is open till midnight.

Max, you know you wanna change
your finances.

It's a step.

You're right.
Good idea.

They have extension forms
at the post office.

We can pick one up
when I drop off Earl's return.

- What?
- It's not here.

It's not in my purse.

Last time I saw it,
it was on the coffee table

before you came in
with all your tax stuff.

It must still be there.

Uh, no, you made me throw
all that stuff out.

You threw out
a 75-year-old man's tax return?

You threw some papers out too.

This is so not like me.

The only thing I've ever lost
is my virginity.

What are we gonna do?

No, it's okay. Relax.
No big deal.

We just have to go home
and climb through the dumpster.

No, seriously,
what are we gonna do?

Ready?

No, seriously,
what are we gonna do?

Well, let's get to it.

My garbage
ain't gonna find itself.

Max, I can't.

If I go in there,
I will literally be white trash.

Look, you're the one
who had to butt in

and get all "Wharton" with Earl.

If you had left him alone,

it would be at the post office
safe and sound.

Fine.

But to be clear,
if we find a baby in there,

you're raising it on your own.

Hey, it's already off
to a better start than I had.

There's food everywhere.

Oh, hell, no!
It's Tuesday--trash pick up!

Better get in and out

or we'll be on a garbage barge
to coney island.

Come on,
I'll give you ten fingers.

My shoes.
My dignity.

My shoes.

My hands are touching
a dumpster.

All right,
on the count of three,

I'll push,
you hoist yourself up.

But really pull yourself up,
or you won't make it.

It's hell.
I'm looking into hell.

1...2...3!

Whaa!

I wanted to scream,
but it wouldn't come out.

Okay, well, good luck.
See ya.

- Max!
- I'm kidding!

I'm coming around the back.
I found a place to get a leg up.

Now?
You just saw that now?

Aah!

Why'd you scream?
You knew it was me.

That's the one
I couldn't get out before.

Oh, God, look at this mess.

It's like looking for
a dirty needle in a haystack,

which I've done.

Okay, start poking around.
Look for familiar garbage.

"Familiar garbage"?

I hate it in here.
I wanna die.

It's not that bad.

My mom and I once spent
five hours in a dumpster

looking for proof that her
boyfriend was cheating on her,

and all we found was
a scratch-off worth a $1.50

and a beach towel.

And then, we used that $1.50

to take the towel
to the laundromat.

12 years later,
you and I use that very towel

to dry ourselves off
after a shower.

Well, I'm standing on
a stranger's cold sesame noodles

with egg shells
stuck to my ankles.

You win, Max.

What does that have to do
with me?

It means I'm officially
standing in your purse.

How about more real garbage,
less Caroline garbage?

Caroline garbage?

You have been dumping
on me all day.

Me? What have I done?

"Max, you didn't file...ever?"

I didn't say it like that.

And you didn't file ever.
Is that my fault?

Yes! This is all your fault.

Before I met you, I didn't
even think about a future.

Now I have a future,
and I'm standing in a dumpster!

You are not the only one
standing in a dumpster.

And...get a new purse.

If you had been able
to find a stupid stamp

in that horrid thing,

I would've never even seen
Earl's taxes

and I wouldn't be standing
in a dumpster.

Max, no, no, no!

I will never, ever
recover from that!

Red bulls? Red bulls?
Are those our red bulls?

Where?

Yes! Yes!
That's my garbage!

That's my garbage!
Get over here!

If we find it,
we'll have enough time

to shower and get to
the post office.

Earl's taxes!
Earl's taxes!

Next!

This is unbelievable.

Everyone trying to get their
taxes filed by midnight.

Wow, I haven't seen this much
last-minute licking

since the cops raided
that Thai massage parlor.

- I'll grab an extension form.
- You get in line.

The line's longer
than I expected.

No, we have to file.
She's nursing.

Don't worry.
We're fine.

I'm a bum.

She's got a baby hanging off her
nipple and her taxes are done.

Max, you can't compare
yourself to other people.

You'll do it your way.

And there's a blind guy.

No eyes, taxes done.

I guess he wasn't distracted
by YouTube clips.

Don't be so hard on yourself.

You're filing an extension,
and then you'll get them done.

You say I'm going to file,
but will I?

I say I'm going to clean out
my purse, but do I?

Sophie says she's gonna
tell Oleg, but did she?

An extension
is just another excuse

for me to put it off
and create a bigger mess.

Hey, Max.
What's up?

Bob.
Wow, what are you doing here?

Oh, I just filed my taxes
like everyone else.

Bob had a good year.
Ha.

Who was that?

My dealer.
Forget the extension.

If my pot dealer can file,
I can file.

We still have half an hour.

Run home and get my W-2s

while I stay in line
and fill out the 1040.

Maybe I should stay
and fill it out,

and you can run home.

No, I have to do this.

Don't worry, if I get stumped,

I'm surrounded
by procrastinators.

One of them will help...
Eventually.

Okay, here's a pen.

I'm gonna go drop off
Earl's return in the slot,

and I'll be back
as soon as I can.

Okay.

Uh, hi, can you hold my place

while I get a tax form
for this year?

Oh, cutting it close.
You're worse than me.

- Go, I got your back.
- And she's got your front.

So I add up all these lines
and put the total here?

- Right.
- What about student loans?

Yes, and I paid mine off
this year.

Then claim it.

That interest
is a huge write off.

Put down $436 on line 33.

- Post office is closing!
- No!

My friend just texted me.
She's almost here.

Please,
I have to file this year.

Midnight is midnight!

Boo!

Oh, please,
I have six children at home.

This is nothing.

Here! I'm here, I'm here!
What time is it?

30 seconds.

Make room, make room.

Stapler, stapler.

- 10...
- Sign it! Sign your 1040!

- 9...
- Where?

8...7...

6...
Fold! Fold, you bastard!

5...4...

3...

2...

No stamp.

- What?
- Aw!

It's cool.
I got ya, boo.

I did it!
I filed my taxes!

Everybody can suck it!

Here's your check.

I didn't charge you for
the fries, 'cause I ate them.

[drone propellers whirring]

[gasps]
Max, look out!

The diner water bugs
are getting really big.

Relax, it's the diner's new
surveillance drone.

God, you empty the register
five or ten times,

suddenly there's no trust.

So to be clear, we're out of
soap but we have a drone?

I hate that Han's just sitting
in back, watching us,

working his little joy stick.

Please, no one's getting any joy
out of Han's little stick.

This is so annoying.

It's following me.

Well, with a butt that flat,
it's the only black thing

that's ever going to follow you.

Ugh, there's another drone
out here?

I just killed one in the kitchen
with a fly swatter.

Go.

I mean, if I wanted
to be spied on,

I'd change my name
to Achmed,

and buy a condo
near the airport.

Whatever happened
to buying a painting

of an old sea captain,
drilling out the eye holes,

and hiding behind it?

Not cool, Han.

And the worst part is,
it's moving around so much,

I can't find my good angle.

Not cool and not Han.

I stole this
while he was explaining to me

why a 77-year-old man,
on minimum wage,

doesn't need health care.

Earl, that is awesome.

Not really.
I need that health care.

No, that you stole that.

We need to do something
that will make Han

never want to spy
on us again.

Oleg, open your pants.

Earl, fly that camera
in there.

But first,
take off your underwear.

Underwear?

Come on.
What am I, five?

Inches?

Oleg, aren't you at all worried
about Earl's cataracts?

Best case scenario,
I get a little manscaping.

Worst case, I've been meaning
to get circumcised.

[Han's screams]

My eyes!

[screaming]

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

Max, I'm writing out
the check for our bank loan,

and I'm not quite sure
what our balance is

because here under "withdrawals"
you just wrote, "yeah."

Well, if you don't like that,
you're really not going to like

the picture I drew
under "deposits."

I saw it.

Max, zeroes are not balls,
they're not boobs,

and they're not googly eyes.

They're just zeroes.

Says you.

I'll go check our balance
at the ATM.

Even though the last guy
who touched it

had a cold sore so big,

I charged him
for a party of two.

Don't worry. You are not
going to get anything

from that machine.

Especially cash.

Hey, everybody.

Oh, yeah.

Somebody better make me
some eggs

because I've been on
a juice cleanse for three hours,

and I'm dizzy.

Yeah.
I mean, they call it a fast,

but it sure does go slow.

I was on a three weeks fast,
once.

Then I realized my mother
wasn't coming home.

So I made a sandwich.

Oleg and my wedding
is coming up

and we're trying to eat clean.

Yeah, baby, 'cause you know
we're eating dirty

on the honeymoon.

[screaming]

Oh, dear God, what?

Another used condom
in the receipt slot?

- Worse.
- What?

Stuff that should be
in a condom but isn't?

We're below zero.

Oh, well,
I better go, y'all.

A white woman screaming
anywhere in my vicinity

never turns out well.

This is a disaster.

I've been at zero,

but I've never
had less than zero.

Oh, don't say that, Caroline.

I mean, you're forgetting
about your dating options.

We have less than zero money

and no way
of paying off our bank loan.

Oh, my God.
It happened.

I'm working class.

Hey. I've waited tables
with you for four years

and there's no way you could
call what you do working.

Cupcakes!

Buy cupcakes.

Buy cupcakes!

Stop.

You look more desperate
than Justin Bieber

in that Calvin Klein ad.

You don't understand
the seriousness

of this bank situation.

You don't understand the rules
of World Of Warcraft.

The loan just keeps escalating
and escalating

until they close us down.

Cupcakes!
Buy cupcakes!

Buy cupcakes!
Buy cupcakes!

Oh, Pay-dirt.
Look.

Here comes a big, fat
frat house guy.

Hey, bitches.

Remember me?

Big Mary.

That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

John, we haven't seen you
since pastry school.

Hey, for old times' sake,
want to buy a cupcake?

A dozen?
The shop?

So I came because
I may know of a way

for Max to make
some extra money.

Whatever it is,
she'll do it.

That was my yearbook quote.

I just got hired
at a new restaurant

that's opening
under the High Line Park

in Manhattan,
and they are looking

for another day pastry chef.

I only have a year
of pastry school

and I was stoned
for, like, a year of that.

I don't know
if I have the skills.

[chuckles]
Oh, girl, you don't.

But the manager, Joe,
wants only pretty people.

And what you lack in pastry,

you more than make up
for in pretty.

She'll do it.
You'll do it, Max.

And John will be there
to help back you up

with his pastry skills.

And 'cause I'm pretty.

I don't belong in a place
like that.

It's called "The High."

Sounds right.
Give me the deets.

Well, good night girls.

Sorry about your bank balance.

But I trust you'll both lapse

into denial fairly soon,
as always.

Hello.

Who was she?

Hold me closer,
tiny dancer.

Oh...Han's not gay.

You forgot the "yet."

Max, maybe button up
a button or two.

It's a dessert bar.
Not a strip bar.

Hey, I need this job,

and once this Joe guy takes
one look at these puff pastries,

he might cut me some slack
when he sees

my other "not so puff"
pastries.

And you're comfortable
with that?

Yup.

Like I guess
you're comfortable

applying for a waitress job

on just the merits
of your waitress skills.

Should I keep going?

Why?

I'm here.

I'll take those applications.
Hurry, ladies.

If I was looking for pretty
and slow, I'd hire Nick Jonas.

Max,
let's get out of here.

She reminds me
of this nightmare

I'm going to have
for the rest of my life.

Relax, she's just
his guard dog.

It's Joe guy
we have to impress.

No thank you.

No thank you.

And how dare you?

Oh, I'm sorry, the restaurant
doesn't open until tomorrow.

Actually, no.

Hi. I'm here to apply
for a waitress job.

At your age?

I'm 27!

And?

Max,
I can't breathe.

And I'm here to apply
for a pastry chef.

Also 27, but I've looked
this old since I was 6.

For a while, I thought I had
that Benjamin Button's disease.

I'll take the pastry chef
first.

Why don't you sit over there
and wait.

I won't be long,
because frankly,

you don't have the time.

Thank you.
I'll be over there.

Applying for Social Security.

So where did you go
to pastry school,

and why aren't you
working now?

Manhattan School Of Pastry,
and I am working.

I have my own cupcake shop
in Brooklyn.

Oh, it's almost over.

This interview? Great.

No. Not the interview.
Brooklyn.

Brooklyn's almost over.

Also, cupcakes.

Cool. I will tell them.

Wish I knew that
before they all got

their belly buttons pierced
trying to stay cool.

Oh, great.
A sense of humor.

Customers love that.

I don't, but they do.

So, um, where's this Joe guy
who's doing the hiring?

There is no "Joe guy."
I'm Joe.

Spelled, J-O-E-D-T-H.

The D-T-H is silent.

As am I,
because I want this job.

Well, I guess
I can put these away then.

That was your plan?

To expose your breasts and
seduce your way into this job?

You say that
like it's a bad thing.

Okay.
Well, bye.

Sit, sit.

If you really can bake,

this position might be
perfect for you.

Also, you have that edgy,

"I don't give a crap"
attitude.

Customers love that.

I don't, but they do.

Actually, Joe, silent D-T-H,
I can bake.

But how well?

My girlfriend and I are
obsessed with French pastry.

Oh. Girlfriend
as in "girlfriend,"

or as in two ladies
of a certain age

at a Cineplex
splitting one thing of popcorn?

Everything you just said
offended me.

Yeah, that's my brand.

And the fact
that you didn't cry

about splitting a popcorn
makes me think

it's the first kind of
girlfriend.

How are your macaroons?

Uh...oh. Mm.

My macaroons?

Great.

A little bit of French
heaven.

What is your name?

Max.

M-a-x.

[clicks teeth]

Nothing is silent.
Ever.

So I gather.

Okay. Why don't you go
fill out an application, Max.

And you can
put those away again.

I'm really not
into big-breasted women.

Girl, you got this.

First day.
Are you nervous, girl?

Please. Nervous is telling
your elderly Mormon parents

that you're gay
after your three older siblings

already came out.

I have no idea what most
of these desserts are.

I haven't felt this lost
since the finale of Lost.

Max, can you see any of the
Barney's price tags on these?

Uh, I think there's one
bunching up

inside the back
of your pants.

No, that's the underwear
I'm also returning.

Here she comes.

Hi, ladies.
This is Naomi,

the dessert bar hostess.

Go, Naomi, go.

Gorgeous, but as dumb as whoever
is the hot new idiot right now.

Let me take a look at you.

Good-bye.

Already?

Those pearls.
They have to go.

Really? It's just, well,

I'm kind of emotionally attached
to them.

Well, honey, I love
my half-blind French bulldog,

but I don't wear her
around my neck.

Max, let me take a look.

Love it.

Fabulous.
Well done.

Hi, Joe. Big day.
I'm so excited.

Why don't you be excited
in the back, doll?

I want Max up front now.

All my life, people have been
telling me not to come out.

Why should here
be any different?

Ladies, I just got word that
the New York Times food critic

may make a surprise visit
this afternoon.

Everything
has to be perfect--

the service,
the desserts,

the precarious balance
of my meds.

Nothing can go wrong.

Naomi.

Fetch.

"Welcome to The High."

"Hi. Welcome to The High."

"Welcome to The High."

Stop saying high.
It reminds me I'm not.

Wait, Max,
you're not high?

Like, not high at all?

No. I didn't want
to screw today up.

What the hell
is wrong with you?

You can't change
who you are today.

The New York Times
is coming.

How will you cope?

I mean, when's the last time
you weren't high?

My birth.

But I was really drunk.

I had just had
a bottle of wine.

Well, my mother had.

I have to go wait
on those customers.

Do what you can
to get with the program.

I mean, get off
the program.

You can't bake not baked.

Big Mary?

John?

Why not try my new name?

Quasimodo.

Do you have any weed?

Do I have any weed?

Let me check my hump.

Nope.
No weed.

Thanks, Rico.
I didn't want to ask

due to the city-wide ban
on racial profiling.

Wow.
This dish room is cleaner

than Chris Christie's plate
after lunch.

Max, I need two lavender
macaroons.

- Where are they?
- I'm working on them.

Well, good.
I'm so proud of you.

This is so Freaky Friday.

Here are the lavender macaroons.

See? Even just holding this,
I'm better.

Now we just have to hope
nothing goes wrong.

(Sophie)
Surprise!

We all came to support you.

(Caroline)
Well, that's it.

The New York Times food critic
may be in the same room

as Han, Earl,
Oleg, and Sophie.

We're dead.
Time of death, 11:30.

I believe it's more like 4:20.

Oh, Caroline,
I love your new place.

It's so fresh and pretty.

It kind of looks like
a douche commercial.

You're right, baby.

It looks exactly like
a douche commercial.

Okay.
Can we stop saying "douche"

in the fancy pastry shop?

I agree.
Not appropriate.

Caroline, darling,
slip my phone number

to that fine Nubian
princess.

And tell her not to be
fooled by my bad hip.

I can still gently
rock her world.

Okay, guys,
what are you doing here

and how quickly can you leave?

Real nice.

After we came all this way

to just order only desserts

that Max knows how to make

and to say nice things
about you as a waitress.

Oh, you'd do that for me?

Hell no,
I can't pull that off.

If I could act,
I'd sell the restaurant

and get cast in two-line roles
as the doctor

on any network television show.

Sophie's the actress.

And trust me,
she's got quite a repertoire.

In bed, I call her Meryl Sheets.

Do it, baby.

[Southern Belle accent]
Oh, what a lovely place.

That's the accent she uses
when we play

"12 Years A Sex Slave."

Lovely, be right back.

Oh, and, welcome to The High.

(Joedth)
What's going on
with that table?

Is there a European circus
in town?

A circus?
Well, I wouldn't know.

I really have no idea
who they are.

That didn't require an answer.

It was just one
of my dead-on observations.

Just get rid of them.

Tell them we've run out
of funnel cakes.

Well, I'm feeling like
my old self.

Joe just told me to lose Han,
Earl, Oleg, and Sophie.

How am I supposed to
lose that many people?

I'm not air traffic control.

You are acting like
they don't know how to act

in a fancy place.

[Sophie, yelling]
Girls, look!

Oleg's wearing
his napkin as a party hat.

[Sophie laughing]

Here's your dessert.
Bon appetite.

Max, I can't believe
you just made that.

Neither can I.

And what did you say
to Oleg and Sophie?

It's been an hour,
and I haven't seen

any over-the-table
penetration.

I just told them
to be on their best behavior,

and they're fine with it.

Excuse me, Max.

Yes, hi.

May I go tinkle?

Or is that against the law here
at Guantanamo Dessert Bay?

I'm gonna go have sex
in the ladies room.

Unless you two prudes
have a problem with that, too.

Excuse me.

Can I get a latte
and a red wine?

[clears throat]

'Cause I got a Vicodin
stuck in my throat.

Oh, my God.

Who could be that messed up

in the middle
of the afternoon?

Uh, my new best friend.

I better get rid of her
before Joe

or that Times critic
walks in.

You keep doing good things
by accident.

Hi, can I get a--

You sure can.
Anywhere but here.

(woman)
Oh, no. Spinning's not good
for me right now.

(Joedth)
What is she doing here?

Leaving.
You never saw her.

- Wait--
- Joe, I got this.

My bestie at school
was totally hooked

on prescription pills
for, like, a week.

Hey, hi, you.

Excuse me.
Where is Max?

She's in the back
for a sec.

So...

We meet again.

Sir, do you need something
in the back?

Yes, Caroline said
she'd bring me a napkin,

but I could get Time Warner
on the phone faster than that.

Just ask Max.

She covers for Caroline
all the time at the diner.

Max?

Ooh.
Drama at The High.

Han,
that's my new boss.

Stop talking.

Also, stop collecting stickers.
You're a grown-up.

Okay, I threw that drug addict
out.

That drug addict
is my girlfriend.

More drama at The High.

And Caroline,
we have a problem.

You called Allie
a drug addict.

Oh, is that her name?

Allie?
So cute.

Even lovelier.

And according
to that very small man,

you're also
a terrible waitress.

But I had no idea
you two were together.

I would have thought
a powerful...

Stop. Now.

Joe, look, we really need
these jobs.

We made a bad decision
with our bakery business,

and we have a big bank loan
that we can't pay.

Honesty.
Good.

People respond
to honesty.

I don't, but they do.

Max, you have potential here.

Caroline,
you're fired as a waitress.

Are you sure?

Stop!

There's nothing in there
to save you.

Well, if she's fired,
I'm fired, too.

Oh, relax,
Norma Rae.

She's fired
as a waitress,

but she's hired
as a hostess.

I am?
Why?

Because you're pretty,
you flashed a boob,

and you took more control
of Allie in five minutes

than anybody's been able to do
in her three rehab stints.

And that, lady,
is a New York City hostess.

Well, girls, I struck out.

Bill Cosby has ruined it
for all black men over 70

who are just trying
to buy a gal a drink.

Max, how do you like that?

I'm the hostess.
I got a promotion!

I don't think
a hostess is a promo--

It is, Max, 'cause with a
less-than-zero bank balance,

it has to be.
It's all I have left.

Hold up! Nobody leave.

Someone, and I'm not naming Max,

has been stealing from the diner.

Well, the diner has been stealing from me.

Youth, energy, will to live.

So new policy: before any employee leaves,

there will be a pat-down.

I tried to start that policy years ago.

Seriously, Han?

Is that really how you want to get

to second base for the first time?

It's not ideal, no.

Max, you're first.

Fine.

Feel me up, Low-bo-cop.

What's this?

It's a boob, sad man.

This, however, is bologna.

Shame on you! That's tomorrow's salmon.

While we're coming clean,

I stole your identity three years ago.

It's over now, but I was caught up

in a kind of Jason Bourne situation.

Caroline, I'm coming to you next.

And I thought this uniform

would be the worst thing
touching my body today.

Quick reminder: I'm a human being.

Caroline, literally slow your roll.

Well, if you're gonna hit bottom,

you better have something to wipe it with.

Earl...

Now, I know you are not

about to accuse a black man of stealing...

in this current political climate.

No, of course not.

I was just going to wish
you a wonderful evening.

Here, Max.

You can have my bologna.

And I just...

I think I love you.

I love you too.

Uh, Caroline?

Oh, good.

You brought someone else
with you to see that.

Owen, Caroline. Caroline, Owen.

Owen, bedroom. Caroline, later.

Owen, nice to meet you.

Do I detect a Philadelphia accent?

I haven't said anything yet.

But I gotta tell you, you really
took the cool out of Cool Whip.

Let's go in my room.

Oh, actually, Max, it's,
uh... it's kinda late.

I gotta be at work early.

But I had a good time. Good night.

I'll call you tomorrow. We'll do something.

Oh...

my...

God.

It finally happened.

Someone doesn't want to have sex with me!

He said he gotta be at work early.

Isn't that weird?

That you're dating a guy with a job?

Yeah, that is weird.

Max, maybe you finally met a guy

who wants to get to know you

before he jumps into bed with you.

Maybe Owen's the one.

The one that won't have sex with me!

So what happens around here

when nothing happens around here?

Well, when that's not happening,

cheesecake is a fun alternative.

I stole one from the diner 'cause I thought

you wouldn't be home and I'd be sad.

You hide that between your legs too?

Open up!

I smell cheesecake!

Oh. And you know...

And you know what that smells like.

Girl talk.

Girl talk?

All right, but if we lez
out, nobody catch feelings.

Eh, I'm just talking about
a little chick-ity chat.

You know, friends sharing with friends

in a completely safe environment.

Well, I've been having
this recurring dream...

Yeah, well, you'll have it again.

Let's talk about me.

Girls, Oleg and I have
been having a lot of sex.

You know, standing up, sitting down,

on a elevator, on a escalator.

Oh, yeah.

Going down and up at the same time.

All of that unprotected
sex, and still no baby.

Did you just come here to brag?

You know, Sophie,

sometimes when people have
trouble getting pregnant,

they see a doctor.

Sophie, where did you go?

I looked up from the
harness, and you were gone.

Well, Caroline thinks one of us...

Mmm.

And she's not pointing fingers at anyone,

but one of us...

you know, may need to get the sperm tested.

All right, but I've been
known to miss the cup.

All right, Earl.

After last night's date, I need a rebound.

I'm ready for you to set
me up with your friend.

He's dead.

I didn't say which friend.

They're all dead, Max.

Jeez, one guy doesn't
want to sleep with you,

and you're sweatin' to the oldies?

Flowers?

Oh, no! Am I dead too?

I'm looking for Max.

She said she doesn't work here.

What is he doing here?

It's so awkward seeing a guy

the day after he doesn't see you naked.

Hey.

These are for you.

Flowers?

For future reference, I'm more of a

"Mickey's Malt Liquor" kind of girl.

Hey, can we talk over there in that booth?

It depends. How's your immune system?

Caroline, cover my tables.

First I'll put these in some diner water.

I hope these flowers like
little floating meat bits.

So... you take me to dinner,

treat me like a lady,

and bring me flowers.

What kind of sick stuff are you into?

Max, I like you a lot.

Then why aren't you laying
on top of me somewhere?

Look, I want us to get to know each other

before we have sex

to be able to trust each other,

keep each other's secrets.

Fine; just tell me your
safe word, and let's go.

Mine is "pot sticker."

I'm serious,

'cause when we do have
sex, you're gonna find out

that I'm not...

well, I'm not regular down there.

Um... "not regular"?

So does it look something like...

This?

No. And bigger.

Uh, so something like...

This?

No, it doesn't have a face.

Max, something's wrong in the kitchen.

Not here. Nothing's wrong here.

Just come with me.

Uh, well, can I see you tomorrow?

Sure, but at least be late.

Give me something to work with.

I heard what he said.

What the heck does "not
regular down there" mean?

I don't know.

All I know is, it doesn't mean this.

It could be anything.

In Moscow, I saw this
amazing penis freak show,

"Ripleyvitch Believe It or Nyet."

I'm not over it "nyet."

So you're really gonna
go out with Owen again?

I mean, you're playing
penis roulette down there.

It could be gnarly or wonky or...

truly haunting.

You're right.

I gotta see it!

Okay, tell me again.

Talk to my like I'm a 10-year-old...

with overdeveloped boobs.

It's simple.

Owen just wants to get to know you

before he has sex with you.

That is sick! I'm ten.

Here. Let's practice.

Pretend I'm Owen, and ask me something.

So, Owen, when you gonna
take "Dem" pants off?

Hi, girls.

Do you think anyone would notice

if you closed your shop

and we had a girls' day tomorrow?

Where we going tomorrow, Sophie?

Say Coney Island, say Coney Island.

We're going to a gynecologist!

Yeah, see, Oleg said that
he'd get himself checked out,

so, to be a team player,

I'm gonna let a doctor
poke around my front bottom.

Well, obviously I'm honored,

but that's gonna be a hard "no" from me.

Oh, girls!

I don't want to go alone.

I'm scared!

You know, in Poland, our
doctor was also the butcher,

you know, because he
already had the white coat

and the metal draining table.

I mean, you try sharing a waiting room

with a bunch of nervous sheep.

Baaah!

Baaaah!

Sheep flashbacks?

I am obviously in.

Buh-bye.

This is the part where the sheep

really started to freak out.

Baaah!

Sophie, just relax,

and maybe change into this paper gown

so the doctor can have better access.

And as I'm saying this,

I really wonder what I am doing here.

Well, I don't need a gown.

I ripped the middle right out of my Spanx.

It's Owen.

"How about dinner tonight?

Italian, sushi, whatever
you're in the mood for."

I'm in the mood for a little...

Max, why don't you invite him over?

You can make him a romantic dinner,

and then you can watch

"American Horror Story: Penis Edition."

Miss Kuchenski, I'm Dr. Surden.

Baaah!

Miss Kuchenski, why
aren't you wearing a gown,

and why are you clenching your knees?

Oh, no.

I got the lock legs.

Hang on; I got an idea.

That tickles!

Make your move now, Doc!

That tickles!

Baaah!

Uh, m-m-maybe I'll have the nurse

bring something to relax you.

I'll take a water if we're getting stuff.

I got to get out of here.

But, Sophie, he hasn't
even examined you yet.

What's going on?

You're acting odd-er than usual.

Well, what if Oleg and I can't have a baby

because there's something wrong with me?

I mean, what if it's not Oleg's swimmers?

What if it's my pool?

I mean, that would be so...

sad.

Here's how I want things to unfold.

Do you think his thing will unfold?

Like Beetlejuice?

Do you think you can
handle getting to know him?

I'm getting really upset.

Hey, I have questions prepared.

I'll be fine.

You're the one who has to sit at Starbucks

and listen to homeless
Barb pitch her screenplay

for the next three hours.

Uh, careful.

I've got a producer credit on that.

Max, your package is here.

Hey.

Hope you like white wine.

Of course. I live with her.

And "her" is leaving.

Nice to see you, Owen.

You two have a great time
getting to know each other.

Don't let this one talk your ear off.

She's the type of girl
that just loves to talk.

You look beautiful.

You went to all this trouble.

I did. Thank you.

And you look...

man-beautiful.

Shall we sit and get to know each other?

Like, for instance,

"Your wife's work friend Gary

"invites her away on a business trip

"where they'd be sharing one room.

Do you, A... ".

- Max.
- I know.

Obviously, she bones him.

When I said "get to know each other".

I wasn't thinking "Scruples".

I'm more of a "Hungry Hungry Hippos" guy.

I wish I could afford "Scruples."

This is "Scrumples."

Look, I don't know how to do this.

I feel stupid.

You may feel stupid,

but you look really cute right now.

I do?

How cute do I look?

A, super very a lot.

B...

Oh, it's A.

Seriously, have you never
gotten to know anybody ever?

I...don't know.

How do people get to know each other?

I mean, what do you want to know?

We didn't have any money growing up.

My mom was an alcoholic.

My father was...

not able to be located by Maury Povich.

We moved a lot because

the parking brake on our house didn't work.

So now you know me.

I guess you'll be leaving.

Was that an A, kiss good-bye?

That's for being cute and for sharing that.

I definitely think we should skip dinner...

blow this out 'cause I worry about fire;

that's something about me...

and go straight to dessert.

Is it weird that I want to talk now?

Oh, wow.

Going right for it, huh?

Wow.

Never would've drawn that.

I can't believe you won't tell me

what's not regular about
Owen's "down there".

I tell you everything.

Fine.

Meet me at the first coleslaw tub.

Come alone.

- Get out.
- But I'm cooking.

Get out.

Fine. This is garbage anyway.

Okay, okay. Tell me.

All right.

Remember on "Full House,"

when you thought there was one Michelle,

but there were actually two Michelles...

Why are you bringing up

one of the craziest days of my life?

He has two.

Two what?

Owen has two penises!

Why is it so hard to understand?

Is that a thing that can happen?

Yes. It's called diphallia.

I just Googled it.

It's a medical condition in which a male

is born with two penises.

The only case in which
two dongs make a right.

Oleg, this was supposed to be private.

I think you mean "privates."

What's the ball count?

Oleg, stop Googling!

I'm not Googling.

Now I'm on the phone with Sophie.

Who has two penises?

Max's boyfriend.

What's going on back here?

Max's boyfriend has two penises!

Okay! Okay! That's it.

No more talk about Owen's penis

or his other penis.

Well, Max, I guess he's not the one...

'cause he's the two.

Actually, I really like him,

and not just because I
can cheat on him with him.

Max, you can't be serious.

Hey, everyone has
something wrong with them.

I'm messed up on the inside.

At least Owen's is right out there

where you can see it.

Owen's stopping by just to chat.

I like talking now.

I think I'm gonna tell him

about the first time I ran away from home.

I crawled to Detroit.

Max, I think it's great you were able

to look past Owen's situation.

Even the sight of one of
them can be disturbing.

Hey, everybody!

Oh, good news.

Oleg's got strong sperm.

Well, that's the end of this cookie.

And the bad news is...

Oh, I thought that was the bad news.

I went back to the doctor, and he said

I can still get pregnant.

It's just gonna take a while, you know,

'cause my eggs are a bit like
the eggs here at the diner.

You know, not exactly bad,

just real close to the use-by date.

Sophie, what made you
go back to the doctor?

Well, you know, I was doing
a lot of soul-searching,

and I left my purse there.

So I figured, you know, while I'm here,

why not take a look, you know?

I mean, like Max said,
everybody's got something.

Well, not to brag,

but mine's got two somethings.

Hi. I'm here for, uh...

Table for two. I mean one!

Why did I say two?

I don't know. Have a good one.

You too. I mean, one!

Oh, hi. Yeah.

I've heard a lot about you.

You know, but not everything.

You know, just a couple of things.

- She knows?
- What?

Um, no.

This is like meeting Elvis

if Elvis had two penises
and didn't die on his toilet.

Okay. They all know.

Owen, wait! Wait. I'm sorry.

Uh, I expected him to walk differently.

Did anybody else think that?

Yeah, I was wondering if
he wears briefs and boxers.

I was wondering if he'd let
me take a selfie with them.

Guys, Max really likes Owen,

and she might have blown it.

Which, again, seems like a lot of work.

What happened?

He broke up with me.

He broke up with you?

He said I betrayed his trust,

and I said, whether I like it or not,

you guys know everything.

You're part of the package.

And what did he say?

He said my package was too much for him.

Your package is too much?

I mean, he's driving a double-Decker.

Coleslaw tub. Come alone.

Are you okay?

I'm fine.

I don't really believe you,

but I do know something that
might make you feel better.

Oh, God! No!

No more girl talk.

Private stash.

I get sad a lot in here.

I really liked him.

I did what you said,

and I let him get to know me.

I'm never doing that again.

This isn't doing it for me.

I'm gonna miss him.

Ladies and waitresses,

I am the great Han-dini!

Somewhere there's
a top of a wedding cake

missing its groom.

I went to traffic school
this weekend

and was taught by a magician.

My traffic school
was taught by a comedian.

It wasn't funny,
but at least I saw

what Jon Lovitz was up to.

Did you get a DWI?

Driving while itty-bitty?

(laughs)

I ran a series of red lights.

I received word there had been
a Squirtle sighting.

And now, I'm about
to pull a rabbit

-out of a hat.
-Big deal.

I just pulled half a raccoon
out of the toilet.

Presto!

This is making me depressed-o.

Where are you?

(bell dings)

Pick up.

Salad with a rabbit on it.

He just can't serve a salad
without a hare in it.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Amazing news:

I found a penny.

And our dessert bar
is in Time Out Magazine.

(gasps) Whoa!
"Where are they now?

Pizza Rat!"

Not that.
Our piece is right here

next to this Walking Dead ad.

Oh, wait,
that's Michael Douglas.

So, the walking dead.

"Former scandal queen
Caroline Channing's

cozy Brooklyn dessert bar,
M&C's, that's beaut--"

"Caroline Channing's
dessert bar"?

This place isn't like
your sex life, Caroline.

You're not doing it
all by yourself.

I don't even do it
by myself anymore.

I was talking too much,

and, look, I mentioned you
right here.

"Partner."

I'm more than just the partner,

I'm the creative inspiration.

I'm Steve Jobs
and you're the fat guy

that drives a Segway.

I tried to include you.

I told you
the interview was on Monday,

and you said
that's your whippit night.

Oh, I whipped it.

Whipped it good.

Caroline, back that ass up.

I don't want anyone
too close to my baby.

Is that why you dipped her
in perfume?

I want everyone
to treat little Barbara

like Mariah Carey

and never look
directly in her eyes.

Is that why
she's wearing sunglasses?

I just got off.

And also, I'm done with work.

Okay.

There's my girls.

We're not your girls, Oleg.

I have it in writing
from a judge.

Oleg, give her some space.

Her spray tan
hasn't even dried yet.

Sophie, I've been reading
a parenting blog called

"So, You've Ruined Your Life,"

and they say it's very important
for a dad to bond with his baby.

I think that's only true
for human dads.

Maybe you can
bond with the baby later.

You know,
like, when she has a baby.

I can't wait 12 years.

Sophie, I'm her father.

I helped make her.

This wasn't
a Virgin Marski situation.

There was nothing immaculate
about this conception.

Well, the fun part's over now.

Yeah, she's mine.

Excuse you.

(thumping and clattering)

She's getting really good
with that thing.

I'm gonna do what I do
when all women tell me

not to be near them.

I'm gonna follow her.

Uh, Caroline Channing?

Hi, I'm Doug Reynolds,
I'm a professor at Wharton.

Hey, I went to Wharton.

Yeah, I know.

I saw your interview
in Time Out.

You mentioned it several times.

Once when you were asked

where the dessert bar
was located.

Well, it is east of Wharton.

You haven't heard
her Wharton song.

* Wharton, Wharton,
Wharton, Wharton *

* Wharton, Wharton, Wharton
Wharton, Wharton *

Yeah, it's not a great song,

but the story about
how you built your business

from the ashes
of your father's infamy,

that's inspiring.

You're the business world's
Rudy.

Well, now you're just
quoting me.

Hi, I'm "Partner."

Howdy, Partner.
(chuckles)

Hey, I teach a business class
over at Penn

because the stock market crashed
in 2008.

I would love it
if both of you would come

and talk to the students.

Like a scared-straight thing?

Not the pen.

Penn,
the University of Pennsylvania.

-That's where Wharton is.
-Hmm.

If you'd listen
to my whole song,

you'd hear it
in the third verse.

We'd pay for your train
to Philadelphia

and campus housing.

-Ooh.
-We'd love to come.

Right, partner?

And my parole officer,

mother,
guidance counselor,

and the state of Rhode Island

said I'd never go to college.

I can get your email
from the website.

I'll send you the info.

We have a site?

I hope there are no nudies
of me on it

'cause Larry Flynt owns
the rights to my image.

-You know what this means?
-Uh...

(both) * Wharton, Wharton,
Wharton, Wharton, Wharton *

* Wharton, Wharton, Wharton,
Wharton, Wharton, Wharton... *

One bong or two?

Max, this is a business trip.

We're not going to Comic-Con
with Woody Harrelson.

Wait, is that on the table?

Anyway, this is your trip

for the dessert bar.

So again, one bong or two?

I am never gonna live down
the "partner" thing, am I?

Like when I threw away those
bath salts to save your life.

(scoffs)
I wasn't gonna eat your face.

I am not having this argument
with you again.

I'm not mad
about the partner thing.

I'm excited to go to college.
I already told Randy,

and he's gonna send me
a care package.

Emphasis on the package.

I broke up
with my high school boyfriend

when I went to college
just to keep my options open.

Pfft, you're in Time Out
 New York with Pizza Rat.

What's that loser doing now?

It was Mark Zuckerberg.

Just tell me about
the parties at college

'cause that's
the only reason I'm going.

Oh,

they were epic.

You know what they say,

if you remember
the parties at Wharton,

you weren't there.

You weren't here, were you?

-No.
-Okay.

But some of those
all-night study sessions

got pretty punchy.

Like whackadoo.

You're making me punchy
right now.

(knocks on door)

Hey, girls,

Oleg isn't here, is he?

Do you hear us screaming
"get out" or "put that away"?

He keeps wanting
to bond with the baby.

Why can't he be more like
the men in Poland?

Why can't he be in Poland
is my question.

I mean, they wouldn't even be in
the same room as their baby girl

until it was time
to sell her off.

You know, my father's
first words to me were,

"Next item up for bid."

I can't believe I'm saying this,

but Oleg's not wrong here.

He's wrong, literally,
everywhere else.

(knocks on door)

Oh, it must be Oleg.

-Hide us.
-Hide you?

That carriage can be seen
from space.

All right, tell Oleg
I'm definitely not in the barn.

Yeah, now,

I'm gonna be in the barn.

This is where we put up
grad students

and occasional guest lecturers

who are too poor
to stay in a hotel.

Losers.

You guys got any towels?

You'll have to forgive Max.

She's just excited to be here.

We know, obviously,
there'll be a bath sheet

and a hand towel for each of us.

Right?

And here's your bedroom.

I'm the RA,
but don't worry,

I'm not super uptight.

Just no noise after 10:00
or I'll come at you hard.

You'll have no problems from us.

I was an RA
when I went to school here.

I'm Caroline Channing.

The.

Caroline Channing?

You're Buzzkill Channing?

I knew Caroline wasn't
your real name.

You're the most legendary RA
we've ever had.

I heard you once threw a kid
out of a second-story window.

That's just a myth,

but a hookah pipe
did take flight.

(laughs)

And I was a hookah

by the airport.

Well, it's an honor
to have your here, Buzzkill.

I'm gonna have to search
your trash bag before you leave.

Everything good's gonna be
in my butt.

She's fun.

Okay, let's unpack,

get our shower buckets
organized.

I'm unpacked.
Let's go par-tois.

How many flasks do you have?

I already took two away
from you.

Now, you be the audience.

I need to practice my speech
for tomorrow.

We need to party.

Tonight needs to end
with us driving a police car

into a fountain on the quad
or it is a fail.

I am not here to party.

I am here to--
to show people

with determination
and perspiration,

you can become an inspiration.

Max, what do you think of that?

Max?

Max?

I'm not organizing
your shower bucket.

(door opens)

Caroline, are you awake?

No.

It's cool, she's up.
Come on in.

(indistinct chatter)

(gasps)
Who are these people?

I'm sorry, but we had
to leave the bar.

The roof was on fire.

At first we thought
the DJ was just

getting the party started,
but it actually was.

Anyway, we'll try not
to keep it down.

(indistinct chatter)

Okay, who's next?
I washed it out.

Nobody else
throw up in this thing.

I mean it.

After I crush this,

you wanna come back
to my dorm room?

I have a junior suite.

You're sweet, Junior.

but I have a boyfriend
who could be your father.

He also could be my father,
I've never met the man.

Uh, Buzzkill, 3:00.

Just a minute, young man.

There is no underage drinking
here.

This is college.

(cell phone ringing)

Hello?

Oh, hi, Oleg.

I lost Sophie again.

She's like
a sexy set of car keys.

(gasps)
Hey!

No random,
uncommitted sex here.

This is college.

I have a computer full of videos
that says you're wrong.

CAROLINE (over phone):
Oleg, I can't talk now.

I have my own problems.
I don't know where the RA is,

so I've had to step up.

We're like the Marines
of no funny business.

(gasps)
That better not be a joint.

(sniffs)
Yeah, that's a doobie, brother.

Sophie won't even
let me feed Barbara.

She says fathers aren't equipped
for the job.

Well, she does have a point.
You don't have boobs.

Anyone ever tell you
you're a real buzzkill?

(gasps)
I have to go.

I hear zippers unzipping.

Were you just on the phone
with Poison Control?

Because I told you,
Steve's gonna be fine.

See?
Breathing, I think.

Now take off your top
and shotgun a beer with me.

Max, my speech is tomorrow,

and this top gets
a lot of compliments.

I just want you
to have fun at college for once.

Can you do that for me?

I do things for you
all the time.

You remember when
I told your date

it was Chestnut that farted.

Fine.

If I have one drink,
will you roll Steve out of here

and get everyone to leave?

all: (chanting)
Buzzkill!

(electronic music playing)

-Whoo!
all: (cheering)

Who's the buzzkill now, bitches?

(cheering)

Ah...

corrupting dorks
is meaningful work.

Who wants to see me
pretend bang Steve again?

(cheering)

Do it for real!

(laughs)

Caroline, what are you doing?

You of all people should know,

you can't have a party here.

This is college.

Pfft, get off my back, narc.

Ooh, who's this?

My fiancÃ©.

Guess we gotta make it even.

*

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God,
I love College Caroline

so much more
than all other Carolines.

*

(exhales)
Damn, college is fun.

I'm glad I went.

Oh, no, I'm late!

That's impossible.
You haven't had sex in years.

Also, you look like
an Italian grandmother.

(gasps and screams)
Oh, my God!

Who did this to me?

This was the compromise.

They wanted to shave your head.

(gasps)

I am still a little drunk,

and I forget
what was in my speech,

and I look like
a very pretty Burt Reynolds

and this is all your fault!

Is the implication here
that Burt Reynolds isn't pretty?

Yes, it is my fault
for forcing you

to have the time of your life

and make out with those dudes.

Max, you don't even--

dudes?

Plural?

How many dudes?

I lost count
after the third Chet.

I can't believe
you did this to me.

It was more like
you doing it to them.

Max, I am serious right now.
(exhales sharply)

Calm down, Luigi.

(exhales)
Max, I know you were mad

about the Time Out interview
and the "partner" thing,

but I can't believe
you sabotaged me on purpose.

Okay, first of all,

I don't think about you
that much.

I am sorry
I didn't give you credit,

but ruining this for me
is so much worse.

This was gonna be my comeback.

I wasn't mad.

You were the only one
upset about it.

I don't care about that stuff.

Honestly, I just wanted you
to have a good time.

I didn't need
to have a good time.

I needed to make people jealous.

Who's gonna be
jealous of me now?

Guys that can't
grow facial hair?

Look, you were great at school

and last night you were great
at having fun at school.

You're lucky.
I have last night,

but I'll never get to have both.

What're you talking about?

You're the smart one.

You deserve
your moment of triumph,

but you also deserve
not to be Buzzkill Channing

for the rest of your life.

You really weren't mad
about the interview?

A little,

but I'm always
a little mad at you.

I'm sorry
if I screwed things up.

You don't have to be.

I really did have fun, Max.

See if you like the googly-eyes
I drew around your nipples.

Fun how they go
in different directions.

Sorry we're late.

I had to scrub the googly-eyes
off my--

bicycle traffic.

Well, let's get started.

I'm supposed to have lunch
with my son, Steve.

We had a little fight last night
before he left for a party.

If anything ever happened
to him, I'd be devastated.

Praying for a different Steve.

Wow, you made out with half
the people in this room.

I'm pretty sure you got
one of the Chets pregnant.

Caroline Channing is
an alumni of Wharton,

and also the brains behind

a thriving new dessert bar
in Brooklyn,

and she is here
to tell us how she did it.

Oh, also, um, whoever
keeps writing "wash me"

in the back of my car,
there's no R in wash.

Caroline.

It is a great honor
to be here today.

I learned a lot
at this fine institution.

Hard work, integrity,

a lot of math I'll never use.

There are
a lot of smart people here,

but the smartest person I know,

I met waiting tables in a diner.

Max, turn around.

The other way.

And I am proud
to call her my partner.

(coughs)
Gay.

This woman is
the reason I'm here today.

She should be giving the speech
because she's how I did it.

Her name is Max Black.

(light applause)

Um, what're you doing?
You're leaving?

They're jealous enough,

and I want you
to have your moment.

You should get to have both too.

And also, chug-chug
has to puke-puke.

And, uh, all right...

I didn't go to college,

but after spending
some time here,

I think I could teach you
a few things.

Beer...

before liquor,

never sicker.

Liquor before beer,

never fear.

And weed before
and after everything.

Also, pimps up, hos down.

Never...

get high on your own supply,

and, most importantly,

shake ya ass,

but watch yourself.

You should be taking notes.
This'll be on the midterm.

Well, like most people
straight out of college,

I'm at a job
I don't wanna be at.

That's right.

She went back and got her degree
in "Make-out Slut."

And we may have killed a guy.

I may have too.

I drove here without my glasses.

You know, in Poland,
girls don't go to college.

They drop them in a lake,

and whoever doesn't drown
is a witch.

Doesn't that make you a witch,
Sophie?

No comment.

If it isn't Magic No-Johnson.

Pick a card,
and don't show me what it is.

Don't worry, I'll hold it
well above four feet.

Whatever puts the card
in your hands, toots.

Was this your card?

Nope, it was
the Queen of Hearts.

Oh, my God,

Han's a witch too!

Drown him!

I did it.

What hell have I unleashed?

Whatever it is,
keep it in your training pants.

I should have just
done traffic school online,

but, no, Han wanted
to meet people.

Sophie,

I think I found the solution
to all our problems.

(gasps)

Microwave in the headboard?

I've told you repeatedly,

the science
just isn't there yet.

Make sure I get an email

when it is there.

This is about us

and Barbara.

I want to be more involved.

That's why I got these.

Moobs...

To feed Barbara with.

Great, now I'm jealous
of Oleg's rack.

If he puts Dr. Pepper in there,
so am I.

Oleg,

tell me you kept your ding-dong.

Oh, yeah.

I'm just Mrs. Doubtfiring it
for the time being.

We've gotta get that kid
out of that house.

Well, you know what, Barbara?

You're really lucky
to have such a good father.

I guess I have been
bogarting baby Barbara.

Yeah, it really is sweet
that you did that, Oleg.

My eyes are up here, Caroline.

We're out of milk
in the kitchen.

I really hope Earl milking Oleg

is our rock bottom.

It won't be.

(cash register bell dings)

(upbeat music)

*

I know I've been talking about
Bobby all morning,

but another thing I love
about Bobby is,

he just gets me.

Can he come get you right now?

Last night, I gave Bobby
a little neck action.

Neck action?
Oh, racy!

What's next, you gonna
lift up your skirt

and show him your knees?

Maybe.

Hey, Caroline, wait up!

(gasps)
Hide me, Max.

Bobby hasn't seen me

in my waitress uniform,
or my right profile.

It hasn't been easy.

What is wrong with our uniform?

I call her Carrie

'cause she's got
a little pig's blood on her

and she can't be
destroyed by fire.

Morning, beautiful.

I got you a macchiato.

And a supportive
round of applause

when I told them
the name was Caroline.

(chuckles)

Bobby, you are so sweet.

This has skim milk, right?

Oh, whatever!

Uh, why are you using Max
as a human shield?

Oh, don't worry.
I'm used to it.

It's how my mom robbed
all those Carvels in the '90s.

(all laughing)

I should get going.

So...group hug?

I'm still trying
to figure out

where to take you
on our third date.

I want it to be special.

Also, I'm either caught
on Max's button

or she has a tiny, round penis.

(grunts)

Might want to get
that jacket tested.

I'll see ya.

Third date?

You know what that means,
don't you?

Going by my last third date,

he comes out of the closet,

and we still date
for two years.

No!

It means more neck action,
just lower.

Your between-legs neck.

You're an adult, Max.

It's called a noony-noo.

And I thought sex
was on the tenth date,

after he accidentally
says, "I love you."

Everybody knows
the third date means sex.

And the fourth date means
he gets oddly distant

and crazy busy at work.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Hey, Earl, how's it hanging?

Lower than anyone
will tell you, Max.

I thought a snake followed me
into the bathroom this morning.

What's up with you girls?

Oh, Caroline is going
on a third date.

Oh, some between-legs neck
action is on.

I am really not
familiar with this phrase.

And I'm pretty sure this
whole "third date sex" rule

isn't really a thing.

Waiting until
the third date for sex?

What are you, a nun?

Hey, everybody!

Oh, all right.

Don't talk to Baby Barbara.
We're in a fight.

She thought that
the Fifty Shades book

was better than the movie.

Sophie, have you ever heard
that you're supposed to

have sex on the third date?

Oh, that's a nun thing, right?

I am so glad I don't
have to deal with

this kind of stuff anymore.

I am officially retired
from sex.

Not sure how many of you
have heard the news,

but not sure how many
of you read "Juggs."

It got too political.

That's why I turned to "Cans."

Max, what are you talking about?

You can't retire from sex.

It's your thing,
like Cheetos

or zeroing in
on people's vulnerabilities.

What? Sorry, I was distracted
by your nose pimple.

I just feel like I need
to get out of the game.

I had a good run, just ask

literally anybody.

But now it's your turn.

Well, when one pair
of legs closes,

another one opens.

Yeah, that's what
Polish Oprah says.

And you get hanged
if you disagree with her.

Yep.

Max, it doesn't take a genius--

although my Facebook IQ test
says I qualify as one--

to know that this
whole retirement thing

is about your breakup
with Randy.

It also said you had
362 friends.

And we all know
you barely have one.

This has nothing to do
with Randy.

My sex throne is yours now.

I would maybe put a towel down.

Max, you can't get
out of the game

just when I'm getting back in.

I wanted us to
have sex together.

Well, clear up that nose zit,
and we'll talk.

Speaking of nose zits.

Han, Max is about to
give up sex.

Tell her how bad
life is without it.

It's actually quite rich.

I was just saying to Mossimo
down at the boccie court--

Thank you!
I rest my case.

And tomorrow
I'm taking golf lessons

thanks to our community board.

Apparently, I don't
meet the weight minimum

for Krav Maga.

You know what?
I'll go with you.

Retired people love golf.

Just like you lesbians.

Welcome to the club.

Oh, look, we just
made a golf pun.

This is gonna be fun!

I hope to God you know
what you're doing.

If I am gonna have sex with
Bobby, I need new underwear.

My current pair has more holes
than the plot of Arrival.

So you came here?

There's no lube aisle.

None of the mannequins
are doing each other.

This is a classy lingerie store,

not Second-Hand Hose.

I got kicked out of there.

I ate a pair of edible underwear

and I put the box
back on the shelf.

Ladies, I'm Rita.
Welcome to the Art of Seduction,

where seduction begins with--

A shot of tequila

and ends with a shot
of penicillin?

Not what I was
going to say at all.

What can I help you ladies with?

Uh, she has a third date
situation happening.

Do you have anything
that says "Grand Reopening"?

I want to be naughty.

But I get cold.

I found your shoelace section,
but where is the underwear?

That is underwear,

and you're holding it backwards.

Oh, sure, I see it now.

Let's go to Target.

And, uh, what about you?

Any third dates coming up?

Actually, no.

I am retired, sexually.

Took the sock off the door
and now I'm wearing it.

Come on, Max,
we both know you're not

really retired from sex.

We are two young, sexual beings.

Where are you
supposed to wear this?

That's a purse.

Uh, if I'm not retired,

then why did Larry Flynt
send me a gold watch,

thanking me for
my 20 years of cervix.

How about this teddy?

I just need simple underwear.

I was a nice presentation
for my noony-noo.

Look, it doesn't matter
what you wear.

With a body like yours,
it's not gonna be on long.

Ah, see, Max?
She likes my body.

Tastes have changed since
I got out of the game.

And these panties
are great to bounce in.

The frills on the back
really accentuate the twerk

when you're doing
the Swingin' Linda.

(popping sounds)

Linda

must have a bunch of
back problems.

Oh, my God.
Do I have to do that?

Whatever happened to lying down?

That's a guy's job now.

Skanks like us
ruined that for you.

She's not wrong, but

I teach a burlesque class
around the corner.

You should come.

It can, uh, really help you
get in touch with your body.

Oh, it's okay, I'm already

very in touch with my body.

Oh, yeah.
She's real in touch.

This one's keeping
Duracell in business.

Max, I wish you had gotten
something at the lingerie store.

That saddle looked
really good under you.

MAX: Most things do.

Did!
I'm retired!

We both know your retirement
isn't gonna last.

You're like The Rolling Stones,

but with more of your own blood.

MAX: Oh...

really?

Do I look like someone who will

ever have sex again?

(gasps)

Clothes jinx!

It's like looking
in a funhouse mirror.

Without the fun.

I just came by to say our
tee time is tomorrow at 1:00.

We're in a foursome
with Mitch and Bill.

Whatever you do, don't mention
the Gulf War in front of Mitch.

Even when you say "golf,"
really hit the O.

Max, come on,
don't you want to unretire

and have a real foursome again?

Like you used to, on my bed,

while I'm trying to read?

I like this sexless existence.

I don't know what you've
been complaining about.

And besides, I can
finally let myself go,

hygenital-ly.

So because you got
hurt by Randy,

you're never
gonna have sex again?

No, I'm never having sex again

because I have no idea
how to take off these pants.

-Hey.
-Whoa--Bobby!

What are you doing here?

I couldn't wait
till tomorrow night to see you.

I got this from a gay wedding;
they were throwing them out

'cause they were
the wrong shade of red.

My God, this is
just like The Bachelor.

Except I'm not getting HPV
from a lagoon.

Hey, don't worry, Max.
I didn't forget you.

(gasps)
My scratch-offs!

The grooms were throwing those
out instead of rice.

Well, that's
going on my Pinterest.

So tomorrow night's
our big third date.

That's what people
keep telling me.

I've got something
real special planned.

It's exotic.

I think you'll
be very impressed.

Oh, I'm sure I will be,

but it takes me a little while,

and I'm quiet when I am.

Hey, don't worry.

I'll do all the work.

Well, I'll pitch in a little.

It's gonna be big.

See you tomorrow night.

Big and exotic?
What is it, a parrot?

If it's a cockatiel,
then I'm back in the game.

At least I have
that really sexy underwear.

Hey, girls.
I heard the word "underwear."

Hey. (laughs)

Some old lady left
her panties back here.

Oleg, those aren't
old lady panties,

they're mine.

Are you bringing them
to an old lady?

Perhaps this gentleman's wife?

Oleg, these are sexy.

What makes you a panty expert?

Besides my official
license plate

from the state of arousal

and my degree from Idu U?

Nothing.

I have to go to
that burlesque class.

I don't know,
you should see if

they have night classes
at Idu U.

How are you gonna dance
in those golf clothes?

How are you gonna dance

looking like a slutty poodle?

Let's just pick out our props.

I've been sanitizing
for this all morning.

I was once dropped into a lake
in a trunk just like this.

Those dock goons did not
expect to see this gal again.

Ooh, feather boa!

I haven't worn
something with feathers

since that pigeon
flew into our fan.

I brought this from home.

I got it on my third
Carnival Cruise.

Oh, let her have it!

Girl's going on a third date.

Ooh, that's a gay first date.

My first date
was a Hall & Oates concert.

Yes, I'm old.

Welcome, everyone!

Let's get started.
It's time to get sexy!

Yep, according to
my "Hustler" watch,

it's 11:69.

Can't be right.
Feels earlier.

Hey, girls.
Oh.

I was screaming at you

for three blocks to wait up.

But then sidewalk Caroline
turned out to be a lamppost.

Sophie, what are you doing here?

Well, I saw the card
on the board in the diner,

and I wanted to spice up
Oleg and my sex life.

Yeah, I mean, we haven't
done it in front of

The Today Show window
in weeks.

I can't believe they didn't

cut away when
Matt Lauer threw up.

Last time I did it, you could

still bring cocaine
in your carry-on.

In this class,
we are going to go deep

and unleash
our sexual goddesses.

Mine got me kicked out
of the army.

They asked; I told.

Let's dive in!

Everybody get
behind your chairs.

I'm gonna show you the routine
and then I'll break it down.

I'm so excited.

I'm about to lose control

and I think I like it!

(Rihanna's "Birthday Cake"
playing over stereo)

* It's not even my birthday

* But he want to
lick the icing off *

* I know you want it
in the worst way *

* Can't wait to
blow my candles out *

* He want that cake, cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake, cake *

* It's not even my birthday
but-- *

You know what?

I don't need to have sex.

I'll just play golf with you.

Uh, I play golf
to get away from my wife.

Well, I'm exhausted.

I need a nap.

After I dance is when we
usually lose most of the class.

Now, before I teach you
the actual moves,

I want you to just
feel your body

and let it go.

Who wants to give it a shot?

Oh, I do! I do!

I want to put
the "ass" in "class."

Sophie, if I wanted
to see your ass,

I'd get up early
and watch The Today Show.

(Rihanna's
"Birthday Cake" plays)

* Baby, baby, baby

* It's not even my birthday

* But he want to
lick the icing off *

* I know you want it
in the worst way *

* Can't wait to
blow my candles out *

I'm stuck, but you know what?

I swear to God,
I can make it work.

* It's not even my birthday

* But he want to
lick the icing off *

(music stops)

I'm, uh, scared to ask this,

but who's next?

Is it okay if I try?

That was probably
the only act I could follow.

Go, girl!

(Rihanna's
"Birthday Cake" plays)

* Baby, baby, baby

* It's not even my birthday

* But he want to
lick the icing off *

* I know you want it
in the worst way *

* Can't wait to blow
my candles out *

* He want that cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake, cake, cake *

* It's not even my birthday

(music stops)

I didn't think these pants
came with a boner.

I don't know where
that came from.

You know how they say
the rhythm is gonna get you?

It got me!

Well, I gotta go.

It's ass past two.

Well, your ass
isn't getting past me.

Ooh, now that I can dance,

I'm sassy too.

Let's tease.
And tease.

Did I do that?
Did I do that?

And tease.
And tease.

I did do that.
I did do that.

RITA: And pump.
And grind.

And pump.
And grind.

Wink.

That's how I got
to this country.

Except I was also rowing.

(music stops)

Why aren't you participating?

Like I told that guy
in sweatpants last week,

you can't just
sit here and watch.

Well, unlike that guy,

my days of sexy moves
are behind me.

From now on, the only balls
I'll be smacking

are on the golf course.

You're really gonna give up
on who you are

because of Randy?

She went through a breakup,

and she swore off sex,

and I'm worried maybe deodorant.

Oh, yeah, that's

probably my bag of dirty diapers
in my purse.

I'm putting them
in my baby book.

This is what this class
is all about.

Taking all that pain and anger

and making it sexy.

I thought this was about
making my booty clap.

We'll get there, Gavin.

So tell me about
this guy, Randy.

Uh, there's nothing to say.

It's not about him.

Are you sure?

Did he

bring you down low?

Oh, sure he did.
Real low.

Shake you up?

All shook up.

Hey, get your ass
out of my face, razor hips.

Did he

spin you around

and slide right out
of your life?

Like a greasy McNugget!

Show me that nugget.

I would, but I can't

take these pants off.

Max, come on.

You can't let one bad experience
ruin everything.

Otherwise, I'd never use
our bath mat again.

It's hot for no reason.

Yeah, I'm double parked!
Come on, dance already!

Fine!
If it will get me out of here.

(Rihanna's
"Birthday Cake" plays)

* It's not even my birthday

* But he want to
lick the icing off *

That's right,
get it out there!

Bump, bump!
Grind, grind!

Duck, duck, goose!
Wink!

* Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake

* Cake, cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake, cake *

Ooh, yeah,
bounce, baby, bounce!

God, this is so real!

* I know you want it
in the worst way *

(music stops)

Okay! Fine!

Maybe I am shut down
'cause of Randy.

See, you needed to get that out.
Do you feel better?

No, I got a splinter
in my face.

Well, if you'll excuse me,

I have a golf lesson
to get to.

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle,
wiggle, Max out.

She won't tell anyone

she learned those moves here,
will she?

I was the best, right?

Because it matters to me.

Hide your husbands.
Hide your wives.

Max is back.

I'm out of retirement

and these pants, as soon as
I can get them off.

Oh, my God, you slept with Han?

Let me find that
machete you gave me

in case this ever happened.

No, she slept with our golf pro.

Once again, I was left
holding my putter.

Yep, I'm back, and
I have the grass stains

on my head to prove it.

See?
That class helped everyone.

Except Sophie--
by the time I left,

she had three more
chairs on her.

Hey, everybody!

Brace yourself.

Sophie got sexified.

(Rihanna's
"Birthday Cake" plays)

* Baby, baby, baby

* It's not even my birthday

* But he want to
lick the icing off *

* I know you want it
in the worst way *

* Can't wait to
blow my candles out *

* He want that cake, cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake, cake *

* Cake, cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake, cake *

Oh, my God.

Between those moves
and that sexy neck brace,

it's too much for me to take.

This is what I get
for telling that genie

I wanted to live to be 100.

* Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake, cake *

* Cake, cake, cake

* It's not even my birthday

* But he want to
lick the icing off *

Sophie...

could I see you
in the walk-in freezer?

And if you don't mind,
could you add a limp?

* Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake, cake *

* It's not even my birthday

You know what the sexiest
thing about it is?

The limp is real.

Hey, buddy.

-Hey.
-What's going on, man?

Bobby!

Hey, I was just
on my lunch break,

thought I'd stop by
and almost see you.

Well, it was nice dating you.

This is my uniform.
I know, it's...

Hot.
Really, really hot.

You look like a sexy pencil.

But I bought all this
really sexy,

very zipper-heavy underwear
to wear on our third date.

Why would I see your underwear
on our third date?

Doesn't that happen
on the tenth?

That's what I said!

You people are animals!

But what was all that talk about

our date being big and exotic?

I was gonna take you
to this Moroccan place.

They don't have chairs.
We sit on pillows.

That is exotic.

You might want to
hold off on the sex.

You two might be related.

(upbeat rock music)

(cash register bell dings)

Max, what is all this?

I thought we were running fancy
purchases past each other

since you yelled at me
for splurging on two-ply.

You might as well wipe with
dollar bills, your royal heinie.

This is for
a big cake order I got

from Over-Eaters Anonymous.

And, like it's members,
it's a big 'un.

I thought we didn't take
special orders anymore

since we opened the dessert bar.

You know, like how girls
stop doing mouth stuff

after they get a ring.

Which is why
I don't give girls rings.

They're having a group cheat day
and I wanna help them.

It's my way of giving nothing.

Max, that's terrible.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ugh, there's no room
on our side.

Han's side is empty though.

Just like his Little People,
 Big World viewing parties.

I went once.

Oh, Han left another note

Again, not enough alcohol.

"I'd really appreciate

if you kept your supplies
on your--"

Wow, his notes are more boring

than your "remember
when I had money" stories.

Come on, Max.
We're slamming Han.

Let's stay focused.

Remember when I had money,
though?

I'm crafting
my response to Han right now.

I wanna keep it light.

(gasps)
Did I ever tell you

we actually had a money room

like in Richie Rich comics?

-Yep.
-Hello, girls.

Read anything good lately?

Perhaps a note
on stationary that says,

"From the desk
of a jelly bean addict?

Han, if you have
something to say,

look us in the kneecaps
and say it.

(sniffs)

I smell smoke,
and where there's smoke,

there's usually
something of mine burning.

Earl, watch the diner for me.

Sure thing.

Girls, watch the diner for me.

I gotta go to the bathroom
again.

My prostate changes faster
than the lineup of The View.

Caroline,
watch the diner for me.

Max, watch the diner for me.
(both laugh)

Jinx, you owe me a soda.

But not from here.

(laughing)

Hilar, right?

Not you.

Randy was giving me
a Facetime motorboat.

Hey, Caroline.

Arr, it was a bit nippy
in there.

Ahoy, Captain.
(laughs)

Oh, why am I playing along?

Well, we should probably stop
having phone sex

'cause I'm at Pinkberry

and I got
a lot of decisions to make.

Well, call me back
so your pinkberries

don't become blueberries.

(laughs)

Girls, come on.
This is a workplace.

Do you think I can use dish soap
on these?

You should use gasoline
on those.

So...

isn't it about time
you and Randy

made your relationship
official again?

You talk to him
more than you talk to me,

which brings me
to my second point:

Excuse me.

I'm looking for Earl Washington.

How do you know
Earl's last name?

Even his license just says Earl.

You're not the DirecTV lady,
are you?

'Cause he told us
he's not paying for Starz

till the channel
actually gets some.

Earl Washington,
about 6'2",

strong as an ox,
big bushy afro?

Honey, we shrunk the Earl.

Um, when was the last time you
saw this "Big Earl"?

1961.
We were sweethearts.

But I went to Havana
to visit my family

and to bring Earl back
some cigars.

Then the revolution came
and the rest is communism.

Earl's got people hunting him
down across time and space,

and I can't get a second date?

(gasps)
Earl!

Oh, it's you.

I recognize that swagger.

She does?

Wow, Pilar.

You have my cigars?

He remembers her,
but yesterday

he accidentally worked
a full shift at Denny's.

I can't believe I'm here.

You know, I tried to float
to you on a porta-potty in 1984,

but it did not work out.

I haven't been this excited

since I found out
I didn't work at Denny's.

You are still
a fine piece of man, Earl.

And you are beau-ti-ful.

Girl, let's get outta here.

How do you feel
about exclusively being on top?

Mmm, mmm, mmm.

He's still got it.

Where is he hiding it?

That is so cute.

I hope she knows CPR.

Those over-eaters are really
getting their money's worth.

Especially since you added
the meat layer.

It's gonna compliment
the potatoes.

(cell phone chimes)

Speaking of complimenting
my potatoes,

listen to what Randy texted.

No, thanks.
If I liked porn,

I wouldn't have thrown away
Sophie and Oleg's

"We're Having a Baby" card.

No, this is disturbingly clean.

"Have an hour layover
in Newark Airport tomorrow.

So close and yet so far."

-(gasps)
-What does that mean?

Does he wanna see my boobs
or my junk?

Now he's speaking my language.

The language of romantic comedy.

He wants more.

My butt?

Max, he wants you
to meet him at the airport.

Airports are the romantic climax
to every great love story.

Casablanca,

Love Actually,

Snakes on a Plane.

Ah, now I get it.

So point to it on my body.

Hey, girls.

I'm trying
to make the baby laugh.

Here's one...

Two girls walk into
a dessert bar

and they never leave.

(laughs)

Ah, see?
Nothing.

You girls think I'm funny.
Right?

You married Oleg,
so you have a sense of humor.

I don't get it.

I'm trying
to make Barbara laugh,

but you know what?
I'm like Leno at 10:00.

You know?
I'm getting nothing.

See?
Crickets.

Have you tried any
got-your-nose material?

Always makes Caroline laugh.

(laughing)
Stop!

Give me back my nose!

(laughs)

You know what?
That's really not funny.

You know what they say.

That babies that are this age
are supposed to laugh,

and that gets me really worried.

'Cause what if Barbara
has no idea what's funny?

Like a Netflix comedy.

Narcos is pretty funny,

but I guess
you had to be there.

Wait a minute.
I got something.

Ah, she doesn't even like
fart jokes.

Neither do we.

Speak for yourself.

All right.

Did you text Randy back?

I don't know what to say to him.

How does, "New phone, who dis?"
sound?

If you were Sally,
you would have never met Harry.

If he wants me
to meet him at the airport,

he's gonna have
to come out and ask me.

Can you have
a contact heart attack

from looking at something?

'Cause my left arm is tingly.

Let's load this monster
in the back.

What if I get there
and I'm like, "Hey,"

and he's like, "Uh, hey..."

I don't wanna be embarrassed.

Then don't say "hey"
like that ever.

And since when do you care
about being embarrassed?

Your raincoat is a trash bag.

Ugh, it matches
my duct tape shoes.

I am not going to the airport.

Uh, sure, Pilar.

It's on like Donkey Kong.

How's it going with Pilar?

You crazy kids still having fun?

She's wearing me out.

Well,
at least you have somebody.

Whoa, simmer down,
Lonely Island.

Earl, what's going on?

She wants to see
everything she's missed

in the last 50 years.

Now she wants to go
to Disney World.

You know what, Earl?
You need to breathe.

How about we go for one of those
invigorating walks we take

whenever your leg blood
isn't moving?

Do you need your Walker, Earl?

Of course I do.

Thank you.

Just put it right over--

(gasps)

That admittedly gorgeous cake

is not the property
of the Williamsburg Diner.

I'm losing interest
real fast here Han.

Where am I putting this box?

I'm moving the cake.

You play with the bull,
you get the Han.

I guess CrossFit
failed me again today.

You went once
and you passed out.

where you destroyed something
very important to the girls

and they're going to kill you.

Yeah, we're still here.

You dropped the cake.
This is happening.

What have I done?

Looks like someone
got themselves in a little jam.

Mmm, raspberry.

Stop licking things.

We need to put this
back together.

Yes, yes, this is working.

No one will be the wiser.

We'll just frost over the crime.

Why is there a ham?

This cake makes no sense!

Get up.

You're making
a fool of yourself.

And that's coming from a guy

who burnt his nuts
on a hand dryer earlier.

(crying)
Tell me what to do.

Relax.

This cake had no family,

no friends,
no dental records.

I've done this before.

With other cakes, of course.

I'm so scared.

Earl is really in a bad way
over Pilar.

I've never seen him
that confused.

Well, then you've never
watched him button a shirt.

-Where's the cake?
-The cake?

(gasps)
We put it right here.

It couldn't have grown
little legs and walked away.

Little legs?

(both gasp)
together: Han!

Oleg, have you seen our cake?

I see a lot of cakes.

This is New York City.
Cakes up the wazoo.

Pancakes, baby cakes,
patty cakes.

They should change the name
to New Cake City.

He knows something.

Not much, but something.

But that is a pretty great name
for New York.

Earl, have you seen
a man-sized cake

being carried by
a cake-sized man?

I have other stuff on my mind.

I gotta tell Pilar
I don't wanna go to Disney World

and Burning Man's off too.

HAN: Hello, girls.

I've been thinking
of adding a chicken leg

to the shift meal.
Thoughts?

Where'd you hide our cake?

With the rest of your body?

(laughs)

Who crapped in your coffee?

First I'm gonna say:

That's a strong yes
on the chicken leg.

Now, where's my maple vanilla
cake with hot dog filling?

There's something sweet
in there,

but it's not cake.

You've got nothing on me.

Oleg, tell them
I haven't seen their cake.

Right, bro?

Cake? What cake?
I see a lot of cakes.

This is New York City.
Cakes up the wazoo.

patty cakes, pancakes,
baby cake.

-They should name the city, uh--
-New Cake City.

You saw how cramped it is
back there.

This morning I had to go in
one boob at a time.

(scoffs)
Where could it be?

Just 'cause your keys
were in there one time.

Hey, everybody.

We're here.

Yeah, me and the ice queen.

You know,
if she doesn't laugh soon,

people are gonna think
she's German.

She's getting
real monster truck rally

with that carriage.

Well, I guess I'm gonna have
to make another cake.

I have 60 "just checking in"
voicemails on my phone

asking about it.
(cell phone chimes)

Oh, 61.

But you have to go meet Randy
at the airport.

I'm not going to the airport.

Besides, I have too many enemies
at Hudson News.

Sophie, where did you get that?

Oleg.

Can you believe he buried this?

(chuckles)
Good thing that I can dig.

It was Han.
If it makes you feel any better,

he cried as we shoveled it
into a bucket.

BOTH: Han!

MAX: Get out here!

We know you killed our cake.

You sold me out?

I want my 48.50 back,
you stool pigeon.

I can't bury a cake

and not bring some home
for my wife.

You heard my vows.

This is your fault

for not paying attention
to my notes.

Prepare to meet your maker, Han.

Which I'm assuming is Mattel.

Please don't kill me.

I have so much...
a lot...

well, some things to live for.

(baby laughs)

Did you hear that?

Ah, the girls scared Han,

and it made Barbara laugh.

Ah, I guess she likes
to hear other babies in danger.

(baby laughs)

That's my girl.

Hi, Earl.

I am excited to fly to Florida
instead of floating there

on the door of a '57 Chevy.

Earl, is there anything
you wanna tell Pilar

Got the park hopper.

It's two parks
for the price of three.

Earl?

Oh, hell.

Uh, Pilar...

I don't wanna got Disney World.

Look, Pilar,
I've drank it all,

I've smoked it all,
I've done it all.

You are just starting out
on your ride.

I don't wanna slow you down.

I see.

This is why
I'm not going to the airport.

She's probably so embarrassed
right now.

You'd think I'd be embarrassed

because I came all this way here
for you,

but I don't regret it.

Uh, excuse me?

Can I get some mustard
for this cake?

Earl, if I didn't come,

I'd always have wondered
what could have been.

I am glad you came.

Showed me
my heart can take a lot.

-(giggles)
-Whoever had this one before me

must have been a jogger.

It was great seeing you, Earl.

Now, I'm gonna
go get my Goofy on.

back into his wheelchair.

All right, Randy's last flight
landed at terminal four,

and his next flight
is out of terminal six.

He should be here any second.

You look beautiful.

You sure?

Do I have anything in my teeth?

Just the candy corn
you use as a molar.

(gasps)
There he is!

Randy!

Sorry, I'm not sure I'll ever
get to have

my own airport moment.

Caroline,
what're you doing here?

Even in libraries.

Should I take my shirt off too?

No, you're in an airport,
not a McDonald's.

Max, I--

I didn't think you were
actually coming to see me.

Hey.

I'm really happy you came.

You are?

Then why didn't you just ask me?

I guess I was worried
you'd say no,

and I'd be embarrassed.

I was worried
you didn't want me to come

and then I'd be embarrassed.

Classic misunderstanding.

Close enough.

So we're doing this?

Because if not,
I gotta get back to Sheryl.

She still has my shoes.

Uh, yeah, I think we have to.

I mean,
this is all Caroline has.

(gasps)
Oh, it's so beautiful.

Oh, come on, people.

(cash register dings)

(rock music)

*

Miss?

I have to apologize.

Well, not to me, but I'm sure
the Amish are pissed

that you're gaying up
their look.

I don't have enough
money for the tip.

Weird. You survive
the diner chili,

and it's the waitress
that kills you!

But I can tip another way.
I'm a psychic.

So, uh, you already know

where they're gonna
find your body.

Oh, please.
I die in a bridge collapse

you have nothing to do with.

I can tell you your future.

Ha! You're wrong.
I don't have one.

See the guy
in the booth over there?

Jared "Leto Himself Go"?

He just offered to read
my future as my tip!

Ha! You don't
have one.

Miss, let me read
your palm.

Sir, coming over here
right now is not a good idea.

We don't like to be
stiffed by strangers.

In six months, maybe,
but we're not there yet.

I'm a legit psychic.

I predicted long hair
was coming back

in time to have long hair
when it did.

Okay. You can read
my palm.

I could use some good news.

I could also use some
hand moisturizer--sorry.

I see two Ms?

You bitch! Have you
been holding out on M&M's?

Ooh! Is it the male model

I'm managing

who's also
making it with Max?

Actually...I see
a small failure.

I take it back.
You are good!

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

Here's your
chocolate lemon crumble.

Sounds like it shouldn't
work together, but it does.

It's the Tony Bennett
and Lady Gaga of desserts.

Max, can I have
just a wee bite?

A crumble of the crumble?

Caroline won't let me
eat anything

because of my big
photo shoot.

[sighs]
Hurry!

No chewing, no enjoying.
Just swallow.

Spit that out!

No!

I said spit that out!

You're a model now!
Shame on you!

Bitch, he's starving.

He's not eating, is he?

I don't want
the Stay Puft Marshmallow man

showing up
at my girlfriend's photo shoot.

I haven't eaten anything
since Tuesday!

This morning, he tried
to swallow his toothpaste,

but I was right there
to stop him.

Good, honey.

That kind of heartlessness
is why I've decided

to make you the manager
of our hot new location

of the High.

Oh, my God!
This is so exciting!

Someone's finally realizing
my full potential,

and it's not me!

Will I be able to make Max
head pastry chef?

And where is
this new location?

Well, right now,
everything's under wraps

the way my face was
six months ago.

But as manager,
you can hire your own staff,

and I'll even let you
poach Max.

I'll also tell you

the new spot is amazing.

It's international.
It's a hub.

I'm talking
major flagship.

Honey, I get that
you're happy,

but enough with
the eye contact.

No one can look me
in the eye.

I'm the Medusa in Chanel.

Max doesn't let me
look her in the eyes

during sex either.

I told you,
eye contact's extra.

Max, did you hear that?

Major flagship!

Uh, did someone just
call me a major flag?

I think you did,
and if I don't get to

go to the new place
with you two,

I'm telling HR.

That's Hector Rodriguez,
my therapist.

Would you be interested
in coming to the new High

as part of our team?

If you say
"part of our team" again,

I'll rethink
the whole thing.

I'll take it.

But I have to be
upfront with Max.

I don't like it
in the back.

Which, by the way, is what
I say to all my dates.

Samesies!

Well, this is great news.

How about we celebrate
with a piece of pie?

No!

Earl, we have great news.
Guess what it is.

No, don't. Okay, guess.
No, don't. Yes, guess, guess!

Can we hurry this along?

My cousin is on
Maury Povich today,

and I wanna find out
if he's the father.

'Cause then I can stop
paying child support.

Sorry.
She's a little amped.

She hasn't had
good news to share

since we found out
the washing machine

in our basement
takes buttons.

Han! We have good news.

Sure, you do.

And I'm playing center
for the New York Knicks!

Have you seen the Knicks
lately?

He can only help.

Well, according
to my time card,

I've been here
for six hours already,

so I'm gonna head back
and catch some Zs.

The Mattress
is all yours, Max.

Hey, everybody.
We weren't expecting company.

I came by

to discuss wedding details
with Oleg

while we had intercourse.

What is this,
the Bunny Ranch?

Baby, I think these
are yours.

Yeah.

Yeah. Why, thank you,
honey.

Can we just make it
a general rule

that there's no fornication
in the diner?

Or in Han's apartment,
ever.

Okay, Max and I have some
really exciting news.

Yeah, yeah.
We know all about the buttons.

Oleg!

I think you crushed
my seating arrangement!

I'd like to think so.

So, back to us.

How 'bout back to work?

Max and I...

Need to do some work!

There. End of news.

Where are you running
off to so fast?

Is someone having a sale
on smaller heads?

I'm too small,
I'm too big--pick one!

Here's our big news.

You are looking at
the manager

and the head pastry chef
of the brand-new High location.

Actually, he's looking
at our kneecaps.

Okay, so we're going with
too small.

If you two quit the diner,
how will I ever replace you?

Unless I hire...
literally anyone else!

No, Han, we still
have to work here at night.

We have more debt
than Jada Pinkett-Smith

has excuses
for Will not being home.

But at the new High,

we're gonna be
the big bosses

calling all the shots.

Yes, yes...by day.

But by night,
you'll be the coleslaw's bitch.

Don't listen to him.

Clearly, Han just
resents our success.

I know! Why can't women ever
just be happy for each other?

Wow, that is really hot.

Yeah.

The milder salsa's
right here.

Listen--oh!

Do girls eat now?

Wow! Lena Dunham
changed everything!

Listen, which one of you
is sleeping with the model?

I know one of you said
you were,

but I don't listen
when you talk.

[muffled]
She is.

This is a massive ad campaign,

and I don't know
how else to say this,

but I need his penis
to look bigger.

Oh! Yeah...

It gets nervous when
you shine a light on it.

Sometimes I hear her coaxing
it out of its crawl space

with treats.

Well, do something.

I haven't touched one
since college,

and even then it was just
to look under it for my keys.

Max, take him off set.
Be professional.

How professional
can I be?

She's asking me
to fluff his nutter.

Yo, Nash!
Break time.

So...Marie.

Did Joe tell you about
my big new job promotion?

Of course she did.
We're lesbians.

Talking is most of
what we do.

It's why we rule daytime.

(Irish accent)
Eh...pardon me.

You, maybe.
That coat--never.

I'm lookin' for someone.

You also look like an extra
from Angela's Ashes.

But this is a private shoot,

as in we're shooting
someone's privates.

I'm looking for me son.

Okay, people!
The groundhog's outta the hole!

Six more inches of winter.

That's him!
That's me boy!

Ma?

Huh?

Ma, how did you know
I was in New York?

Aw, no, you saw me in
the Today Show window,

didn't ya?

You checked into "America"
on Facebook,

you bleedin' idiot.

I flew all the way and been
lookin' for you day and night

in this dirty, God forsaken
city for a week.

I'm takin' you home.

Ma'am, Nash can make
his own decisions.

He's a grown man.

Yep. Thanks to my handiwork.

He's no grown man.
He's just now 18.

He's got his prom
next month!

I can't believe it!

I had sex with a teenager!

Who am I, Woody Allen?

Roman Polanski?

Pretty much any of your
big-time '70s movie directors?

You had sex
with me innocent child?

Uh, not so innocent.

He made me blush
a few times,

and I have two positions
named after me.

Well, that's that.

You've seen the last of
big booby dirty girl here.

I'd object, but when you're
right, you're right.

But Ma,
I like New York.

People want to take
pictures of me willy here.

This is all me fault.

I should have never let you
watch that Magic Mike.

That's great.

I don't have a model now.

I'm Seal.

Wait until
I tell Joe about this.

How can you not know
how old he is?

Uh...what can I say?
We're a typical couple!

He lied about his age, and I
pretended he was interesting.

Okay, Max, when Joe gets here,

I'm just gonna tell her

that me managing
an underage twink

has nothing to do
with me managing her restaurant

which sells overpriced
twink...ies.

Yeah. I'm sure she'll
be professional about it all.

Professional?

Yesterday, she slapped
a woman in here

for wearing cheap heels.

I know.
My face is still red.

Here she is.

Good morning, Joe!

Hey, ladies.

Well, obviously,
you're both fired.

Obviously.

Can I keep the hat?

You are not gonna
want this back.

My head sweats like
a watermelon at a picnic.

Please don't fire us
over the Nash situation.

It was out of our hands.

Actually,
it was in her hands,

and it was only 18.

You two embarrassed
my girlfriend.

And embarrassment
in the lesbian community

is worse than
not owning a dog.

It's worse than dating
Anne Heche.

Oh, my God.
We committed a Heche crime.

How can we make it better?

Just get that kid back
to the photo shoot tomorrow,

and we're back in business.

And Max, next time,

stay out of his
barely legal business.

Done. Don't know how,
but done.

You won't be sorry.

Just get him back,
'cause I gotta tell ya...

Marie's crying face?

Not for me.

Well, coleslaw...

just when I thought
I was out,

you pulled me back in
again.

Max, don't tell
the coleslaw that.

Don't give it that power.

My plan to get Nash back
will work.

We still have a bright,
bright future.

Yes! By day.

Han!

Do you want to spend
another night

in this coleslaw bucket?

No. And had I not
been able to

roll myself
out to the street,

I might have
suffocated!

Nash and his mom
will be here any minute, Max.

Do you really need to expose
60% of your boobs?

It's not up to me.

These girls have a life
of their own.

The right one just started
a Fleetwood Mac cover band.

You know how I know?

'Cause when I take my bra off,
it goes its own way.

Do you really think
you can get Nash's mother

to change her mind
when they come in

to pick up the rest of
his stuff?

Yes, I do.

Because she and I
have a lot in common.

I may not be Irish,
but I'm dirt poor,

and I'm living with someone
who drinks way too much.

(Oleg)
Max, look.

All those purple post-its

are Sophie's friends and family.

My family's
nowhere to be seen!

It's like I'm looking at
the last U.S. census!

Hey, girls.
Come over here.

We need your help
with the seating chart.

Yeah. You know, planning
a wedding is more work

than waxing Oleg's back
during a full moon.

Sophie, I have my own
issue right now.

Okay. Then Max
can help me with the chart

while you go worry about
your obviously thinning hair.

Uh, full disclosure--

the last time someone asked me
to help them with something,

I free-based
half their beard off.

[chime]

I just got a text
from Nash.

He's here? I'll go get him
a kid's menu.

They're not coming.

His mom found the racy
pictures I sent him.

"Flying out of JFK
tomorrow.

Taking the morning
Aer Lingus"?

A little morning
"Aer Lingus"?

Isn't that what got Max
in trouble in the first place?

Okay, well, we just
have to go to the airport

and stop them.

I'll buy us plane tickets
and then return them,

like I do with shoes or
Tom Cruise does with wives.

Jackets and shoes off!

And make sure you check
all your pockets.

Don't make me shut this airport
down for a piece of gum.

This line is longer
than the movie Gone Girl.

What does TSA stand for?
"Time Stands A-still?"

That's cute.
Never heard that one before.

Most people just go with
"This Sucks Ass."

Max, please don't
yell out again.

People get very jumpy
in airports.

Oh, what? It's not like
I screamed, "I have a bomb!"

Miss, will you step
over here, please?

Oh, I was kidding.
I don't have a bomb.

But I have been known
to...be da bomb.

Max!

Please, please,
if we step away,

we'll lose our place
in line.

I know it sounds like
we're here to blow up a plane,

but we're really just here
to stop an underage kid

she had sex with
from leaving the country.

So I should just come
over there now.

Yep.
You just been hand-picked

to join the "I don't trust you"
dance party.

May I see your tickets?

Nice day.
I like your hair.

Thanks. We're allowed
to be creative

from the neck up.

Ooh! You traveling
to Paris.

First-class.

In those jeans?

You got first-class
tickets to Paris?

Are you insane?

My fingers did it.

It was rich girl
cellular memory.

And if we're not
going anywhere,

why can't we
not go to Paris?

And why can't we not
go to the Louvre?

And why can't we not
stay in the penthouse

at the George Cinq
and not order room service?

Is it too late for me
to say I don't know her?

Ma'am, are you carrying
any explosives?

I had leftover Chipotle
for breakfast.

Does that count?

It does to whoever's
sitting next to you.

(woman, French accent)
Air France flight 113

will now begin boarding
at gate 24.

Max! That's our flight.

(bad French accent)
Air France, flight 113.

Ooh! I bet on the plane,

they'll have caviar
and Bellinis.

You know what won't
be on the plane?

Us!

We're not going!

Have you been smoking
the half joint

I have hidden
in my bra?

You have a joint?

Bank account? Ha!

You went through security
with pot?

I went through
third grade with pot.

There he is.
There's Nash.

I'm sure his mom
is asking

if he can visit the cockpit
and meet the pilot.

Wow. He's young.

So young, Bruce Jenner
has been a woman

for most of his life.

Nash!
Please.

You can't go.
Our entire lives depend on

you finishing
that photo shoot.

Nash Terrence O'Brien,
you're not going anywhere.

Or I'll take you
over my knee right here.

Well, he likes that.

Well, you...

You are just loose
as a goose, aren't ya?

Again...when you're
right, you're right.

Max, let me talk
to Mrs. O'Brien.

Go up to the gate.

Ask what movie they're
showing on their flight.

Okay, but if they're showing
anything,

and I mean anything

from Mr. Adam Sandler...

I'm getting on the plane too.

Please.
I'm begging you.

You don't know me.
I'm a proud woman.

The only other time
I ever begged

was to get off
of P. Diddy's yacht.

I mean, a party
shouldn't be three days long.

Miss, you can save
your silly breath.

I'm taking him home.

Would passenger Maeve O'Brien
please report to the gate desk?

Oh, Nash, maybe
they're bumping us up

from the last coach row to the
second to the last coach row!

I knew I'd be rewarded
for not having any abortions

in spite of me circumstances.

Grab Nash--let's get
out of here

while I got her
distracted.

Max, you did that?
How?

I no longer have
the half a joint in my bra.

You bribed an airline
employee with a joint?

Pain? Oh, you really gotta
stretch out for that.

Max, this is kidnapping.

Oh, he's not that young.
When I was his age,

I had already robbed
three Blockbuster videos.

What's Blockbuster video?

Oh, my God,
I screwed a baby.

Okay. I'm gonna text Joe
and tell her we have Nash

in our custody.
No, I'd better call.

That text won't play well
at our trial.

I'm sorry I didn't tell ya
I was so young.

But honestly, I didn't
think it mattered

since you're so immature.

I know you are,
but what am I?

Okay, so Joe was
really impressed

with the kidnapping,
and she gave us our jobs back.

But Nash,
you've been replaced.

They found another model

who wouldn't give them
any parent trouble--

a well-hung orphan.

A well-hung orphan.

Well, the Lord gives
and the Lord takes.

So what now?

Well, you go back to Ireland
and brag to your friends

about having sex with someone
who once had sex

with Axl Rose's
best friend's son.

Good-bye, Max.

Later, Nash Potater.

You know, I think
I'm gonna miss him.

Especially since kids
eat free at Quiznos before 6:00.

Ugh! Let's get out
of here.

The only good thing
about airports

is leaving them
for someplace better.

Max, next time we're here,
I'm gonna take you to Paris.

Well, first take me
to the bathroom.

I've had to pee since
our tram hit that pothole.

Well, at least we're gonna
be working somewhere with class.

I wonder where it is.

Joe said it's a real hub,
flagship, international.

Yeah. It's gonna be
international terminal 8!

What?

Here?

We're working here?

I've got to find out
who I brutally murdered

in a previous life
and make it up to him or her.

This sucks!
The one place

no one will ever
give us a ride to work!

(female announcer)
Final boarding for Air France,
flight 113.

Of course it is.

Look at the bright side.
These days, most planes

don't even make it to where
they're supposed to go.

(announcer)
Paging first-class passengers
Caroline Channing

and Max Black.

Those rich bitches
are so lucky!

Max, look out,
you're so tired

you're spilling batter
all over yourself.

Ugh.

I knew it was only
a matter of time

before I became
a battered woman.

This is
a huge disappointment.

I heard that.

You don't even know
what I'm referring to.

Oh, I just assumed we were
talking about everything.

I'm referring
to our expensive

new cupcake website.

Not one job offer.

You want a website that will make you
feel better about yourself?

Go to
models-falling-down.com

Klum goes boom.

It's 3:00 A.M.
Who would be coming over now?

I don't know,
my dealer, my other dealer?

That guy who always asks
if I know where my dealer is?

- Who is it?
- You can't handle

what's on the other
side of that door.

Yesterday,
I saw a guy on a stoop

frenching his cat.

I can handle anything.

Oleg, what are you
doing here?

And you put the, "oh, no,"
in kimono.

Your upstairs neighbor
Sophie

is allowing me
to have sex with her.

And I came down to borrow
some sensual oils.

Preferably,
ones that you can eat.

How did you
get out of apartment?

You know the rules.

I came down
to borrow sensual oils.

Yeah, but no peppermint.

It makes his tongue swell.

And let's face it,

his tongue is the best part
about him.

You're right,
I can't handle that.

those nice smelling men
in booth two

just asked me
if I was on the down-low.

What does this mean?

They said,
"are you on the down-low,

because we have a friend
who is a big-time rice queen."

Again, coming up dry.

Rice queen, is it, like,
a Korean dairy queen?

Kind of.

Here's table seven's check,
Earl.

Max,
the guys at booth two

just asked Han
if was on the down-low.

They think he's gay.

That's a step up.

Usually people think
he's a lesbian.

Here you go, Sophie.

Uh, Max, Caroline.

Yeah, about last night,

I hope we can keep that
just between us girls.

I'm sure we have all
done things in the dark

late at night with men
that we'd like to forget.

Why stop at late at night
in the dark?

How about early morning?

Or a nooner at
the port authority bus terminal?

Oh, good.

And you too understand,
Caroline?

Actually, no, sorry.

I haven't ever done
anything with a man

- that I'm ashamed of.
- Oh, yeah.

But your father did
steal millions

and millions of dollars.

So... don't forget that.

Han just sat
your favorite gays.

Max, their names
are Steven and Michael.

And it's not very P.C. To reduce
people to a stereotype.

- Hey, girl.
- What's up, care bear?

Yeah, they're not
stereotypes.

What would you say
if they called you

"the big-boob waitress from
the wrong side of the tracks

who had sex
with everyone in high school"?

I'd say,
"that's why I love the gays.

They get me."

Come over and say hello.

They're the first
and practically the only

people that ever hired us
to do a cupcake job.

Do I have to?

Can't I just stand here
and judge from afar?

Come on, and let's not
mention how bad we're doing.

We want them to think
we're a big success,

so they'll recommend us
for their friends' events.

Yeah, because you know the gays,
they party about everything.

And there's
another stereotype.

- Hi, guys.
- Happy leap year!

F.Y.I., people
are still talking about

those cupcakes you made
for our wedding shower.

- Everyone.
- How's business?

Fabulous, amazing,
killing it.

Or it's killing us.
We're not quite sure.

I'll go grab some menus
for you girls.

- Max.
- Sorry.

I'll go grab some menus
for you ladies.

Love her... so Madeleine Stowe
in revenge.

Oh, she is.

- I don't watch that.
- We love it.

It's all about
a young blonde woman

who's out to seek revenge
on everyone

for destroying her family.

Yeah, too close to home.

- Max, guess what.
- Caroline, you're not

supposed to tell me
I'm on intervention

until the actual
intervention.

I just got offered $600

to stay at Steven
and Michael's apartment

and watch their dogs
while they're out of town

- for two days.
- Why would anyone pay $600

to watch dogs
for two days?

Well, because, you know,
they want a certain

amount of attention
to be paid to the...

Just say it, they're gay and they think
their dogs are their children.

Max, you have to stop
doing this.

I'll stop
when they stop.

This is so exciting.

It'll be like a paid vacation
at an amazing hotel.

And I need to get as far away
from here as possible.

- Oh, where do they live?
- Four blocks away.

Well, have a good time.

And while you're
four blocks away

having your vacation,
I'll be home

maybe taking a little
masturbacation.

What are you
talking about?

I wouldn't go on vacation
without you.

We'll split the dog money
to cover the shifts

we take off
from the diner.

Well, thanks,
but I don't do that thing

where you take off work.

"Hi, I'm Max, I can't go

"to a fancy apartment
and have fun.

"I'd rather work
in a steel mill

and sing
Bruce Springsteen songs."

Max, when was the last time
you had a vacation?

Never.

Unless you count
the summer I hid

under the front porch
from my mom's new boyfriend.

We really need
to get out of here.

This is more than just
spring break.

It's a break
from the diner,

from the cupcake business,
from being poor,

from everything
depressing right now.

Things aren't
that depressing.

Oh.

Yeah, well,
I'm sure we have

all done things with men
in kitchens that...

We are not proud of.

Spring break
is the greatest time ever.

You just go crazy
and do shots

and throw all the rules
out the window.

Oh, I've done that.

But when you're poor,
you just call it Tuesday.

Why are you
walking like that?

This is my
spring break walk.

These shoulders
have shimmied like this

all the way
from Majorca to Ibiza.

Try it, Max.
Shake a little.

- Shake.
- That's cool.

I'll just wait till
I get the DTS later.

Maybe I don't
have the right key.

Oh, hi.

Sorry, I think we might
be at the wrong door.

That's a bummer
for the door.

It's over there, 12d.

We're house-sitting
for a few days.

Cool, I'm Brendon.

Hey, Brendon.
I'm Ashley.

- And...
- I'm surprised.

- And also Max.
- I'd shake your hands,

but I kind of stink.

I've been at my microbrewery
most of the day,

so I am sorry
if I smell like yeast.

Hey, that's my apology.

Whoa, all right, cool.

Well, I will see
you guys around, yeah?

Yeah, totes.

You have something
you want to tell me, Ashley?

I never use Caroline channing
on vacation

for security reasons.

I was almost abducted
at gunpoint

for a ransom
in Mexico city.

Wow, gunpoint.

Were you using the word,
"totes" at the time?

Can you take out the paper
that has the alarm code on it?

Wow, this place
is amazing.

It's, like, the cover
of gay gay gay magazine.

Max, you have to stop
reducing them

to that gay stereotype.

Now, read me
the security code.

It's..."Liza."

A lot of different
types of people

like Liza Minnelli.

Oh, look,
it's a poodle in a tutu.

That's not gay, right?

Lots of...
Lots of different

types of people
have a poodle in a tutu...

Named Barbra Streisand.

Oh, there's the book
of instructions.

"Hey, girl.
Hey, care bear.

"Have fun with Barbra Streisand
and Wynonna Judd.

"Wynonna is a little
temperamental

"and tends to stay
in the bedroom.

"We didn't have time to purge
her anal gland before left.

Instructions on page two."

I'm starting
to understand the $600.

"Don't worry, it's easy.
We do it all the time."

No wonder Wynonna's
so temperamental.

"Help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

There are portable saunas
in the closet."

Portable saunas?

Love it, what is it?

This is so cool.

I'm hot
like I'm at the beach,

but I'm not stepping
in any used condoms.

Yeah, these are great.

My friend
Candice travelstead

used one to make weight
for prom.

Are you done with that?

Yeah, switch?

On spring break,
I always loved

spending the day
at the beach.

Just the chilling
and the girl talk.

Yeah.
Tell me again,

about the sound the anal gland
made when you squeezed it.

Please, stop.

I already told you twice.

And now, wynonna Judd
won't even look at me.

Well, not without
her lawyer in the room.

I'm hungry.
What do you eat on vacation?

Anything we want.

Let's see.

I bet their refrigerator is
stocked with all kinds of pates

and cheeses
and those parm crisp things.

By the way, nice suit.

You look like someone should
be pouring a 40 on you

in a rap video.

Thanks.

There's nothing.

I mean, come on,
what kind of gays are they?

All anal gland
and no cheese.

I just expected
everything to be better.

You know,
champagne on ice,

thousand
thread-count sheets.

I mean, the towels...
They're not even bath sheets.

Wait, the towels
aren't good?

Because I already stole two.

They're fine,
they're just not

what I was expecting.

What's happening
over there?

You could use
a little shoulders.

You're right,
enough, we're on vacay.

Come on, let's go get dressed
and find someplace to eat.

Are you crazy?
I am not leaving this thing.

This is the happiest
I've ever been in my life.

Okay, we'll order in,
pretend it's room service.

They must have a menu drawer
here somewhere.

Plus, we'll never
find a restaurant

with a portable sauna
section.

"Food network party tonight

"to celebrate
the release of a cookbook.

Food and drink provided."

Free foodie food,
free foodie drinks?

- Yay, let's go.
- No, I like it in here.

It's amazing.

Ashley wants to go.

Ashley wants to go.

Fine,
but can I bring the dog?

I've always wanted
to be one of those girls

who brings a tiny dog
to a public place

and just
looks at everyone, like,

"yeah, I have a tiny dog,
so what?"

You can be whoever
you want to be.

You're on vacation.

I'm gonna go invite
Brendon to come.

You gotta have a crush
on spring break.

Well,
I'm sitting in my crush.

Hey, shouldn't you
put something on?

Uh, it's spring break.

Aah!

Barbra, get help.

Go, Barbra Streisand, go.

Hey,
look at the book title,

Bacon.

Heaven bacon.
That's good wordplay.

It's okay.
Not much of a crowd.

Party's a little
disappointing.

Bacon truffle,
Barbra Streisand?

Mm?

Yeah, I'm feeding my tiny dog
a truffle, so what?

Miss, miss.

Excuse me,
what are these things for?

Oh, it holds your drink
while you get food.

- No!
- Yeah.

Yeah, these are great when
you see them for the first time.

For me,
it was on a yacht

in the Mediterranean.

You know what else
these are good for?

Frees up your shoulders
to shimmy.

You shimmy.
I'm gonna walk over here

and find us a bigger, shinier
something to do later.

Later?
We're going home

- to our amazing apartment.
- Or not.

Come on, Max,
it's spring break.

Let's not get tied down.

I'll be over there.

Yeah, we'll be over there.

Oh.

Hi. You're not allowed
to have dog in here.

Unless he wants
to buy the book.

What are you,
some kind of foodie bouncer?

Worse.
I wrote the book.

Yeah, nice sleeves.

You get those in
the tattoo gold rush of '09?

I'm Zeke.
What's your name?

I'm Max.
This is my tiny dog.

I take her everywhere,
so what?

Hey, Max, you wanna try
my thick-cut bacon?

Maybe. Let's just
take things slow.

I'm telling you,
it serves

the best
vegan stew anywhere.

You really should put it
in your blog.

Oh, if I write one more
article about something vegan,

all of my devoted
10,000 readers will hold hands

and jump collectively
out a window.

And I know you like to find
what's new and what's next.

Chocolate bacon?

I just need
a minute over there.

Hi, couldn't help
but overhear.

If you're looking
for what's new,

I found these
two adorable girls

who run a cupcake business

out of their home
in Williamsburg.

I know how that sounds,
but trust me,

totally fresh
and not at all overexposed.

And you're someone
I should listen to because...?

Sorry,
didn't introduce myself.

Ashley Emerson,
style editor for Elle.

Oh.

If you're interested,
I think I might have

a card in here somewhere.

Was holding on to it
for Martha.

Mr. Bacon action figure.

A world of bacon sampler.

And I want to apologize for
the food network trucker hat,

which has nothing
to do with bacon

and everything to do
with me being a sellout.

Guess what.

Ashley just gave our card

to a woman who's such a bitch
she must be important.

She's a food blogger.

It's a long shot,

but we need to get
some exposure.

Whoa, we are on vacation.

No business talk.
That was the deal, right?

This is Zeke, chef-slash-
author-slash-corporate sellout.

We were, uh...

We were thinking about
going back to the apartment

- to hang out.
- Oh, sounds fun.

Can I see you alone
for a second?

Well, not alone.

I bring my tiny dog
everywhere, so what?

Come on, I heard
of an after-party in Soho

and an after-after-party
in dumbo.

So, let's go-ho.

Have fun and get
this vacation started.

I'm holding a tiny dog
at a bacon-book party

and laughing with a guy
who wrote a book about bacon.

I think my vacation's
already started.

All right,
well, have fun.

I'm gonna go par-tay.

Eh, did your thing, Ash.

I don't want
to say that I'm hot.

But the bacon
in my pocket is done.

We said turns were
five minutes, you bastards.

Oh, hi.
More sauna fun.

Max, can I see you
in the hall for a second?

But it's my turn
to sweat my balls off.

Don't think the clock's
not running while I'm out there.

We're going
on a real vacation.

How quickly
can you pack a bag?

And don't worry about
appropriate evening wear.

Every four seasons
has a Gucci

near the Bulgari store
in the lobby.

None of those words
made any sense.

I think you've had
a spring break stroke.

No, seriously, there's a car
waiting downstairs

to take us
to a private plane.

We can be at Teterboro
in 20 minutes

and Tahiti in 8 hours.

The Greek
is paying for everything.

What did they give you?

What's the last thing
you can remember?

Nothing.

I just had some cristal.

Some cristal meth?

No, I'm just
really excited.

I went to the after-party
and this shipping magnate.

Don't worry,
it's not gonna be sexual.

More like a father thing.

Anyway, let's go... finally
got us a good vacation.

But we're having
a good vacation.

Max, don't take this
personally,

but you don't know what
a good vacation is

because you've
never been anywhere.

I mean, you walked
into that apartment

and your face lit up, like...
Like it was amazing.

And that's because
you don't know that it's not.

Trust me.
I've been everywhere.

And I'm telling you,
this is the worst vacation ever.

So let's ditch the bacon freak
and the beer bro,

get on that plane, spend
one great day at the beach,

and then come back
and make $8 an hour.

That sounds fun.

You kind of skipped over
the part where we get abducted

and Nancy grace
covers the year-long search

for our bodies.

It must be Constantine.
He's gonna be upset.

You never
keep a Greek waiting.

Oh, my God, Max,
we just got an email

on our website from that
food blogger at the book party.

She said if we drop off four
cupcakes by tomorrow morning,

she'll consider writing about
them for her column that day.

Well, what's it gonna be,
Caroline or Ashley?

Cupcakes or Tahiti?
Your call.

Is the Greek
still waiting?

He just pulled away.

I'm sure he'll come back here
for Ashley sometime.

And when that happens,
I wouldn't want to be her.

Well, after tomorrow,
you won't be.

What can I do?

You mean after
your two personalities

meet and kill each other?

Max, I told you
I needed a break.

I just didn't know it was
gonna be a psychotic one.

You really need
to chill.

You can't
keep freaking out

because you're not where
you want to be...

On vacation
or in our business.

I mean, it's life.
Lower your expectations.

This microbrew
is actually really good.

Tastes better
in the batter.

Hey, crumble up some of that
maple bacon for me.

Sorry about
that stuff I said

about you never having
gone anywhere.

Why?
I never have gone anywhere

or done anything.

And now I'm thinking
that's kind of a good thing,

because I can still
get excited and make a face

when something's new to me.

'Cause, basically,
everything is.

That must be nice.

All right, here,
taste it.

My beer-batter, maple bacon,
spring break cupcake.

Oh, my God, you made
the "something new" face.

I did, because
you made something new.

- It's delicious.
- Do the face again.

Oh, there they are,
the world travelers.

Shouldn't people be throwing
confetti or something?

I'm all out.

I snorted mine
in the power outage of '65.

How was your vacation?

Well, it turned out
to be more of a daycation,

but we had a great time,
didn't we, Max?

Yes, we did.

Max, things sure are dull
around here without you.

Everyone walking around
all P.C.,

nobody called me black.
Hell.

I haven't left once
since you've been gone.

When it comes to this job,
you are my vacation.

Aw.

And that, Earl,
is why I got

all five
of these gift bags for you.

Welcome, again,
to the Williamsburg diner.

This way, please.

I have looked up "down-low"
and "rice queen" on Wikipedia.

And, no, I'm not
a secret homosexual

or a man who chases
only Asian men.

I'm great, I'm straight.
Get used to it.

Hi, guys.
How was your vacation?

Great. Did you have fun
at our place?

Totes.
Your saunas are sick.

I know.
Could they be any gayer?

No.

Just one thing.
Wynonna's still a little upset

about the anal gland event.

What?

I told you she wouldn't
know it was a joke.

How could she not know
it was a joke?

I mean, who would ask someone
to squeeze their dog's pooper?

We're paying you
another 50.

Dude, she went
second knuckle deep

in your beagle's back door
for only another 50?

150.

Thank you.

And just one other thing.

Our business is actually
not that great right now,

so if you could recommend us
to any of your friends,

- that would really help.
- Good for you.

I'm sure business will
pick up after that blog blurb.

- Wait, blog blurb?
- About your beer-battered

maple bacon
spring break cupcake.

We just read about it.

Yeah, in that
foodie bitch's blog.

Max, it worked.

Let's go look at the blog
on Han's computer.

Excuse us.
We'll be right back.

We got a little break
and a big break.

Yeah,
I did it again.

Yeah.

Welcome back.

You missed the best
two days of my life.

Welcome to the diner ATM
ribbon cutting ceremony.

Everyone knows he's holding
normal size scissors, right?

Han's just excited there's something
in the diner same size as him.

Uh, this is just another waste of
time. Like when you opened the diner.

This machine is now open for business!

After you're done with those,

I need to do a little
manscaping on my love mound.

And after you're done with
that, you can throw them away.

Hey, everybody!

What's that yellow tape?

Did someone die again?

No, Sophie, we got an ATM.

I thought we already had an
ATM. "Asian transgender male."

Well, thank you for saying "male."

Well, move outta the way!

This broad's gotta do some bankin'!

Be careful, you're the very first.

We know how long you've been
waiting to say that to a woman.

Okay.

No sign of Deke, the
cops, or nosy white folk.

Let's break in.

I don't understand

Why we're breaking into
your boyfriend's dumpster.

The only thing I understand
less is how you pee standing up.

Why? How do you pee?

I am breaking up with
Deke, so now's the part

of the relationship
where I sneak in his place

and get my stuff out

to avoid telling him
I'm breaking up with him.

Well, you just cut an hour
out of every romantic comedy.

You're welcome.

This is the first guy I
dated that has a crank.

Most of them just did crank.

Okay, so here's the plan.

I'm gonna climb up on the garbage,

Unsnap the windows,
dive in the dumpster,

and grab his spare key on the counter.

Do you look at life as just a game

of "set new lows for Caroline"?

Why do I have to do it?

I'm on parole, Caroline.

We're breaking into a dumpster.

I don't even think that's illegal.

I didn't either.
That's why I'm on parole.

Light on the right, key on the left.

We did this once after Deke left
his keys at our favorite bar,

which is actually just a liquor
store where they let you drink.

They turn a blind eye.

Well, the guy is blind.

Yeah, Deke always found cool places.

Then why are you breaking up with him?

He's perfect for you.

You both think living in a tuna
can is an acceptable habitat.

So what if he has money?

People with money don't
live in the same reality.

You think Donald Trump would
have that hair if he were poor?

Now, come on, let's get
my toothbrush and scram.

You bought a toothbrush?
Oh, you really liked him.

Wait, Max, is that one of your gnomes?

Oh, my God, you were
practically moving in!

And it's your favorite one,

Gnome-o-sexual!

No, this is my second-favorite.

My favorite is "gnome more drama."

And he's not here because
he don't want no more drama,

And frankly, neither do I.

Come on, let's go.

You don't have to ask me
twice to get out of a dumpster.

Well, well.

If it isn't Max-a-million.

Or should I say, "Max
who hates my millions"?

Shouldn't you be occupying
Wall Street or something?

I am just here for my toothbrush,

And then I'll leave you
in your ivory dumpster

to sit around and fart diamonds.

So don't get the wrong
idea, Uncle Pennybags.

I'm not here to be Aunt Pennybags.

Max, who's Uncle Pennybags?

Is he one of the ones who touched you?

He's the Monopoly Man.

See? You guys are
perfect for each other.

Yeah, Max.

We're like a more awesome
version of John and Yoko.

Meaning, like, just John.

Who cares if I got a
few million dollars?

A hundred few million.

And that's on the low
end, according to bing.

Well, I'll be by later, Deke.

Come on, Caroline.

No, Max, you won't.

You're taking your stuff 'cause
you're breaking up with me

And you're too big a baby pants

to tell me you're breaking up with me.

Pfffttt! What?

I am not breaking up with you.

I just needed my toothbrush

because I had dollar shrimp for lunch

and I still have some
shells in my teeth.

I will see you later tonight
for sex and various whatnots.

I am not breaking up with you.

That breakup was brutal!

Yo, Max, I hear our boy
Deke got major money.

I shoulda known, 'cause the
weed he gave me was real quality.

And free.

Earl, money changes people. I know.

Every time the food stamps came,
my mother was all, "Max who?"

'Ello, my good people!

You are quite fortunate today,

For a rich person has come
to dine in your establishment!

Caroline, I would like

a tabletop in Max's section, please.

because it's high time she met

the person I've been
pretending not to be.

The veil has been lifted.
She was correct.

I am the Monopoly Man.

Right this way, sir.

I believe I have a table here
in the overacting section.

All right, I'll give it up.
You got me laughing.

And I would miss all this
if we didn't hang out,

So I guess we can still be friends

and pastry school partners.

Pastry school partners?

Your breasts are named in my will.

Come on, you can't
be serious about this.

Don't worry, we can
still do all the stuff

we had planned for our future.

Like TPing Han's apartment on the 14th.
I'm not a monster.

- Max...
- Deke, you can't be my boyfriend.

From now on I'm like welfare.

You have to be broke to get some.

Max, I really wish you'd reconsider
breaking up with Deke.

I mean, you guys get along great.

He lives in a trash can,

he shares your love of pee-pee jokes.

He can hide things in his hair.

Aren't those the things
you didn't like about him

before you knew he had money?

Yes, but people can change.

So change and like him.

Come on, just keep an open mind.

In fact, why don't you sleep on it?

Right now. Go. Go to bed.
Go, go, go, go, go.

Boy, are you eager to masturbate.

Hey, friend.

Come on, get in.

- I told you I can't see that anymore.
- Why?

You're my friend, he's my friend.

We're all just friends.

Where did you get a key?

Don't be mad. I asked her for help.

Caroline, get in here!

Can't. I'm masturbating!

Caroline, what are you doing?

Are those new shoes?

Uh, yes.

Where did they come from?

They were just here.

In your size?

It's a miracle.

They're from me.

I got 'em for her as a gift.

What makes you think you
could buy my roommate?

She said, "I'll give you the
key if you buy me new shoes."

Ha! For love!

I did it for love!

You two belong together.

Like me and these shoes.

Come on, just give
me a chance to express

my deep feelings about this.

Max, what I'm trying to say is...

Pfffftttt!

I don't wanna be your friend.
I wanna be your boyfriend.

Well, right now it looks like
you want to be my girlfriend.

Maybe I can help clear things up.

How much is this gonna cost me?

Nothing. Look...

Max doesn't think she deserves
someone rich because she has...

Well, low self-esteem.

Wrong. I have no self-esteem.

And I can see the bottom of your balls.

Max, remember two days ago

when you loved the bottom of my balls?

That's when they were poor
and I felt sorry for them.

Come on, you two belong together.

You're like
the Romeo and Juliet of ball banter.

I'm sorry, it's just never gonna work.

It's like we were raised with
different religions, like...

What are two religions?

Are you taking suggestions
from the audience,

or do you really not know
the names of two religions?

Let's say... A witch and a Smurf.

Question answered.

So it's like I'm a
witch and you're a Smurf.

We could never be together.
Everybody knows that.

I've only lived like a witch.
I've never lived like a Smurf.

So I don't get you.

What's it like being blue and soft?

I don't know, I'm a witch.
I'm green and all-powerful.

So you're saying you can't relate to me

because you've never been a Smurf?

Wow. That's heavy.

Well, I'm gonna go.

Oh, I better take off this
silly robe and put on my skirt.

And she's giving back the shoes.

Oh, no, she is not!

"Language preference: English,
Spanish, Chinese, French."

They should've made
this more specific to the diner.

"Hipster, hobo, junkie, pregnant teen."

Don't forget
"ballerina with a head wound."

"Would you like to see
your account balance?"

That ATM's a real bitch.

Yeah, I got a hot 17 in
here that's dying to get out.

So did Oleg when that
cop pulled him over.

Caroline, look at this receipt.

This can't be right.

I haven't seen this
many zeros in one place

Since the diner Christmas party.

That says $1,000,017.

Han, your ATM's broken.

It just gave Max $1 million.

Out of my way! Out of
my way! Out of my way!

This is it! The faulty ATM
that gives out millions.

I thought it was an
urban legend like HPV.

Everybody freeze.

The damn thing must be busted.

And to think I bent over
backwards to get that ATM.

Well, I bent over forwards
to get a "B" in Spanish.

Damn it.
My account's exactly the same.

Frozen.

So, Deke left this note for you earlier.

I forgot 'cause I'm 120.

Now you know what it's
like to be a Smurf.

Can you believe this?
Deke gave me $1 million!

So that's real money?

The money's real?

You have $1 million?

We're a millionaire?

Oh, good morning, my good man.

I recently came into some
money, thus the candy tiara.

And I wanted to spread the wealth.

Here.

Have a pound of coffee.

It's folgers, since
I'm a millionaire now.

Best part of waking up rich!

I come bearing gifts
for all my best friends.

Here, guy who stands behind me...

A 12-pack of triple-A batteries for you.

And yes, they did have to
open the glass case at CVS

for me to get these.

Here, lady on the other side.

A shampoo and conditioner!

Herbal essences, no big deal.

And don't think I forgot
about you, peek-a-boo hair.

A Godiva box of chocolates.

No, you're not dreaming.
I said "Godiva"!

Max, I have great news.

And you, woman who
sold me out for shoes.

I got you something very special
when I was out gift shopping.

You know how you always say,

"Who do I have to bang to
get a chip clip around here?"

Me!

Wait, you spent money?

How much of our million
did you spend on your...

We'll call it a shopping spree.

Almost all of it.

$143!

Okay, our public
schools have failed you.

Or they would have if you'd went.

But I'm too excited to care.

First things first.
When do we quit the diner?

What are you talking about?
We're not quitting the diner.

I'm giving the rest of the money back.

Hold on, hold on, pump the brakes.

What's the problem?
You got a chip clip. You're set.

I only spent it to make a point to Deke.

You can't give it back.
I have plans. Big plans.

After we quit the diner,

I found a guy who can turn
that measly million into 3.

And don't worry, he was not named

in my father's Ponzi scheme.

Well, not by the name he goes by now.

What up, Smurfette?

Oh, hello, Deke.

You just missed me passing out

all the gifts I bought
with your million,

But you're here in time to see me

buy Big Mary as my lab partner.

Who says I'm for sale?

A fireman's calendar...

And another fireman's calendar.

Sold.

I bet you didn't think
I'd spend that money, hmm?

Well, you were wrong.

I spent $143!

Max, I wanted you to spend the money

so you know what it's like to be rich.

Now we're both Smurfs.

You can relate to me again.

Wanna go do hand stuff by the
ovens like we did last Tuesday?

Oh, so you were just trying
to buy me with the money?

Well, I'm not a high-priced call girl.

'cause Super Bowl weekend's over.

Here. I'm giving you the
rest of the money back.

Okay...

Obviously, she is not
mentally competent enough

to handle her finances.

This is like when my grandma
wanted to give all her money

to that orphanage, so they had
her diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

Here.

I can't believe I'm
losing all of my money

twice in one lifetime.

Who has an inhaler?

And check it. I even
put your name on there.

"Deke Mc-richy
Mc-never-had-to-work-for-anything"?

Oh, sorry, I probably should've added,

"Richy rich
pretended-he-was-poor-instein"

So they'd know it's you.

Here, I'll fix it.

Oh, yes. I treat myself well.

You know what, Max? Stop.

I've tried everything
to show you I'm not

Some cartoon rich guy,
and you still think I'm a joke.

You only see me as
my money, but I'm not.

That's how much money means to me.

But you were right.

It's not gonna work with us.

Max. Oh, I got your gift.

I love my new vibrator.

It's not a vibrator, Sophie.
It's a dustbuster.

Oh.

Well, there's no dust there anymore.

I'll be in my booth.

Waitress. Waitress.

"Waitress"? Who's she talking to?

Miss...

This salmon tastes like chicken.

That's weird, 'cause it's pork.

I don't need attitude
from some waitress.

Who is this waitress
you keep referring to?

Your job is to take my order,

put a smile on your face, and serve me.

Oh, hell, no!

I don't have to take this.

Let me show you something, doll.

This is my receipt from the
last time I used the atm.

You see where it says
"account balance" at the bottom there?

Read that number to me, please.

If you have $1 million,
why would you be working here?

Good question.

Hey.

You seem cranky.
You want to use my dustbuster?

That woman just asked me

if I have $1 million,
why am I working here?

That's what I've been saying.

I mean, I have $1 million.

That's what I've been saying.

I don't need to be in this dump!

Again, that's what I've...

You've been saying!
I know, I'm an idiot!

I'm keeping that money!

That's what I've been saying!

- Max, Caroline...
- No.

You don't even know
what I was about to say.

Whatever it is, no. We have $1 million.

Yeah, we have $1 million.

Yeah, we have $1 million, and I quit!

And I quit too, baby!

I have hated this hellhole from day one.

Sayonara, short stuff!

I don't know what's more offensive.

"Sayonara" or "short stuff"!

I would go with "sayonara," short stuff.

Wow.

That got off quicker than

a 12-year-old looking at Megan Fox.

Quick? I've been trying to get out
of this thing for three years.

This zipper is stuck!
This is like a horror movie!

Help me!
Get this damn thing off me!

Tear it off, cut it off,
light it on fire!

Well, watch my hair.

Oh, who cares! I'll buy new hair!

Damn it, I'll just go over.

Yes! We're out of here.

No more diner, no more cupcakes.

Wait, wait, no more cupcakes?

What are you talking about?

With all this money,
we can grow our business.

Oh, I'm not growing anything

except a big-ass weed plant
on my nightstand.

But it's our dream.

I don't need a dream.
Dreams are for poor people!

I have $1 million.

I'm not going to pastry school,

I might not even go to the bathroom.

And I am definitely
not getting out of bed.

I will never do anything again!

Oh, my God, I'll never
do anything again.

We're not quitting.

I knew it!

Between you and this zipper,
I'll never get outta here.

I can't. You heard what
I'd be like with $1 million.

I'd be dead at 30.

But isn't that what
you've always wanted?

Hey, Uncle Pennybags, you home?

I mean, you dumpster?

Hey, can I come in?

Or did you already move on?
'Cause I'd get it if you did.

Nah, come in. Just sittin'
in here fartin' diamonds.

Look, I think I owe you an apology.

You know how I called you a
lazy Mc-richy Rich who never

had to work for anything and
lives in an ivory dumpster?

Is this part of the apology

or just the recap of mean
things you've said to me?

Just listen.

Well, I was right, you never
did have to work for anything.

Okay, I'm starting to think you
don't know what an apology is.

But even though you never
had to work for anything,

You do.

You actually get up,
you go to pastry school,

And you build dumpsters,
you do lots of stuff.

Hey, you're not even
familiar with my charity:

Orgasms for old people.

I hope you're not joking.

Look, the truth is
I couldn't see past your money.

All I saw was Smurf.

And I thought witches and
Smurfs couldn't be together,

But I was wrong.

Yeah, you were.

Max, did you get back the check yet?

Because I just found a
different investment guy.

A legit one in Germany.

His name is Herr Schluffen.

Well, I'm sorry.
I'm giving it back right now.

Herr Schluffen can schluff off.

Wait, Max, can I hold the million?

For just one more second,
I want to be upper-middle class.

Caroline, give it back.

Synced and corrected by backinblack


Girls, prepare to be
more obsolete

than you already are.

Which will be hard.

You're one step
above newspapers.

Behold, the future!

Oh, no. I'm still here
in the future?

(mechanical chattering)

Or, Han, your sister's here.

Hello, hola, konichiwa.

I guess now's a good time
to admit

that I ate a bunch of shrooms
and I'm seeing

a robot in a bowtie.

This is a room service robot
that delivers food.

My aunt's Holiday Inn
went belly-up.

I got this and one night stand.

That's the only
one night stand

you're ever gonna get.

Must be a different kind
of room service

than they have at
Tuggington's Hourly Motel.

Where the first tug is free.

(mechanical chattering)

- R2, thank God.

I thought I lost you
when we blew up the Death Star.

Would you like a late check out?

Sorry, toots.
I checked out years ago.

R2, no!

Yoda's our friend!

HAN: Somebody help me!

If that thing could show
cleavage and steal silver wear,

I'd be out of a job.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I can't wait for our date
either, Bobby.

Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

You hang up first.

No, you hang up--
Oh, he hung up.

I'm liking this guy
more and more.

I know.
Isn't Bobby the cutest?

Not smoking Chinese baby cute,
but not bad.

Max, I'm so excited.

This is the first date
I'll be going on

since Julia Roberts could still
open a romantic comedy.

I'm still pissed at them
for stealing my life story

for "Pretty Woman."

Jason Alexander's character
was totally me.

For our date,
he's thinking of taking me

on an afternoon picnic
in the park.

The pretty one, where you crotch
punched that mime into a pond.

You know the fact
that Bobby's taking you

on a day date
is a bad sign, right?

It probably means he's married.

Or worse, afraid of the dark.

Actually, the day date
was my idea.

You know we're not
married, right?

That's not why I call you
my old lady.

It's cause you write
thank you notes

and use the word jeepers.

Jeepers, Max!

I just figured
if I go out at night,

you'll have to run
the dessert bar alone

and you've never
done that before.

I've also never flossed
my back teeth.

And they're fine
when it's not windy.

I got this.

Hey, girls.

I just thought I'd take a walk
and stretch my knees.

Then I remembered
I don't have any.

Earl, I'm going on
a night date, like a person.

Max will be running the dessert
bar and that'll be fine, right?

Ooh, speaking of disasters,
that reminds me,

I have to return
"Risky Business" to Blockbuster.

When do they close?

So it's gonna be
an early spring.

No. He saw his shadow
this year.

Know your facts.

Earl, you're supposed to
be in the diner.

I had to ask our shrimp supplier
to cover for you.

I thought your mother
was our shrimp supplier.

Han, I'm going on a night date,
like a person.

Max'll be running the dessert
bar and that'll be fine, right?

Sure, like when I had her
run the diner by herself.

Which never happened
because I'm not a damn fool!

Let's go, Earl.

All right, fine.

I left my knees there, anyway.

Hey, I was, uh--
I was just in the neighborhood

and thought I'd hop on
two subways and a Citi Bike

and come say hi.

A Citi Bike?

Oh, this city gal is flattered.

Jeepers.

Isn't he the cutest?

Oh, not dog running in his sleep
cute, but I'm all right.

Bobby, I have some good news.

I don't want you to think
I'm loose or fast

or whatever the kids say,
but I am available

for a night date,
like a person.

- Hey, really?
That's great.

I usually save my day dates
for my grandma.

She likes a noon dinner.

-I like a noon--
-No.

Since we're going out at night,

I can cancel
all the romantic errands

we were gonna run to the bank

and my dry cleaners.

Now I can take you to a movie.

There's this new theater
that has couches

and waiter service.

Wow.
We work in a restaurant

and we don't have
waiter service.

Next one. What do you do
if there's a fire?

Follow up question: did I
or did I not start said fire?

Either way, I'm cutting
a hole in someone.

Okay you failed
this quiz now twice.

Especially the essay portion.

I'm calling Bobby and canceling.

Oh. They're home.

He means, hey, girls.

How did you get
a key to our apartment?

They specifically say on them,

"Do not copy for Oleg."

I find that when you go
in a Home Depot pantless,

they'll do anything
to get you out quick.

We come down here
on our date nights

to pretend we're
two destitute girls

who are sleeping together
for warmth.

Why do you guys come here?

Why don't you go to, like,
I don't know, Olive Garden?

Staying in is a tradition.

You know, in Poland,
you really can't go outside

because of all the wild dogs.

And if it wasn't
for the wolves,

You wouldn't be able
to walk anywhere.

Of course, you still need
your vulture stick.

Speaking of vultures
circling a dead body,

Caroline's got a date tonight.

(laughs)

Oh, my God, Max.
That's a good one.

Say it again.

No, it's not a joke.

I'm really going on a date.

(laughs)

Stop it!
Oh, my gosh, I'm gonna pee.

I'm going to that new movie
theater with couches.

It's like watching at home,
but there isn't a giant spring

poking you in the butt.

Play your cards right,
there will be.

Here you go.
Two Liquor Doodles.

And speaking of
licking her doodle--

No.

What are you doing here?
I thought I left you

at the apartment.

Which is what my abductor said

when I ran into him
at Baskin-Robbins.

Wait, did he work there
or did you just want ice cream?

Because if he worked there,
why would you go--

Anyway, I'm having Bobby
pick me up here

so I can keep my hand
on the fire extinguisher

until we get to our
wherever it is he's taking me.

No. You don't trust me.

You think I'm gonna
mess this place up.

Ah, Caroline gone yet?

'Cause I got us some
high-grade pot--

to turn into the authorities
immediately.

Earl, you go AWOL more often
than Mischa Barton

on a movie set.

What do I have to do
to keep you in that diner?

Well a date with Halle Berry
would be nice.

I also wouldn't hate
minimum wage.

How about
a butterscotch pudding?

That works, too.

That pudding has saved me
thousands over the years.

And who told him about
minimum wage?

Will you just go
on your date already?

-(gasps) Ashley!
-Ashleigh!

(both scream)

both: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Oh, my God.
Sorority sisters?

Max, you hate them.

I mean,
I was a sorority sister.

You look so good!

Shut up, I gained, like,
two pounds.

Oh, you shut up.
You look like you're dying.

Just relax,
I'll take care of them.

And I don't mean
calling my friend Dmitri,

who has his own dumpster.

Oh, sorority sisters, huh?

Epsilon Phis!
And we haven't seen each other

in, like, three days.

Uh, that's pretty obvious.

Let me get you some menus.

Eh? Nobody got hurt.

I'd feel better if your eye
wasn't twitching like that.

Wow, Caroline,
you look beautiful.

Speaking of beautiful,
who built this awesome place?

This guy. I'm going out
with him tonight.

He's cute, too.

Okay, I know you're talking
about me, but I get jealous.

I'm gonna tell you
what I always told my mom:

go out, get plastered
and you don't have to wait

till the morning after
to take the pill.

That's just a name.

It's okay, I took mine
on the way over.

Have fun Max.
Do not have fun. Bye!

(blows raspberry) I can handle
a few sorority girls.

Let me make sure
I still have Dmitri's number.

(gasps) Bunny!

- Ashley! Ashleigh!
(all screaming)

God, they're multiplying.

Oh, you look so good!

-Oh, shut up.
-You shut up!

You guys should really
listen to each other.

Couches in movie theaters?

I feel like Kate Middleton
right now.

I'm glad you're
easily impressed.

For Valentine's Day, I'll take
you to the Super Target cafe.

Well I can't just sit
on that kinda news.

Let me just call Max
and tell her.

Nope, straight to her outgoing
fart message.

Bon soir, everybody.
My name is Marcel,

and I will be the curator
for this evening's

cinematic experience.

The film, which
Owen Gleiberman has hailed,

a Kubrickesque
tour de force,

will be screening in DCP--

Uh, yes? A question
from a fellow cinephile?

Do I have to order
the seasoned fries

separate from the regular ones
or can I just get them mixed?

It's a dollar extra.

I'll be taking orders
once the movie starts.

Whatever.

Hey, great question
about the fries.

I had a follow up
about free refills.

Everything okay?

I was just, um,
checking this place on Yelp.

And to see if the dessert bar
was on the news.

Or engulfed in flames.

Shh.

You saw the dancing hot dog.

No cell phones.

What are you guys doing here?

Did I cover my bed
in "Dexter" tarp for nothing?

We're on a date.

Trying like crazy
not to have sex.

Usually, when the lights go down
in the movie,

so do my pants.

and then, so do I.

And of course we would have
to see a super sexy poster

of Steve Buscemi
in the lobby.

Hi, I'm Bobby.
Nice to meet you.

Sorry, I'm no Steve Buscemi.
I had braces in high school.

You guys brought Barbara
on your date with you?

Of course not.
She's with the babysitter.

We used the carriage
to sneak in our dinner.

Hey, we're not gonna pay
movie chicken prices.

Oleg, tear me off a leg.

(ripping sound)

Good. Yeah.

(siren wailing)

Was that a siren?

Oh,
it's coming from the screen.

The movie's called "Sirens."

I know, but I thought I heard
another one under it

that sounded like it could be
heading for a dessert bar.

Are you not having a good time?

Do you not like movies?

Please tell me
you don't like plays.

No, I'm having a great time.

And please tell me you don't
consider musicals plays.

Hey, I don't wanna
check in on Max

'cause she'll think
I don't trust her.

So can you check in on Max?

Because I really don't
trust her.

Uh, I got chicken hands!

Why don't you ask
your boyfriend to do it?

First, we haven't discussed
labels yet.

And second, I don't want him
to think I'm not having fun.

I'm having so much fun.

I would go to a musical
if it was important to you

I'll do it.

Texting? Out.

And don't come back
until you gain some respect

for the art form.

Who ordered the chili dog
with the nachos on top?

Well it probably all
for the best.

Since you're leaving anyways,

you can check in on Max
in person.

I guess.

Since we're about
to chicken up your bed.

(together)
Epsilon Phi until we die!

Epsilon Phi until we die!

Ah, heard you the first time.
I'm working on it.

(sighs)

Aw, come on, Ashley!

That's something I'd expect
from Ashleigh.

Can you do something?

Uh, uhh.

Hey you, uh, they're trying to
let a poor girl in the sorority.

Who? Is she ugly?

There you go.
See? She's as annoying

as she was five minutes ago.

Now what do you people want?

Um, more shots.

Also, Ashleigh threw up
in Ashley's purse.

Ah, back from
the liquor store.

Sorry I took so long.

I didn't realize
I was at a Pottery Barn.

Well, while I've got
you confused,

How about you
get back to work

and bring out
these drinks for me?

I am not confused.
I realized

I'm a waitress
at this TGIFridays.

Congratulate us!

We've just gone two hours
without having sex.

Which breaks our old record
by pretty close to two hours.

You know, Caroline asked us
to check up on you

because she was worried.

We're not supposed to
tell you that.

But I had to leave
a half a roasted chicken

in the movie theater.

So I am!

Does she have any idea
what I've been through tonight

with these sorority girls?

(chuckles)
For all she knows, I'm sober.

Sorority girls, huh?

I was in a sorority once.

Until they found me.

What's going on?
We've been waiting

Is that a problem?
'Cause I'd hate to

have to say something on Yelp.

Yelp? Caroline checks that
more than she Googles herself.

Uh, not a problem at all.

Drinks and separate checks--

(laughs) whatever that is--
coming right up!

Thanks! You're the cutest.

No, you are.

Looks like someone's
in the weeds

and not just smoking it
for a change.

Don't just kneel there,
bring these drinks out.

I have to learn all of math
in ten minutes.

All right, I'll stay.

But only because I want you
to see how it feels

when the shoe is on the--

Serve the damn drinks!

She gets it.

How long you been working
at this Fridays, sonny?

Uh, is everything all right?

You've been to the bathroom
nine times.

Are you a drug addict?

"Candy Crush" junkie?

We can deal with it together.

I'm sorry, Bobby, but you know
how turtles can sense

if their turtle best friend
is stuck upside down

on its shell, its turtle legs
all wiggling in the air?

So it is drugs.

Good. "Candy Crush" is tough.

We went through that
with my mom.

It's a killer.
We almost lost our house.

No, Max and I are the turtles.

And I can feel she's trapped
on her back at the dessert bar.

All right, look,
I don't know Max that well.

But I've gotten to
know you a little bit

and you have a really good,

really beautiful head
on your shoulders.

You trusted Max. You should
trust your own instincts.

You're right.
I do have a nice shaped head.

And I'm gonna stop worrying
that she might

-burn the bar down.
-Good. What?

Seriously? I put a ton of work
into that place.

(laughs)

You know what?
This movie sucks.

Let's get out of here
and go get some dessert.

I know a great place.

That is so sweet.

And I was so worried
you'd think I was crazy.

Oh, you're bananas.

But I like bananas.

Not the fruit.
The texture grosses me out.

But you.

I could kiss you for that.

You know,
you actually could.

You're right, I can.

(siren wailing)

Yeah, we should get out of here.

(indistinct chatter)

Hello? It's taking longer than
it took me to almost graduate.

Just hang onto
your hair extensions.

(gasps)

They're obvious?

My turtle sense was right.

Max is on her back and she's not
under a boy turtle.

Maybe she's all right.
I don't smell fire

and everyone's shoulders
are still in their sockets.

Why are separate checks
taking so long?

Can we please get our change?

Um, you put the apps
on Bunny's bill, right?

'Cause she ate the most,
as per ush.

Stop telling people I eat!

Stop telling people
my LSAT scores.

Stop talking!
Now I have to start over.

I have a lot of numbers in
my head and they're all angry.

I have to help her.
Separate checks?

Max calls 13 "ten three."

Caroline, wait. Let her try
and handle this on her own.

Otherwise, we'll never be able
to go on a second date.

But she really nee--

There's gonna be a second date?

Okay, listen up, everybody!

Calm down!

Here's what we're gonna do
instead of separate checks:

I'm not good at math,
but I have been

a negotiations expert
for ten three years.

Ashley, you're gonna get
$6 from Bunny's PayPal account

and she's gonna do your nails.

Bunny, you're gonna
Venmo Amber $20

And she's gonna let you borrow
her gay friend Dave

for your sister's wed.
Everybody good?

You've got ten three minutes
to decide.

We're good.

Okay, problem solved.

Max, that was amazing.

I knew you could do that
on your own.

No you didn't,
you were spying on me.

Her turtle sense went off.

Is it strange that I'm a little
sad that you don't need me?

I didn't say I don't need you,
but you are a little sad.

Earl, it was a pleasure
waiting tables at your side.

You and I have a chemistry
you can't make in a lab.

You have a real strange way
of talking to dudes.

(chuckles)
Uh, hi.

Did you guys know
there are two naked people

eating chicken
off each other in there?

What? I haven't
chicken-proofed those sinks.

All right, I'm closing my eyes
and then I'm coming in.

Isn't he brave?

So did he bravely go
where no man has gone before?

Under your sweater?

No, but we were smooching
in the movie.

(gasps) Shut up!

-No, you shut up.
-No, really,

shut your damn mouth,
I'm exhausted.

(cash register dings)

(rock music)

* *

Pick up... chicken breasts.

The way I know you want it,
with the bone in.

We really should
hold a seminar

about sexual harassment
in the workplace.

Why? He's already
so good at it.

I'm serious.
How'd he like it

if we did that to him
every time we ordered?

Well,
let's find out.

Ordering.

One pastrami.

Can you do me a favor,
doll-face?

Make it so big and thick, you
can't get your mouth around it.

Can you do that
for me?

Yes,
and two matzo ball soups,

hold the balls.

Wait,
I'll hold the balls,

you just sit there
and look pretty.

And a cream of...

nope, can't.
Just grossed myself out.

When is it
going to get dirty?

Max, come out.

If I came out,
it would not be for you,

it's be for that
hot dragon tattoo girl.

Welcome, board members,
to the very first

financial assessment meeting
of Max's homemade cupcakes.

I was told
there would be a cheese plate.

After five months
in business,

we're showing a profit
of $725.

I have to say,
I'm a little disappointed.

Really? 'Cause, dude,
we have so far exceeded

where I thought we'd be
in five months.

Look, we have to find a way
to make more money on the side

to put into the business.

Or we could quit now,
while we're a success.

What are you
talking about?

It's only
gonna get worse.

Or it could get better.
Why would you even say that?

Because it's life, and life
gets worse, that's what it does.

On life's resume,
under special skills it says,

"good at
making things worse."

- Do you always go to
the worst-case scenario?

Do you think you could try
to be more optimistic,

and not expect the worst
all the time?

Who's that?
More optimistic, right?

On the other side of that door
is all the money you lost,

and then we move back
into your townhouse,

and I masturbate in your tub
for a change.

It was twice,
and you could have knocked.

Who is it?

Detective James, NYPD.

Wait, don't open it!
Don't open it!

Oh, smoked it tuesday.
Open.

Sorry to bother you, miss.
Do you live in this apartment?

I'm gonna tell you right now,
officer,

our names
aren't on the lease.

We're an illegal sublet
with no place else to go.

Please, mercy.

Sorry, officer,
it's her first raid.

Relax, the landlord
didn't send me.

What do you know about

the tenant who lives in the
apartment directly above you?

His name is Lou.

Leo?

Saul?

Am I even close?

His name's
Nirham Chaduri.

Oh, man, I wasn't even
on the right continent.

Is that Nirham Chaduri?

Been dead for two weeks.
Lived alone, nobody knew.

Cats eat his face?

Max, could you please
not be so dark?

Kittens eat his face?

What? I'm just trying to put
a more positive spin on things.

Where are you going
with that?

That's my good China
with huckleberry hound on it.

I'm making
a "hello" cupcake plate

for our neighbors
across the hall.

Oh, no, you're not.

It's weird
not to know your neighbors.

No, it's weird
not to know your father,

but by the time you're four,
you get over it and move on.

This is a mistake.

Who knows what's lurking
behind that door?

Yes, something awful,
like nice people,

who might look out for us,
or say, "hello," in the hallway

when they see you.

No matter what
comes out of there,

I will not be "hello-ing" it up
in the hallway.

You got lucky.
Get back in here.

Who is it, please?

- Caroline,
your next-door neighbor.

Hi.

Uh, is this a bad time?

Not at all.

One sec.
Hi.

I just wanted to introduce
myself and my roommate, Max.

There, and give you
these cupcakes.

That is so nice.

Well, it's the leash...
least... least I can do.

Well, I gotta go.

Well, if we ever get a dog,
we know who can walk it.

- Listen.
- I know.

It's only been
a few days,

and somebody's already moved in
upstairs.

And they are
playing music!

Music is coming
through the floor into my ears.

I blame you for this.

When you knocked on that door
across the hall,

you might have
opened a portal to hell.

There, you hear
the devil music?

I think
it's the bee gees.

Exactly.

And walking!

Walking and music,
we have to stop this right now.

It's 10:00, people are allowed
to walk and play music.

Your lack
of apartment knowledge

is really starting
to piss me off.

We have to show him right now
not to screw us.

I need paper.

- What are you doing?
I mean, besides over-reacting?

Writing
a threatening note.

If we don't shut this down now,
next thing you know,

someone's having
an academy awards party

in your living room.

Is that what you want?

Strangers passing out
mini Oscar statues

that say, "best nachos?"

"I have
an unregistered gun

and can shoot you
through the floor"?

You're coming in
really hot, Max.

We're not giving him this.

It'll start a bad dynamic
between us.

God, how I miss
the quiet, dead indian guy.

Okay, we're gonna
hit and run.

Oh, you mean
"run," literally.

Shh, listen.

Reading the note,

freaking out...

Music off,
problem solved.

Respect!
Never doubt, never doubt.

Crossing the floor
to the door,

Closing the door,

Coming down the stairs,

What do we do?

Move?

What's he look like?

He's got his finger
over the peephole.

Okay, game on. Back up!

This is my building,
I've got to take it back.

- Max, this is life, not
call of duty: Modern warfare 3.

Move.

What is meaning
of this horrible, horrible note?

Oh, you're not a man?

What kind of question
is this?

Do I look like a man?

No, but you clump around
up there like a man.

Max, please.

Did you write
this horrible, horrible note?

I did.

First day
in my new home

and I'm given this horrible,
horrible note, with threats.

Well, they're not
actually threats.

"I will gut you
like a hog."

To be clear,
I only skimmed the note.

Everything was happening
so fast.

Listen, we've obviously
gotten off to a bad start.

Please come in.

Why would I want to come in
with you horrible, horrible...

ooh, cupcake land.
Ooh.

Yes, we have
a cupcake business.

We're just starting,
but doing well.

Max is the baker.
Say hello, Max.

I know people
in the mob.

That's Max, and I'm Caroline.
You are?

Sophie Kuchenski.

Is that a polish accent
I'm detecting?

Yes.

I visited Warsaw once,
I love it.

Oh, 'cause I hate it.
Rats and pimps.

Why have you
not yet offered me cupcake?

It's the least thing you can do,
after horrible, horrible note.

Oh, sure.
Chocolate or vanilla?

Yes.

Why such sourpuss?

Sorry about that.
It's just, we work long hours

at the neighborhood diner,
and Max has another job as well,

and then she comes home and
she has to make the cupcakes.

Mmm.
So good.

Mmm.

How could someone so angry
make something so sweet?

She's not always
like this.

I'm usually like this,
just ask the previous tenant.

Oh, wait.
You can't.

You know, you two girls
are like these cupcakes.

One is dark and heavy
and one is light and fluffy.

I prefer the fluffy one.

Well, I think we've
made our point.

No music, no clumping,
I'll shoot you

through the floor,
thanks for stopping by.

I'm so glad we can
joke with each other already.

Sorry about the note,
can we start ov...

you have
the chanel allure lip gloss?

Yeah.

Mm, you know the chanel?

Know? Love.
I can't afford it any more.

Oh, take one.
I got handfuls in my bag.

Really?

Oh, that's so nice.

Both: Ahh.

Hey.

Hey! Hey!

Do I have to put you
on a leash?

Hey, we start again.

You take a chanel,
and I take more cupcakes to go.

Oh, sure.

Yes.

I knew it.
Bitch played us for cupcakes.

It's 3:00 A.M.
Why are you dressed?

Never took off my clothes,
'cause soldiers don't.

We have to be ready
when the enemy attacks.

Okay, you were right,
I was wrong.

Why do you have the broom?

'Cause I ran out
of finger bullets.

Wait, you're gonna fall.

I can't believe
we have a broom.

All this time I've been sweeping
with an us weekly.

I knew this would happen,
but I didn't say anything,

'cause you were all, "Max is
the worst-case scenario."

Well, we showed weakness
and now, look.

And by "we,"
I mean "you."

Deal with this,
cupcake thief!

Yeah, one more time,
and hard.

Okay, now she broke our house.
We're in a war.

She wants a piece of me,
she's gonna get it.

Where are my heels?

I mean,
who did she think I am?

Someone she can just buy off
with a tube of chanel?

Well, your legs
did kind of snap back

over your head pretty quick
when she offered it.

I thought you were
man with pizza.

You have a porch swing
in there.

You have
an electric cigarette.

What is it
you two girls want?

Uh, I forgot.

Just so thrown by the swing
and the everything.

Oh, you're taking advantage
of us

by still playing that music
after we talked.

You two are harshing
my marshmallow.

So I'm gonna have to call
my friend the landlord tomorrow

and tell him about
the horrible, horrible note.

Mmm.

Oh, my God,
she's a hooker.

I've been using
a hooker's lip gloss.

She's not a hooker.

Oh, good.

She's too old,
she's a madame.

You've been using
an old hooker's lip gloss.

Max, look, my lip.

Is this something?
I feel like I'm getting one.

For the last time,
you cannot get a herpes breakout

in under ten hours.

- You're right, now I'm jumping
to the worst-case scenario.

Maybe her lip gloss
wasn't a herpes breeding ground.

Maybe she's not a prostitute.
Maybe those young girls

weren't being held there
against their will.

Yeah, maybe she just
has sleepovers

with women on swings
in the their nighties.

You know,
like people do.

Welcome
to Williamsburg diner.

How many in your party?

What kind of question
is this?

One,
I am my own party.

I take booth.

Now, now, who is that
over there?

Our new
upstairs neighbor.

Earl, does she look
like a prostitute to you?

Well, I don't like to
judge a book by its cover,

but if she was a book,

she'd be the kind
that other books pay for sex.

Sophie just came in,
Earl thinks she's a hooker,

and now my lip is feeling
very courtney love.

I invited her here
for a free meal,

we have to make this work out
for us.

Last night, she threatened to
call her "friend," the landlord,

and that can
never happen.

We're illegal tenants,

and I'd rather have a noisy roof
over my head than no roof.

Let me do the talking.

You're too upset, and you might
say something insulting.

Like what?
"Hi, thanks for the lip gloss

"and the series of
uncomfortable conversations

with every lover I'll have
for the rest of my life."

You don't need
to tell them,

they'll figure it out
eventually.

Hi, thanks for coming in.

I like the uniforms.

You fill out
the front nicely,

and you with no boobs,
short-short skirts.

Smart girls.

Uh, we just wanted to
offer you a free dinner,

as our way of
apologizing.

So are you ready
to order?

What kind of question
is this?

Did you see
this horrible, horrible menu?

We can't have
nice conversation here.

Tomorrow I take you
to nice place, my treat.

Oh, you don't have
to do that.

No, no, I, too,
want to apologize.

You know, after you two left
the other night,

some of my girls said
that I was harsh on you.

Yes, all those girls
work for me.

Excuse me, I have to go
to the ladies' room right now

and look at my lips.

Thank you so much
for inviting us.

Are you enjoying
that beluga?

Mmm, so much. Thank you.

I haven't had caviar
in forever. Mmm.

Legs over your head much?

So, sourpuss,
you don't like caviar?

No, I'm more of
a cheeseburger kind of girl.

- Oh.
- This place is busy.

The waiters must
make a fortune.

Oh, yeah,
300, 350 a night.

What do you girls make?

60 to 80
on a good night.

And how do you expect you will
accomplish cupcake business

on money like this?

Well,
we're just starting out.

Yes, but at this rate,
it will take forever.

You know, I, too,
have big dream.

I am building summer house
by lake in Poland.

You want to see?

Oh, you have pictures?

No, I have house.

This is model
from the architect.

And I take it everywhere I am,
to remember where I'm going.

It's cool.

See, girls like you
should be making more money.

Maybe you could consider
coming to work for me.

- Sophie!
- Oh.

Thank you for sending girl
to my apartment yesterday.

Oh, did she do the job?

Oh, like no one
ever before.

Down on all fours,
under, over,

under again.
Oh!

Well, my girls don't leave
until you're satisfied.

Maybe she can come
two times a week.

She can come
whenever you want her to come.

Are these
two of your girls?

Well, we were just
discussing that.

Well, this one here looks like
she can take a lot.

Uh, thanks?

My friend Yanni
is at the bar.

Since his divorce, he's
in great need of your service.

Prosze.
Oh, yes.

Uh, excuse me, and, um,
don't touch my house.

I can't believe
she would actually consider

asking us
to be prostitutes.

I know.

I mean, me, I get,
but you, I don't see it.

You heard the guy, I look like
I could "take a lot."

Max, it's not funny.

Isn't it bad enough I may have herpes

from her chanel gloss?

Of course we're not
gonna do it, but come on,

you'd be
a terrible hooker.

Thank you,
I would be a terrible hooker.

I have a heart, and soul,
and dreams,

and want to fall in love
and have a family.

Oh, just say it,
you're bad in bed.

Let's get out of here.

I mean, really,
who does she think I am?

Someone who would just
sell myself to have nice things?

Let me just suck down a little
more of this, and we're off.

If we
walk out of here now,

we can just keep walking
to the homeless shelter.

Well, I'd rather be homeless
than a hooker.

Here she comes.
Sit down!

Let's thank her
and politely decline.

Okay, back to
what we were discussing.

Uh, thanks.

We appreciate the offer,
but we are going to pass.

So you don't want to
accomplish your dream?

Well, uh, I'm not exactly sure
those two things line up,

but thanks.

I thought you were smart girls.

We are smart girls,

and smart girls
don't have to sell their bodies

to accomplish their goals.

Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

It works for you, but us?

Well, she's bad in bed
and I have a sour puss.

What guy wants to pay for that?

You think
I am prostitute?

No, everyone has swings
with girls in pajamas.

My business card.

Home cleaning service.

She runs
a cleaning company.

"Sophie's choice."

You realize
what this means?

- We insulted
a hard-working woman

who was trying to help us
attain our goal?

Yes.

And I don't have herpes!

I should have
listened to you.

Meeting neighbors
is a big mistake.

And meeting neighbors
and calling them a prostitute?

Bigger mistake.

Plus, we have to kick in
60 for the check.

What can we
possibly say to her?

That we're sorry, and please
keep playing the bee gees

day or night
as loud as she wants.

Not a good idea
to be smiling right now.

I'm just so happy
I don't have herpes.

Hi, is this
a bad time?

Yes. Yes, I'm in the middle of
having sex for money

with every man
in Brooklyn.

What do you horrible,
horrible girls want?

Here, you left
part of your dream on the table.

And we want
to apologize.

I'm new at this whole
being neighborly thing.

What does the fluffy one
have to say?

Thank you for being
so generous,

and for offering to help us
make more money

to accomplish our dream.

And this is supposed
to make me feel better?

You called me prostitute.

Actually,
it's kind of a compliment

that we thought
you were stunning enough

that men would pay
to have sex with you.

This is true.

Come on in.

♪ Thinking about
those people... ♪

Saturday night fever
is my favorite movie.

Look at him.
He's so sexy.

He's not that cute,
kind of oily.

You're right.

She would have made
terrible prostitute.

That's a nice TV.

Yeah, brand-new.

I have all my girls over
the other night

for viewing sleepover party.

It's also 3-d.

- Does it come with
3-d glasses?

Yeah,
in the drawer there.

- Here.
- Max, it's not a 3-d movie.

- Who cares?
It's 3-d glasses.

Come on,
you're always talking about

wanting us to see things
differently.

Oh, so cool.

This swing
is a brilliant idea.

Yeah, it's for my porch
at lake house.

But why wait?

Dream is now.

♪ Ha-a-ah ♪

♪ More than a woman ♪

Okay, Max.

How would you describe
our apartment?

And I've already ruled out

"worse than that girl-pit
in silence of the lambs."

Well, at least she had some
silence once in awhile.

Look, no one's gonna pay money
to rent this dump.

We haven't in six months.

Everyone else in williamsburg
is making money

renting their crappy places
on airbnb.

It's all how you describe it.

So let's start lying.

This is a fantastic idea
and I really want to do this.

First question:
"Describe your neighborhood."

Run-down with a bunch of rats.

Old-world charm.
Pet-friendly.

"What type of people
live there?"

Junkies, whores, homeless.

Actors.

"Do you have a hot tub?"

Sometimes.

"Gym?"

Two.
Gay Jim upstairs,

and straight Jim
across the hall

who's only gay
when he's drunk.

"When is your space available?

Always, sometimes, one time."

Oh, just like our sex lives.

Always for me,
sometimes out of boredom,

and one time for you.

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ¶

Earl, guess what Max and I did.

I know what you didn't do.

Clean this dessert carousel.

There's a Napoleon in here
since Napoleon.

We rented our apartment
on airbnb.

You rented to arabs?

Well, good luck
getting it back.

They tend to be
a tad territorial.

Airbnb is an agency
that rents to out-of-towners

and I'm guessing local men
cheating on their wives.

Well, I did it.

I know.

When you were 18
with prince Harry.

Or so you say.

We have three offers
for our apartment.

How?

Let me rephrase that.

How!

I found the perfect
sales pitch.

"Stay at the place
where dreams die"?

"Have the authentic
williamsburg experience."

Oh, you mean getting clumsily
felt up

by a guy who looks like he came
from the gold rush?

Anyone can stay at a hotel.

But how often can you say
you went to New York

and stayed at a "Brooklyn
bohemian barn apartment

with a live-in horse"?

Girl, you are good.

So now we just have to pick
who gets our apartment.

A guy looking to get away
from it all.

That's a suicide.

You're right.
We lie, they lie.

Um, a married couple
looking to reconnect.

Murder-suicide.

And finally, a girls' getaway
weekend

for some fashion model friends.

A couple of chubby girls
looking to murder

some pints of Ben and Jerry's.

With maybe a sui-side
of Mac and cheese.

Hey, everybody.

Yeah, the temperature
be droppin'

and the bitches
be nippin'.

I need a hot chocolate.

I'm right, Sophie.

And I'm right here, Earl.

I mean, I get it,

but bro code, man.

Well, big news.

I'm going on a trip.

Mushrooms or acid?

I'm going to Vermont!

Oh, you're gonna be gone?

Would you mind letting us stay
upstairs at your place?

We're renting out
our apartment.

You're renting out
that dump?

Oh, are they filming
survivor at your place?

[Coughing]

So when are these losers
arriving?

They're not losers.

They're just girls paying us
to have a fun weekend

in our apartment.

What losers!

[Knock at door]

Now that is a hand
that's scooped some ice cream.

Hi, are you Caroline?

Oh, my god.
They really are models.

Hi, I'm Lily.

Oh shoot, now I'm gay.

Lily?
As in Lily aldridge?

And I'm Martha.

Hunt?
Martha hunt and Lily aldridge?

Max, do you know who they are?

Sure do.

This one is the girl
that I leave this one for.

No, Max, they're all
Victoria's secret models.

Yeah, we all wanted to hang out
in New York

before we leave for London.

We're doing a fashion show
there.

I worked at the Victoria's
secret at the mall for one day.

Got fired for eating
panda express over the thongs.

This is Max.
I'm Caroline.

I used to be rich.

I just felt like I needed
to say that.

And these are our friends,
Petra, Gabriella, and rina.

(All three)
Hi.

What are the odds you're all
named after Columbus's ships.

Come in. Welcome to
"the williamsburg experience."

It's bigger than it looks
in the photo.

Well, I shaved of a couple
of inches for the photo.

You know the drill.

So why the hell are you staying
here?

Is this training
for when your looks run out?

Oh, look.
The kitchen is so cute!

Question: How do you walk
the runway blind?

It's just that we stay
at the same four seasons

all the time.

Well, you will experience
at least two seasons here,

'cause the thermostat's broken.

It's 40 outside
and 100 in here.

So as advertised,
this is our sauna.

And our bohemian barn's
right out that door.

Just follow
the temperature drop.

Max, super models are staying
at our apartment.

It's so exciting,
I want to tell all my friends.

I guess I just did.

I see you met Chestnut.

That's his real mane,
not extensions.

Also per our ad,
a charming skylight.

In case you want to sit under
the stars

and have a little peace
and quiet.

Hey, girls!

Come up already.

I want to get
to my college reunion.

Can you believe
it's been 10 years?

Wow, time sure does lie--

I mean, fly.

(Martha)
- You talk to your neighbors?

I talked to my neighbor once
and the next thing you know,

I have this long letter
from Naomi watts

saying, "leave my husband
alone."

So we've known each other
like five minutes already.

Where's my free bra?

I mean, all that's left
of this one is the frames.

Trust me, it's like
a burlesque show under here.

Sophie's apartment is amazing.

It looks like an easter bunny
banged a golden girl.

That was some showerhead.

I'd marry it,
but it's already attached...

To the wall.

Max?

Here!

Oh, this bed is like being
in the womb

without all the second-hand
smoke.

Martha and Lily
were super-sweet.

So exciting to be back
hanging with celebrities.

Yeah and maybe now you can get
a new celebrity story.

I was getting really tired
of hearing how someone thought

you were Gwyneth Paltrow
from behind.

Still flattering.

[Laughter]

Laughter?

Coming from our apartment?

What do you think
they're laughing at?

Probably found our account
balance on an atm slip.

I bet Martha said something
funny.

She's hilarious.

You know, for someone who's
so pretty,

she never had to develop
a personality.

I'm gonna go see.

Max, give me a shove.

This is good practice
for the eventual cliff.

[Indistinct chatter]

(Lily)
Beers and wings.

(Martha)
Beers and wings.

Now it's a party.

Max, you know how when it gets
hot down there,

we just sit, sweat,
and point the fan at our junk?

They do it a little differently.

They are dancing
in their underwear,

drinking beers.

So? The guy on the corner
does that all the time.

[Models toasting beers]

I can't take my eyes
off those beers.

(Lily)
Hey! Hi, you guys.

(Caroline)
Great, now we're Justin bieber!

(Lily)
You wanna come down,
and have some beers,

and cool off?

Be right down!

Now I wish I had those wings,
I could get down there faster.

Okay. So what is this big news?

Did the health inspector
find out

that the imitation crab meat
is cat?

Technically,
it's imitation cat,

but that's not what
we're announcing.

I'm here.

And make this snappy.
I'm in the middle of something.

Puberty?

No. I was on a call
with Ripley's believe it or not

to inform them that you still
work here.

And they didn't believe it.

Okay. We have some friends
coming in for a meal

and we don't want you guys
to embarrass us and overreact.

Darlin', I don't overreact.

I'm 70-something years old
with a history of heart trouble.

I keep it in check.

Hey, Max!

And I keep my heart pills
in my pocket.

Excuse me,
much as I enjoy the view,

I really want that
"100th birthday" shout out

from al roker.

Yes, they're Victoria's secret
models and our friends.

Last night we all stayed up late
trashing Kate moss.

Models in my diner!

Oh, no.
I wore the wrong sweater vest.

You also wore the wrong face,
body, and personality.

Max, let's go say hi.

How do I look?

Like a waitress.

Damn it, it's the waitress
uniform, isn't it?

What's up, homies?

What's up, homie?

I love my life again.

Well, it's been a whole day
since we met,

so where's that free bra?

Max!

What? This one's
on it's last legs.

Last night I heard it coughing.

Could also use some new
underwear.

Mine are running on fumes.

I just texted David.

He's coming.

This is going to be
an amazing party.

Party?
- Yeah.

We're having some
friends over.

Cool.

Yeah?
- Yeah.

And like Max said, "cool!"

Jeez, pull it back.

You're acting needier
than Sofia vergara

on a red carpet.

Big fan.

Big, big fan.

Compliments of the chef.

My specialty, popsicles.

I find they taste best
when sucked slowly,

using plenty of tongue,
facing the kitchen.

I can't believe
we're not invited

to the biggest party
in our apartment

since those ants found
your jelly beans.

Yoo-hoo!

Hi, so we're just up here
hangin' out.

Doin' our thang.

(Lily)
Oh, sorry, girl.
Did we wake you?

Go back to sleep.

"Go back to sleep"?

Why does she think
we're so lame?

Um, I don't know.

Maybe it's 'cause you're
throwing around words

like "yoo-hoo" and "thang,"
like a mom bringing cheetos

down to a slumber party.

This is your fault.

They were obsessed with us
until you started asking

for bras like some bra-less
homeless person.

We're never gonna sleep
with all that music.

Check the drawer,
Sophie must have ear plugs.

I mean, she lives upstairs
from you.

I found plugs, but I don't think
they're for your ears.

It's fine, we'll just pop
downstairs and say hello.

Fashion's my scene.

Know what I'm seeing?
That price tag.

Oh, tuck it back in,
I have to return it.

Okay.
Remember our deal.

I got up and got dressed
so you're my slave for life.

Oh, hi, girls.

I thought you were the man
with the Greek food.

Wow, I have definitely got to
start waxing my upper lip more.

Sophie, why aren't you
in Vermont?

Oh, I lied.

I didn't go to Vermont.

I mean, it's far
and I'm not a lesbian.

No, I stayed in town
to spy on Oleg.

I mean, I know you girls think
that I'm perfect,

but I have trust issues.

Well then, whose apartment
is that?

I'm staying at Jim's.

Straight Jim's or gay Jim's?

Sophie, you forgot your purse.

Oh, I think this is mine.

Just kidding, it's yours.

What's up, salt n' pepa?

(Both)
Gay Jim's.

Oh, girls, please don't tell
Oleg that I'm here.

You know, I've been following
him around

to see what he would do
if I was not in town.

And so far, you know,
he's been cool.

But you know the old saying:

"Cheat on me once,
shame on you.

Cheat on me twice,
your balls are in a jar."

Oh, my god! There's a man
standing in our doorway.

I have a doorman again.

Weird to see a man
standing in our doorway

without a warrant,
an eviction notice,

or a Bible.

Excuse me, this is our
apartment.

Yeah, we live here
all the time.

No biggie.

No biggie, and no electricity,
no lease-y.

Hi, I'm Caroline.
This is Max.

We live here.

Not according to the list.

Sir, look, we do live her.
I have a key.

The key is to be on the list,
which you are not.

Okay, I can prove we live here.

Go over to the window,
kick the side of radiator,

a panel will open up.

You'll find a half-smoked joint
and another half-smoked joint.

Proving--

what? That you're a poor
pot head?

This is crazy.

I can't believe I'm begging
to get into a place

I've been trying to get out of.

It's a very exclusive party.

It's a dump.

I should know.
I live here.

(Caroline)
This night couldn't get any
worse.

Turn that light off.

I'm watching the Victoria's
secret super model party

with my night vision goggles.

And updating.

Oleg, how did you get in here?

How do you think?

It's my girlfriend's apartment.

I broke in.

Yes, Oleg, it's your
girlfriend's apartment

where you're sitting
in the dark,

watching models out the window
with night vision goggles.

Hey!
My pants are on!

No, they are not!

Not my fault.

Five Victoria's secret
super models downstairs?

They took themselves off.

So what are you saying?
You're the victim here?

What would Sophie say
if she came home

and saw you sitting here?

She'd say,
"stop hogging the goggles."

Oleg, let me just say this:

Vermont is closer than you
think.

I don't know where
this argument is going,

but I'm going to that damn
supermodel party.

Oleg, it's late, I'm gonna
lay this on the line for you.

You're no George Clooney.

You're not even George Costanza.

These sheets are amazing

and you are never gonna do
better than Sophie.

She is hot and clearly
has no sense of smell.

I love Sophie.

I'll go home.

On second thought,
I don't trust myself

to walk by your apartment.

Better lock me in here.

(Lily)
Caroline! Max!
Come down here! Hurry!

I knew it! See, Max?

They're begging us to come.

I'm back again.

Are you coming?

Oh, let me think.

Downstairs with an open bar
or up here,

alone, with Oleg
in his tighty-not-that-whities?

Should we tie you up?

No, it'll just make me hornier.

I knew they wanted us
to come to the party!

How could they not?

Last night I taught
Petra how to eat bread

without tearing it
into little pieces first.

don't try it.
I was a Navy seal.

You think you're tough?

I lived in a refrigerator box
for a month.

With no top.

Not the box.
Me.

(Lily)
Max, Caroline, get in here!

Hey! See we were invited.

'Cause we're "a" list.

The toilet is clogged and I need
you to take care of it, please.

"A list" as in "a" janitor list.

I don't know what to do.

Can one of you call
the concierge?

Sure. Caroline!

Wait, wait, wait--
you didn't just call us

down here 'cause the toilet's
clogged, did you?

No.

Okay, good.

The kitchen sink
is backed up, too.

But, toilet, I got this.

I was almost born in one.

Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

All right, everyone just calm
down.

No need to overreact.

And there's the pool
we mentioned in our ad.

Oh, boy.

Yup, we got some floaters.

Caroline, I'm gonna need
the plunger

and a lobotomy.

This happens with vintage
toilets.

Part of their old-world charm.

We got some charm
stuck on your loofah.

Hey guys, remember last night

how we just bit
into that bread

without chewing it?
Good times.

I need that damn plunger,
I don't want to die this way.

Got it,
but it's caught on something.

[Grunts]

[Screaming]

What kind of a dump is this?

Hey! You wanted the williamsburg
experience, this is it!

Good news, Martha.
I have your flat iron

looking pretty much
back to normal.

Oh, that's good.
Keep it.

Again, sorry about your cashmere
sweaters in here.

But when we ran out
of paper towels,

you did scream, "just use
anything, make it stop."

And of course, we'll pay
to have them all dry cleaned.

Oh, that's nice.
Keep them.

Okay, we can leave.

I am off the phone
with my therapist.

And it goes without saying,
we won't charge you guys

for this weekend.

No way.
Here.

You are taking this check
and my therapist's phone number.

I do not know how you are
standing up without him.

What? Come on,
this is nothing.

One month, the floor actually
opened up and swallowed us.

Yeah, we've been through worse.

Oh, it's really cool the way
you two support each other.

Yup, we're a pair
of support hose.

And speaking of support--

here, Max.

No way!

Look, Caroline,
it's a bra-nanza!

And, Caroline, since you don't
really need to wear a bra...

Here.
This apartment may be hell,

but you are a real angel.

Aw, my own wings?

Thank you, guys.

Hey, can I ask you something?

As long as it doesn't have
anything to do with rats.

How come you didn't invite us
to the party?

What? I thought Martha did.

I thought Lily did.

(Both)
Model moment!

Pick-up, Caroline!

Yup, I always knew
you would die here.

Pick-up, Max!

Looking good, Max.

After you drop that,
have Caroline come back here

and lock me in the walk-in
till Sophie gets home.

Max, I just realized we're kind
of the supermodels

of waitressing.

And I just realized my boobs
aren't always supposed to hit

my side.

Table for two.

And don't worry, he just went.

So did the guy at booth three.
(laughs)

Max, that cop has
a drug-sniffing dog.

So, it was nice knowing you.

(gasps)

What's that, now?

-You're moving out?
-Max, put that away!

It smells like Willie Nelson's
bandana drawer in here.

Max, have you seen
the olicepay ogday?

Uh, that pot was too strong.

There's a chipmunk
talking to me.

Heavens, that's
a drug-sniffing dog!

Earl will spend the rest
of his life behind bars.

So, like, two weeks?

Earl, heads up.
Narc dog at 1:00.

Or it might be 6:00.

But it's definitely 420.

So, she can bring
that dog in here,

but I can't bring
my emotional support hooker.

I can't watch a dog
tear Earl to pieces.

Hey there, fella.
Sit.

All right,
now give me that paw.

Now here's what I got for you.
There you go.

I have a way with dogs.

Well, my marijuana biscuits do.

That's why I call them
Hush Puppies.

Hey, Han, if it's cool,
me and the dog

are gonna go see
the new Star Wars movie.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Max, guess what Bobby and I
are doing tomorrow night?

Where have I been dying to go?

Besides a doctor's office
that's not in a Chipotle.

Sorry, Dr. Pizza Hut
has a waiting list.

Hey, everybody!

Oh, I'm worried
that Barbara's not smart.

Yeah, she doesn't even
return my e-mails.

I think she has Oleg's DNA.

So do most of the chairs
in here.

That's why I bring my chair
from home every day.

I mean, it's awkward
on the subway,

but I don't wanna sit
on those seats either.

Sophie, don't blame me.
My family's very smart.

We won Family Feud in Ukraine,

and it takes intelligence
to kill another family.

Who are we kidding?

You're a gorgeous moron.

But what are we gonna do
with a dumb baby?

Maybe we should ask Han.

He's a dumb baby.

Hey, don't call Han
a dumb baby.

He managed to pull
that stupid vest

over his giant potato head
all by himself.

Nope.
I had to help him.

Starting to think the Splenda
packet I came out for

wasn't worth it.

-Hey, gorgeous.
-Hello, yourself, beautiful.

Bobby, great news--guess what
we're doing tomorrow night?

Tomorrow night?
I can't.

I have a hobby that I haven't
told you about

because I don't think
it's something you'll like.

Oh, so is your hobby getting to
the point of a story quickly?

It's definitely
not acknowledging

my new Caesar salad recipe.

Still waiting.

Still nauseous.

Well, I bet you Bobby's into
doing dead people.

Yeah, he just has that look.

Bobby, for the love of God,
just tell me.

Whatever hobby you have,
it can't be worse than that.

Fine, Caroline, I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

I like to bowl.

And you're sure you don't wanna

go with the dead people thing?

But bowling's just
a hobby, right?

Something you only do--

Every Tuesday night.

I'm on a team.
I have a locker at the alley.

And that tattoo
I told you was the moon,

it's a bowling ball.

Why didn't you tell me?

We don't talk about me a lot.

I thought it would
be more important

to tell you about my nut allergy
when I had the floor.

You have a nut allergy?

Bowler?
Nice!

I was on a bowling team
in juvie.

We were called
The Girls Who Escaped

when the Guards Took Us
to the Bowling Alley.

That'd be hard
to put on a shirt.

Oh, we didn't wear shirts.

Caroline, I knew bowling
wouldn't be your thing.

You don't pronounce any
of the Ns in Au Bon Pain.

That's because it's
(in French accent) Au Bon Pain.

We can have separate things.

Bobby, you know what?
Part of being in a relationship

is being open
to trying new things.

And since I'm not ready to try
being on top yet,

I'm gonna come watch
you bowl tomorrow.

Really?
Okay, great.

Hey, Max, you wanna come too?

Got some cute guys
on my bowling team.

Well, just some guys
that aren't that fat.

It's a bowling team.

Beer-based recreation?
Men with curves?

Are we going to
a bowling alley or heaven?

Max, I'm ready to go bowling.

You look like you're ready
for a greaser

to feel you up
at Make Out Point.

I've waited long enough
to have a boyfriend.

I can learn to like anything.

I mean,
it's not like it's bowling.

(gasps)
Oh, my God, it's bowling!

Well, I loved it.

But I hung up my back brace
after I bowled a 300.

I wanted to go out on top,
like Rob Schneider.

(knock at door)

And from what I hear,
apparently not you.

Hi, girls.

Yeah, Barbara's even dumber
than I thought.

Yeah, she had a play date
with the baby next door.

And he can read.

Jimmy?

He's 37.

He's a little person.

And a tax attorney.

Well, I did think it was odd
that he lived alone.

We're taking Barbara bowling.

Between the flashing lights
and the fist fights,

nothing's more stimulating
for a baby's brain

than a bowling alley.

How about a book?

On bowling?

So, this is a bowling alley.

This actually isn't so bad.
(bowling pins clatter)

What was that?

The sound of people
going nowhere.

Hey!

If you're here for the
sock hop, it was 40 years ago.

I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
You look sexy.

Thank you.
I'm here to support you

because this is what you love.

And what you love, I love.
(bowling pins clatter)

That seriously has to stop.

Hey, this is Frank.
He's the star of our team.

Tell 'em about yourself, Frank.

Well, I'm the star of our team.

I also enjoy dinner.

Yes!
Cute and dumb.

Where have you been all my life?

Well, I was in high school
for ten years.

All right, let's bowl.
(bowling pins clatter)

Whoo!

We're going towards the sound?
(bowling pins clatter)

Wow.
A curtain on the sex booth?

Classy place.
They had the same thing

on the sex booth where we voted.

You mean tried to vote.

I mean, I barely started
pulling your lever

before they kicked us out.

Barbara, Barbara,
what do you think?

You feel smarter yet?

You know what?
This baby's harder to read

than Chelsea Handler's memoir.

Oh, look, Oleg.
She likes the claw machine.

This is the first thing
she's been interested in

since she saw that lady fall
down the stairs in our building.

(laughs)
That was hilarious.

She was carrying
a casserole bowl.

You know, I am gonna
win her a stuffed animal

and show her
we may not be geniuses,

but damn it, we can
operate tiny cranes.

Now what's this knobby thing do?

So this is the rest of our team.
Bernie, Lynette,

there's Frank again,
who's currently trying

to drink a Sprite
through a wrapped straw.

So cute how he doesn't
know stuff.

And these are the bowling wives.
No offense, Wayne.

Oh, none taken.
I'm a pair of sensible earrings

away from being my mother.

So this is the practice for
the title game tomorrow night.

We win that, we get to go
to the championships in Detroit.

We win that,
we get to leave Detroit.

Oh, cool, I still have to pick
up my last check from Chrysler.

He was my pimp.

Uh, do the bowling wives
have to go to that--

get to come to that?

Sure, that'd be great.

This could be our thing.
You could be my bowling wife.

Before I say yes,
is there any way

the bar here serves white wine?

Well, this is what couples
do for each other, right?

I'm sure your spouses
support you

in whatever's important to you.

Bernie missed my swearing in
as a Federal judge last week.

But he bowled a 180,
so it was worth it.

Today's my birthday.
I'm one year cancer free.

Lynette didn't even know
I was sick.

Let's go, Frank.
Shake it for mama!

Those ten years in high school
did nothing for him.

(cheering)

I'm up.
Good luck two-step.

* Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Let's go, Bobby!
Do a good jobby!

If Frank does a good jobby,
I might just give him one.

B-O-B-B-Y, I could be his alibi.

'Cause he's bowling.
He's bowling.

(cheering)

Hey, hey.
You wanna cut that out?

We want them to lose.
If they win tomorrow,

the season goes on
for two more months.

Haven't we already
been here two months?

The foot spray plays games
with your mind.

Max, can you come sniff me?

I was hoping the sewer smell
from our shower

would cover the stink
from the bowling alley,

but I think they just
joined forces.

If you keep smelling like
sewers and bowling alleys,

we're gonna have to have sex.

Well, unfortunately for you,

I won't be smelling like
a bowling alley anymore

because I'm gonna tell Bobby
that bowling

should be his thing.

And waiting for him cutely
at home will be mine.

Wow.
Onto something interesting,

Frank came over last night.

You guys had sex?

I didn't hear you
ring your sex bell.

Well, we tried to,
but he just seemed confused

so I let him go to sleep.

But I did put
those hands to work.

I didn't hear
your hand stuff buzzer.

I had him work on my laces.

You didn't hear my laces kazoo?

Hey, Max?

I got all the knots
out of your shoes.

If I can teach him how to have
sex and how to climb onto a bed,

I'm locking this down.

Hey, thought I'd surprise you,
bring you some coffee.

-Oh.
-Bobby, what are you doing here?

This isn't the bowling alley.

Well, I'm glad I found him.
His mom was looking for him.

Come on, Frank, let's go.
We gotta get ready for the game.

Bye.
I'll see you later at the alley.

No--okay.

So, can I call you?
(crunching)

-Ow!
-(gasps)

Please tell me that wasn't
his bowling hand.

Caroline, what did
you do to Frank?

He's our best player.

It was totally an accident.

I support your hobby.
I was looking forward

to coming tonight and not
waiting here, cutely.

I'm fine.

Is my pinky supposed to be
my longest finger?

What are we gonna do?

Well, like I told the producers
of Deadliest Catch,

looks like Captain Max
is coming out of retirement.

Good thing I still have
my bowling glove.

Max, that's an oven mitt.

That's how good I am.

No pressure,
but if you blow this,

I may never get married.

Oh, please, I once had to bowl
to get out of North Korea.

Max Black, Max Black!

She bowled to get
her freedom back.

That is a very specific cheer.

(grunts)

(cheering)

Shabooya!

You like that, suckers?

Bowling is not just for guys
with their third DUI anymore.

Max, that was amazing.

The strike, I mean--what you're
doing now is very off-putting.

Well, it makes more sense
if you imagine she's riding

a very small unicorn
named Tito.

-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

Look at this poor sucker.

I wasted $400 in quarters
yesterday on this thing.

Good luck, kid.
(laughs)

Oh.
He won.

Well, between Earl's
claw-like hand

and the fact that Han was born
in one of these machines,

we've got a dream team here.

Now this is our Ocean's 1 1/2.

Now, you promised, if I win
Barbara the stuffed animal,

you'll come to my live action
 Clue party.

I'll be playing Professor Plum.

Reimagined as an English dandy
with a nose for trouble.

Great, and I'll play the butler
who doesn't show up.

I mean, we're not going, right?

both: No!

You know I can hear you?

Well, then you know
we're not going.

Max, Max, she's got spunk!

And she's only slightly drunk.

I haven't been slightly drunk
in five beers.

(cheering)

I think we got this.

Thanks for horribly
maiming Frank.

Two more pins
and we're going to Detroit.

(sighs)

Waiting for my ball to drop.

Story of my life.

This guy knows
what I'm talking about.

No, I don't.

Lemme get the ball for you, Max.

Look, like I said to you
at that all-you-can-eat

Indian buffet, unless you wanna
get bit, get out of the way.

And like I said to you
at the Indian buffet,

I just want to be part of this.

(crunching)
(screams)

Damn it, my fingies!

Max, I'm sorry!

-Caroline, what did you do?
-(groaning)

You're doing more damage
to the team

than when we tried
to get separate checks

at Macaroni Grill.

Hey, if I don't drink,
I don't pay.

Eh, this was
my pickle-snatching hand.

Like I said
at the Indian buffet,

I think we might
need an ambulance.

(yells)

Wow, that was the craziest
woman's room ever.

It was filled with
urinals and men.

Wait a minute.

Hey, did you get the stuffed
animal for Barbara yet?

No, but something more
impressive happened.

And we're still not sure how.

Like I said when I was
watching the OA,

what the hell am I looking at?

On the bright side, maybe she's
not as dumb as you thought.

That claw machine is harder to
get into than my neighbor Irene.

We looked away for two seconds.

Some 12-year-olds
were making fun of Han,

so we piled on.

We gotta get her out of there.

All right.
I'll keep her entertained

and you guys sneak up
behind her with the claw.

Max, so you don't think
it's broken, do you?

I know you've always
wanted a hook,

but I don't wanna be
the cause of it.

Is there any way
you can use your left?

Out of the question.
This one's just for show.

In an emergency,
someone else can bowl for Max,

but since we're mid-game,

it must be someone
of the same gender.

I was gonna see how this worked
out before I dropped it on you.

I'm also league commissioner.

I'm sure one of you
knows how to bowl.

Not to stereotype,
but look at you.

Bowling wives!
Bowling wives!

It's time to help
our bowling guys.

Think we should help her, hon?

That's right,
we're having an affair.

And no.

(sighs)

Yeah, they won't do it.

Is it too late
to put Earl in a wig?

Oh, that takes hours.

And I don't have the glue on me.

We're gonna have to forfeit.

I guess I Can't Believe
It's Not Gutter

is going to Detroit.

And I can't believe it.

No.
I can do the bowling.

I have to because I think I'm
years away from being on top.

I have vertigo.

You are amazing.

All you need is two pins.

And even if you don't get them,

I'll still love you.

But please get two pins.

Caroline, Caroline,
she's on her own.

If she doesn't get this,
she'll die alone.

Max, you know how much
I hate that cheer.

May I please have a practice
swoop on the court next door?

Everyone else
got practice swoops.

Does she think rolling the ball
down the lane

is called "swooping"?

I don't know.
She calls sheets "bedding."

Uh, gutter ball.
Someone's dying alone.

Oh, that was my bad.

I should have told you.
Aim away from the gutters.

The gutters are the things
on the sides.

Just--just focus on the center,

whip it back, and...

Or do that.

(shimmering tone)

(theme from Chariots of Fire)

*

(creaking)

(gasps)

(cheering)

Oh, my God!

The ten bases fell down!

I swooped them all!

That was incredible.

I hate to say it,
but I had this crazy thought

that you were trying
to sabotage the team

because you hate bowling.

I thought so, too!

There's someone down there.

Max?

You cheated!

You can't pin this on me.

How did Barbara get in
the claw machine?

Well, we've ruled out magic.

Currently, our top theory
is invisible gnomes.

Yeah, she may not be a genius,

but she goes after
what she wants.

Like Oleg at Swingers Yoga.

What you really had to see
was Sophie going in after her.

She was face down, Spanx up.

Man, it was wild.

All right, we better get going
before they realize

we broke their claw machine
and their sex booth

and two of the condom machines.

There's always next season.

We'll get back at it.
I can work on some cheers.

You are never coming here again.

-Thank you!
-(laughs)

Get a lane!

(sighs)
Take it easy, Larry.

Those are my handcuffs.

(sighs)
One day, I'll be able to

come to a bowling alley
without leaving like this.

(cash register dings)

Max, Caroline, I have announcement.

You're actually much shorter
and are walking on stilts?

I have made a special menu

for tomorrow's
Valentine's night dinner.

Han, that's so romantic.

Yeah, romantic and wrong.

This place isn't
When Harry met Sally.

It's "When Harry met Salmonella."

Max, Club Sandwich.

And heads up... I lost a band-aid.

Theme menu means
I can charge one bigger price,

like in top restaurants.

See?
"Prick fix."

Oh, Han, it's pronounced "prix fixe."

Have you seen our chef?

It's definitely "prick fix."

Tomorrow night,

Cupid will come
to Williamsburg diner.

Didn't have the heart
to tell him Cupid is dead.

Yep, hit by a mack truck

crossing
the Brooklyn-Queens expressway...

His fat, diapered baby ass

splattered all over the windshield.

I love Valentine's Day.

That's your reaction?
I killed Cupid.

You're either romantic or not.

I'm not even going to try
to convince you.

Oh, he's dead.
And the proof...

When's the last time you knew
anyone who fell in love?

Real love, like Ice Loves Coco.

How about them?

They've been holding hands and
romantic whispering all night.

Their romantic whispering
goes like this.

"I own nipple clamps."

Plink!
Cupid's not dead.

Plink!
There goes his little arrow.

Plink, plink!

Clamp, ouch!
Clamp, ouch!

Clamp, clamp!
Ouch, ouch!

{pub}Max, since it's just after midnight,

Well, judging from
that smile on your face,

I'd say it's a finger-sized hole
in your apron.

Candy hearts!
Here, hold out your hand.

Let's get our heart on.

I'm way ahead of you.

"Be mine"... classic.
What's yours say?

"Caroline Channing is lame.

"I hate you for giving me this.

Valentine's Day is the worst."

Ooh, cinnamon.
Mmm.

Good evening, Earl.

My, my, my, Sophie,

seeing you in that dress
makes my heart race.

Two scoops of ice cream
in a one scoop cone.

Oh, Earl, you make me smile.

I wish we had black people in
Poland when I was growing up.

Too bad.

We really would have enjoyed
segregation and Hitler.

Oh, hi, building neighbors.

Well, I was just driving by,
and since it was raining,

I thought I could offer you two girls

a ride home in my town car.

The last time
someone offered me a ride,

I ended up in
a drainage pipe in Jersey.

Sophia, you rent a town car?

Yes, but only when it's raining,

because, you know, I got hair
extensions and nail extensions,

and, you know, I...
I'm too extended to walk.

Hello.
I saw you from kitchen.

You turned pick-up window
into painting.

Plink!

Velvet painting of nude at counter.

Clamp, ouch!

The girls tell me
you own cleaning service.

I would like to hire you
to clean my house.

Oh, yeah, this is possible.

I will send girl.
What is your address?

I don't want some girl.

I want you to come clean.

Oh, you cannot get me to come.

Oh, I can get you to come.

No, I can no longer come anymore.

No, Max and Caroline can come.

No, no, we're not coming.

So no one can get you to come?

Well, some people
can get me to come...

Just not you.

Hard to get... I like it.

Go get the coats.
I'll get this check.

Here's the last check, Earl.

Oh, Max, can you take care
of that for me, please?

Sure. Why?

Uh, nothing pressing...
Just having a heart attack.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Wait, you're having a heart attack?

Most definitely.

I've had three in my life.
We're old friends.

Earl, you're having a heart attack.

I'll be fine.
Have you seen my tangerine?

I had a tangerine set aside
for my walk home.

Forget the tangerine.

Earl's having a heart attack!

Sophie, we're taking
the town car to the hospital.

Earl, when did the pain start?

When I saw Sophie in that dress.

Oh, hell, no!

Why is this line so long?
Did the new iPhone come out?

Let's just get him over there.

Max, anything you can do
to move this along?

Move!
Celebrity coming through.

Morgan Freeman having a heart attack.

He is having a heart attack.

On a scale of one to ten,
what's your pain?

Uh, two, we were
just in the neighborhood,

looking for a place to have jell-o.

I was talking to Morgan Freeman.

Take him now!

Sir, he has a history
of heart trouble.

All right, we'll get him in.

Earl, go with the nurse.

Damn, it's a man.

We'll be right out here, Earl.
Everything is gonna be okay.

Have a seat and wait.

Look at me, Gingerbread.
If anything happens to him,

I will staple your nut sack
to that chair.

{pub}That's right... it's me again.

For the tenth time, he's fine.

He had a minor attack,
but he's in good hands.

I would know... I had both
of my heart attacks here.

I want to go back there
and see for myself.

Family members only.

Well, I'm his daughter.

Oh, really? It says here
he's 75 years old...

Well, he started late.

And African-American.

He started late with a honky.
I'm one of those combo babies.

Here...

You need proof?

My last name is Black, see?
Max Black.

He's black.
I'm Black.

It'd be dumb if we weren't related.

Can I just get back
to playing Angry Birds?

You are yammering on here
about nothing

while the love of my life
is back there alone and scared.

You said he was your father.

Now he's the love of your life?

He's both.
We're from the South.

Have a seat.

I got us two lattes.
It took forever.

The guy in front of me
missed his kidney transplant

waiting for a mocha frappuccino.

- Any news?
- The same.

But they won't let me back there.
I even told him Earl was my father.

Now's my chance.
Nurse Chewbacca's on the move.

I'm going back there.

If you see anyone about
to notice me sneak by,

draw all the attention to yourself.

Max, I don't know if I can do that.

You're right.
That's kind of my thing.

- Okay, let me think.
- You don't have time to think.

Just throw the coffees
against the wall.

That's ridiculous.

I graduated top of my class
at Wharton.

I can do better than that.

Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender, please.

Oh, my God!

Those were not nonfat.

Earl!

- You in here?
- Max, is that you?

Ain't you sweet?

But you didn't have
to wait around for me.

This is Narcissus.

She's from the Fiji Islands

and gives one hell of a sponge bath.

Hi.
Can we have a minute alone?

Earl, do you think
this is a good time

to have a sponge bath...
I mean, in your condition?

Max, when they look like that,

there's never a bad time
for a sponge bath.

- So are you doing okay now?
- Pretty good.

The doctor said it was a mild one,

but I'm going to have
to stay here a couple nights.

Could you find out how much
extra for me to get my own room?

A private room?

The last time I was
in one of these places,

the guy in the bed next to me
thought he was a parrot

and asked me for crackers
the whole damn night.

Done. I'll get you your own room.

And don't worry about the expenses.

I got a little money
stashed away for a rainy day.

I am not using your money.

But let me guess,
"rainy day" is a strain of weed?

Now you're getting it.

I'll see you later.

Don't die, or I'll kill you.

So what, now you want a private room?

How's he going to pay for that?

Oh, so that old man has
to be the only man in America

who has to pay his medical bills?

Mr. Freeman's done
a lot of successful movies.

I don't think your sarcastic
attitude is very professional.

"Professional"?

Um, an hour ago,
your little thug friend here

threatened to cut me so deep,
I'd have a vagina.

That offer still stands.

She's upset.
And vagina's her go-to.

Well, the only reason
I haven't called security

is they were laid off two weeks ago.

What is your name?

Tig.

And it's fake,
so good luck with that.

Sir, you're representing

the Shecter family wing
of this hospital.

My family knows the Schecters.

In fact, their son David
interns here,

and if I made a call,
he would not be pleased.

If you know them,

why are we talking
to this lump behind a desk?

Suck it, red face!
We're going over your head!

How do you like me now, bitch?

Hey, get your phone.

See if he can swing Earl
a private room.

I think I still have his cell number.

We went out a few times
until I realized he was serious

about going down that pro Bono route.

- Did you two have sex?
- No.

Sweet, that's what you
can offer him for the room.

That's amazing.

Someone found a florist
that delivers after midnight.

That's not so amazing.

I know a guy
named "Sticky Icky" Ricky

who delivers
exclusively after midnight.

You know, I just realized
this is the first Valentine's Day

I won't get flowers from my father.

Aw, that's cute,
with a big old side of creepy.

No, it's sweet.

Every year
from the time I was a baby,

and even when I had boyfriends,

I'd get flowers from my father
with a card that says,

"You'll always be my Valentine."

I got a sweet Valentine from
a guy I liked in high school.

It said, "I'll give you
five bucks to lift your shirt."

Caroline...
Hey, I'll be right with you.

There he is.
Cuter than I remember.

Hey. Wow.

When I heard your voice mail,
I couldn't believe it.

Yes, well, I wasn't sure
you'd want to come down,

because...
you know...

You dumped me two years ago?

Well, "dumped" is a strong word.

Tore my heart out,
shook it in front of my face.

That any softer?

Hate to interrupt
the "perfect white teeth" convention,

but we're in a hurry.

David, this is my friend Max.

A friend of ours was admitted,

and we were hoping
to get him a private room.

Oh, so you're not here to return

my Dartmouth t-shirt
you stole from me.

You gave that to me.

No, I didn't!
I love that shirt.

I feel like I lost custody
of it in a divorce,

and now I'm like a deadbeat dad.

How about the room?
Any chance?

Please.
Pretty please.

Oh, well, since
you said "pretty please,"

I'll see what I can do.

We should be clear.
We can't pay.

We're broke...
both of us.

But I'm sure
you heard that somewhere.

Yeah...

Everywhere.

David, I hope your family
didn't lose any money

with my father.
Did they?

Nope, still filthy rich.

And I can do my best to burn
some filthy off that rich,

by getting your friend a V.I.P. room.

I'll just drop some names.

By that, I mean my own.

Shouldn't be a problem.

I love Jews.

Yeah, we're generous.
Spread the word.

Uh, if you wouldn't mind
giving Narcissus my whereabouts?

Did you see the look on
that desk lump's big, red face

when I pushed you by him?

I did, but I think
throwing him the finger

was a tad out of line.

Wow, Dr. David really hooked us up.

Yeah, this is like an episode
I.C.U. Edition.

So, Earl, what do you think?

Good lord, is that a Matisse?

- I believe so.
- Then, mama, I'm home.

{pub}Here, ladies, put
these suckers in your station.

I think I might get
a late Valentine dinner crowd.

You also think you might
get a late growth spurt,

but that's not happening either.

At best,
you'll get three single girls

waddling over at midnight
to cry into some tapioca.

True.
I need to cut the crap.

Valentine's dinner is bust.

And look, I have sacrificed
my manhood for no cash value.

But your wings are adorable.

Yes, but matching panties
are suffocating the boys.

Come on, close early.

We've only got
one table of twi-hards.

I want to go see Earl.

Oh, what the hell?
I love my man Earl, too.

So screw it.
Let's fly over there.

Ooh, this isn't like
the hospitals in Poland.

The lights are working.

Okay, sit down.
I'll take you in one at a time.

All right, Cupid, you're first.

Oh, don't wake him.
Go back out.

Angels.
Oh, lord, no.

Thank God it's you, Han.

I saw the wings,
and I thought heaven was filled

with chunky Chinese cherubs
and no jazz.

Oh, okay, great.
I'll see you in five.

I'm gonna go meet Dr. David.

Oh, wait a second.

If you're going to go meet man,
you need lip gloss.

Oh, thanks, Sophie.

Oh, no, no, no, no.
Okay.

I have Valentine gift
I want to give you.

Oh, hepatitis "C"?

Happy Valentine's Day.

Look at me.
Now look at you.

Now look at me again.

Does this look right to you?

Hard to get... I like it.

Oh, hey.
So how's your friend doing?

Good.
And thanks for that V.I.P. room.

He feels like a million bucks,
which I'm sure is what it costs,

so I brought you
a little thank-you gift.

That is not my Dartmouth shirt.

No, that's held hostage
at the townhouse.

This says Williamsburg.
That's where I live now.

No way.
That's where I live.

Yeah, I moved there
just to piss my father off,

but I wound up loving it.

I wound up loving it, too.

Hey, maybe we could see
each other there sometime...

You know, go out?

Yeah, I don't think so.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what?

Look, Caroline,
it's been really great

getting to reconnect with you, but...

I don't see this happening again.

Oh.

I mean, it's my parents.

With your father in prison,
the whole scandal,

I could never bring you home.

Not even just
to piss off your father?

I mean, me dating Caroline Channing...
What would people think?

I hope you understand.
Oh, hey, thanks for the tee.

Nice of everyone to stop by.

Didn't see Caroline.
She busy tonight?

Oh, no, she's here.

She's out there running around,
trying to swing a boyfriend situation

with her doctor friend
who got us the V.I.P. hook-up.

What about you, Max?

No sweetheart on Valentine's Day.

I worry about you.

Be nice if you had someone special.

I already do.

Ah, Max, I'm only going to be
around another 30 or 40 years.

You better widen the net a bit.

Visiting hours are up.
Friends have to leave.

She can stay, nurse.
She's family.

Earl, I'm family?

Yes, and the best kind of family.
You don't want my money.

Hey, Earl.
You look really good.

So did you and Dr. Dave
do it in a hospital closet?

All very "Grey's Monotony"?

No, that won't be happening.

I asked him out and
he said he could never date me,

because of my father
and "what would people think?"

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what?

I feel like I was just hit

by the same mack truck
that killed Cupid.

Well, somebody's about
to get hit by a truck...

A Max truck.

Hey, you, Dr. I-Forget-Your-Name.

How?
It's written on every wall.

Okay, Dr. Exit.

What is wrong with you?
Doctors are supposed to be sensitive.

I mean, it's Valentine's Day,
and she has nothing.

Couldn't you be like
every other guy on the planet

and just lead her on
and not call her the next day?

That is the decent thing to do.

And for the record, she is
so hopped up on candy hearts,

you would have gotten some
tonight, fo' sho!

You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

Well, I guess nobody knows me
better than you,

girl I've never met before.

And now I would like to speak
to the pro Bono part of you,

who understands
that nothing I just said

should affect that man
in the V.I.P. room.

That was actually
a very cool thing to do.

Earl is fine.
Don't worry.

And as far as Caroline goes,
I'm sorry, but...

Her father hurt a lot of people.

Whatever you put out there
comes back to you.

Ugh.

What now... you gonna threaten
to feed me my nipples again?

No.

Actually, someone just said something

about the things
you do coming back to you,

and I decided the smart move
was to apologize.

Thanks, but it's not necessary.

Actually, you're the nicest
person I've dealt with tonight.

Ugh.
Rough job, dude.

Here, Happy Valentine's Day.

You want to go out sometime?

Why would...

Yeah, give me your number.
I'll call you tomorrow.

Sleeping in
that hospital chair all night

wasn't that uncomfortable.

No, the chairs weren't.

Your sad Valentine whimpering was.

- So how you feeling this morning?
- Pretty good,

considering I survived
the very first Valentine's Day

I didn't get flowers from my father.

Ugh.

So you got one year under your belt.

Don't get so cocky.

You still have
to make 23 more to tie me.

You know, all this time,
I've been feeling sorry for you

'cause you didn't know your father,

but after seeing
how you took care of Earl...

I feel sorry for your father
that he didn't know you.

You would have been
a wonderful daughter.

Don't hold that thought.

I don't want to cry till after
we break open the tapioca.

No, I didn't just win
a beauty contest.

No, these were left
on the front doorstep.

They're both addressed to Caroline.

- Sorry, Max.
- Oh, no, that's cool.

Wouldn't want to break
my winning streak.

Oh, well, just look at it this way.

She got the flowers.
You got the knockers.

All right, girls,

well, I'm off to buy scratchers

before all
the Puerto Ricans get them.

"You'll always be my Valentine.

Love, Daddy."

Aw.

The other one from Dr. Dave?

Change his mind
after I tore him a new one?

It's from my father as well,
but it's written to you.

"Thank you for taking such
good care of my sweetheart.

M. Channing."

That is so sweet.

Roses from a man.

Now I'm starting to get it.

Is it weird that I kind of want
to have sex with your dad?

Plink!

People, I have huge news!

Who's carrying the rest of it in?

I found a way to improve diner business,

and the crazy part is I
don't have to fire you two.

Are you gonna clean that dead body smell

out of the ladies' room?

No, that's what plug-in Glade is for.

Okay, remember how that
ice bucket challenge

caught on with celebrities?

Han, people did those challenges for ALS,

not to get publicity for
a diner that Yelp calls,

"A bit of a dice roll."

Well, I've invented
the condiment challenge.

Why, 'cause condoms are a challenge

to you and other virgins?

Earl, you're on fire!

I'm gonna down ketchup and mustard

and then nominate Mr. George Clooney.

If you really want this thing to go viral,

I happen to know that Clooney
likes him some spicy sriracha.

All I know is that anal is hot.

His wife's name is Amal, not anal.

I still stand by my statement.

Action!

Otherwise known as,
"Let's get this over with."

Mr. George...

Uh-oh! I... hot!

Too hot!

I actually think that could go viral.

Damn! I hit the wrong thing.

Han! Han, do over!

My insides are on fire!

I love Wednesdays.

I get to erase all the genitalia

that was drawn on the cupcake board.

And I love Thursdays
'cause I get to redraw them.

I need some more paper towels.

Oh, I think they're downstairs.

Max, you do fake stairs so well.

I know.

It's the second best thing I fake.

Hey, isn't that Andy?

My Andy?

Oh, God, it is Candy Andy.

He's coming over here.

Hey, Max. Wow.

Your chalkboard has really nice legs.

Hi.

- Hey.
- I know, so silly.

It's just I'm not very
good at seeing my exes.

Yeah, or hiding.

How's the candy business?

Sour? Nutty? Full of Nerds?

It's great. Candy's not going anywhere,

like my grandma's knee fat.

So you guys still over at the diner?

We aren't still at the diner.

This is our cupcake window.

Uh, hello?

Your shift at the diner
started five minutes ago!

Okay, we're still at the diner too.

We're here, we're there, we're all over.

Like herpes?

- Nice.
- Yeah.

So what brings you over here

besides obviously stalking
your ex-girlfriend?

Actually, I'm looking for a flower shop.

Oh, flowers for a girl you never got over?

Uh, no, for my fiancée.

Did he just say Beyoncé?

Actually, I'm getting married.

Coo.

Caroline, I'm sorry.

I was gonna call you and tell you,

but then I felt like
maybe you wouldn't care.

You know, I mean, it's been a long time.

I hope you're not hurt.

Hurt? I'm hurt.

Hurt that you didn't ask me
and Max to do your wedding cake!

Oh, God. I'll be downstairs.

Well, yeah.

Actually, Romy and I haven't
decided on a cake yet.

You know, she's pretty busy.
She runs her own business.

Ohh! Oh!

"The Business Bride."

Wasn't that Katherine Heigl's last movie?

The one that brought her back to TV?

Max, can you please come back upstairs?

I'm waiting for the elevator!

Is that Candy Andy?

Well, well.

You two getting back together again?

- Oh, I'm getting married.
- To someone else.

Oh, Lord, this is why I
don't like to be outside.

Well, I gotta run.

Not really. I'll be walking away.

But if you're serious about the cake...

So serious.

Major ser-i-osity!

In fact, it's our wedding gift to you.

- Oh, God.
- Max, stop.

There is no downstairs.

Yeah, it's not possible
to get any lower than this.

Okay, well...

how about I text you after I talk to Romy?

It was great seeing you, Caroline.

You too, Max.

You guys are gonna watch my
butt as I walk away, right?

You gonna make it clap for daddy?

I cannot make it clap, but
I can make it go, "Whoo!"

Um, couple things.

One, he's still hot.

And two, are you insane?

You want us to do your
ex-boyfriend's wedding cake?

Max, I broke up with him. Remember?

I'm a mature, evolved, sophisticated,

sexy but not in your face about it woman.

I can handle this.

I think it's a bad idea.

And I know bad ideas. I was one.

I...

broke up... with him.

Dramatic... talking...

is... annoying.

How's it going there, hot stuff?

Is your tongue working?

I'm gonna think of
another video to go viral

to set this place on fire, and if not,

I'll eventually have to
set this place on fire.

Either way, I'm not giving up.

You tell your clothes that?
'Cause they didn't get the memo.

Get this. Andy says that he and Romy

would love to meet us to
talk about wedding cakes

at their loft in Manhattan.

Queen Romy has summoned us

to a cake tasting at their loft!

Uh, can I borrow your phone for a sec?

There. I deleted his text.

I deleted his number.

I also deleted my number.

We aren't doing this.
You are not that cool.

Everyone knows that.

You're not. Cool girls don't freak out

when you cop a feel in the freezer.

Oh! Oh!

You know his number by heart.

This has nothing to do with my heart.

It's business. I broke up with him.

It's like you don't know
that I broke up with him.

I broke up with him. Didn't
know if you caught that

'cause my back was to you.

Hey, everybody!

Good news!

My baby was delivered today.

Oh, my God!

Did I black out for nine months again?

The baby didn't come out of my box, Earl.

It came out of this one.

Wow, you can really get anything on Amazon.

It's called a "Maybe Baby."

While Oleg and I are
trying to get pregnant,

we're gonna use it to
practice for the real thing.

So you're having a key-section?

Strangely, this is not the weirdest birth

we've seen at the diner.

Do you like him?

Weren't you the baby in "American Sniper"?

Yeah, it's got a computer
inside to keep track

of our parenting skills.

And if we get a score of over 92,

we get 20% at Papa John's.

Any Papa John's!

Well, you're having a fake
baby for all the right reasons.

The baby's here?

Aww, you're a father. Think fast!

Aww!

Our first father-son catch.

Let's get to know each other... "Bob"?

All they had left were the white babies.

The single actresses over 40
snap up all the minorities.

Hey, Max.

Could you maybe babysit
my Maybe Baby tomorrow?

You know, 'cause I-I
really need some me time.

Fine. 20 bucks an hour.

Extra in case he orders some adult movies

I've been wanting to see.

Okay, Max, wash your fancy sweatpants.

We are confirmed for Andy and Romy's

wedding cake tasting for tomorrow.

Andy? You mean that cute guy

that you ruined your relationship with?

Sophie, it wasn't the right relationship.

He didn't support my career.

The cupcake thing?

Pickup!

Like father like son.

Thank you guys so much for coming.

These cakes look so lovely.

They are.

Really nice place you got here.

I noticed there was a door on the bathroom.

I don't want to brag, but check
out all the outlets we got.

Lot of power. Two-prong, three-prong.

You got one of those weird European plugs?

Bring it.

How funny is he?

Oh, the funniest.

Oh, God.

So, Romy, it looks like you travel a lot.

I love all your...

Objet d'art.

Oh, God.

I'm a hat designer, so I go to Malaysia

and Sri Lanka a lot for materials.

I'm poor, so I go to
McDonald's and Taco Bell a lot

for my meals.

Oh, show 'em one of your hats, Romes.

The purple one Pippa Middleton
wore in "Star" magazine.

Oh! Pippa Middleton, wow.

She was up for a job on "The Today Show,"

but she didn't get it.

Andy, they don't want to see my hats.

Oh, Andy wants us to see your hats.

Let's see your hats.

Oh, this guy was there
when no one believed in me,

and he supported me in every way,

and now I'm in over a hundred
department stores worldwide.

Worldwide?

That is wide.

You know the tasting is for them, right?

Come on, let 'em see what you do.

Sorry, I'm a proud fiancé.

It's a little unmanly, but it's m'thing.

Ooh, I'll go get Black Dahlia.

Max will like that one.

Oh!

You okay?

Absolutely.

We didn't work out,
you found someone great,

supported her business, and
now you're getting married.

Pretty sure he meant, "Are you choking?"

Yup, that's where I was headed.

Caroline, you broke up with me.

She broke up with you?

I hadn't heard that.

See? All bitter... better.

Max, do you want to try it on?

Ahem, she doesn't need a hat.

Romes said I could have the sweet hat!

Oh, it looks adorable on
her. You should have it.

What is this, a hat tasting now?

Well, it's not a cupcake tasting anymore

'cause you ate them all.

You guys are hilarious. I
don't need to taste those.

You and Max are a part of Andy's past,

and I would honored if you'd do our cake

and come to the wedding as our guests.

Oh, that is a great idea.
Hey, there will be a lot

of self-destructive man-children there.

Max, feels like your kind of party.

And it's on this awesome yacht.

You know, technically it's not a yacht

unless it's over 40 feet.

Is it? Okay.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Gah! I don't know.

And I'm not really into fun.

You know, I've had fun
and it's not that fun.

Got it. What was I thinking?

Be weird for you, Caroline, right?

Weird?

Weird if we didn't come!

Oh, God.

Look at this, Max.

Cupcakes and candy.

This could have been me and Andy's cake.

Our perfect cake for our perfect marriage.

No marriage is perfect...
except Ice-T and Coco.

Now, he's not perfect.

You broke up with him for a reason.

Andy's out there now. Come here.

Music at a wedding? How original.

Oh, there he is.

He looks so handsome in a tuxedo.

Calm down. So does Jane Lynch.

He's not perfect. Look, there.

He's going in for a nose pick.

No, just a scratch.

He has such nice hands. Big hands.

And there's gonna be a ring on it soon.

He's looking over here! Oh, oh!

- He can't see me cry!
- Okay, come on.

Think of something bad about him.

Think, think, think, think, think.

Uh... he always took too
long to finish during sex!

Oh, wait. That's a good thing.

It is? All right, come on.

There had to be something terribly wrong

with that relationship.

There was. That I ended it.

I kicked the perfect guy
for me out of my life.

Yup, here come the tears.

And here comes Andy!

Uh, do you have a bathroom? Oh!

Hey! Thought I saw you
guys peeking out of here.

So you guys act weird everywhere?

Yup, that's our signature.

Got us bounced out of Six Flags.

Where's Caroline?

The pretty ladies' room.

Hmm.

So it looks like you're getting married

to Not Caroline.

How's she doing?

I'm getting the feeling
this has been hard for her.

Temperature check.

Okay, I don't understand.

Are you asking me to bend over?

What if Caroline thought
she might have made a mistake

by breaking up with you?
Would you consider being

a runaway groom and giving
it another shot with her?

Just a thought.

Well, I guess I'd have
to say it's too late.

I'm getting married to Romy. I love her.

So that's a firm no?

Uh, Max.

All yours now.

How about we pretend
like none of this happened

and you guys come watch
me get married, okay?

Andy, wait.

I'm sorry.

I really am happy for you.

Go live your life. I wish you well.

Thank you. That means a lot to me.

Um...

I really did love you.

I know.

Even though you broke up with me.

Yeah, even though I broke up with you.

I did it. I didn't cry.

Max, what's wrong?

You could have had it all!

Max, I've never seen you cry.

I'm sorry, but maybe
he was the perfect guy!

And he loved you! You heard him!

Max, it's okay. Nobody gets it all.

Max, turn around and look at me.

No, I don't want you to see me cry.

Max, turn around.

This hat doesn't even work!

Oh, hey, I was just
looking for the bathroom.

I wanted to get stoned
before Andy got hitched.

You got some love for
me and my friend here?

- We need it.
- Whoa.

They put candy on Andy's wedding cake?

Brutal, dude.

Why is it brutal, dude?

'Cause of the bald spot
where I ate the gumdrops?

No, I mean with Andy's
business in the toilet.

Andy's business is in the toilet?

Yeah, he had to close
it down, but it's cool.

Romy's, like, loaded now.

I can't believe Andy didn't tell me

his business was in the toilet.

Oh, bummer.

Looks like I gotta do
this wedding thing sobes.

As long as it's not me, right?

That stoner, who I can easily see

having very sloppy sex with later,

just saved the day 'cause
now we know Andy lied to you.

And I wouldn't want to be with
someone who can't be honest.

See? He is so not perfect.

You so would not have had it all.

- Caroline.
- Andy?

I'm kind of in a hurry but I
think you should know something.

I lost my business.

I didn't want to tell you
because I was too proud.

I wanted you to think my life
was perfect, and it's not.

I mean, it's great, but it's not perfect.

Okay, I gotta go get
married. See you out there.

All right, so he's perfect.

I guess I'm not taking this dress back

'cause we're swimming home.

We're not swimming.

We're gonna take the "I hate my life" boat.

Um, big news.

Andy and Romy are in
Mexico for their honeymoon.

Weather forecast?

Cloudy with a chance of diarrhea.

Um, can I borrow that for a sec?

Oh, you're on her Instagram.

Cute. Good-bye.

You unfollowed her?

Now it's gonna look like I'm jealous

and can't handle their happiness.

Ya can't!

Hey, everybody! Look!

I got our report card back
from the Maybe Baby people!

We passed the test!

We're gonna be solid "C" parents!

Well, that's a better
grade than the diner got.

I'm gonna miss that little guy.

What I'm not gonna miss is fighting it

to get to Sophie's boob.

Okay, people.

Are you leaving?

I hope it was something I said.

Well, I have a video
that is sure to go viral.

I'm gonna stuff myself in this suitcase

for the Williamsburg Diner challenge.

Caroline, you film it this time.

Max, you zip me up.

And I thought I'd be the
first one to die here.

I, Han Lee, nominate Mr. George Clooney

to the Williamsburg Diner challenge

of packing yourself in a suitcase.

I'm also a fan of "The
Men Who Stare At Goats."

Let 'er zip, Max!

Han... consider this my birthday present.

I got my Papa John's gift certificate.

Mama Sophie wants to
buy pizza for everyone!

Well, now is as good a time as any.

Hello?

Are you filming? Hello?

Don't tell George Clooney!

Anyone? Are you filming?

I called this staff meeting
because lately,

I've noticed our diner family
is drifting apart.

Good work, everybody.
Good work.

Yeah!

Let's start off this powwow

by sharing our highs
and lows of the week.

My high was getting a particularly
interesting snapple fact.

And my low was...

Your entire body?

I'll go.
My high was finding a barrette

in the bathroom, and my low

was imagining my new life without it.

Max, your high?

I certainly am.

And my low will be when it wears off.

Well, my high was catching a glimpse

of a customer's lacy g-string,

and my low was seeing his junk.

My low is this meeting.

And my high is when it wraps up.

Can everybody take this serious...

I have a new low.

I have a new high.

Me too.

Everybody, please.

Han just clearly injured his vagina.

Synced and corrected by backinblack


That's not my phone.

My ringtone is Let It Go,
and you know that

'cause you threaten
to beat me every time it rings.

Well, it's not mine.

I keep my phone on vibrate

out of respect for those around me,

and also for little orgasms.

Max, it's the landline.

Oh, God!

Why is it ringing?

You said that phone only rings

if we're in trouble or if it's you

calling from the future
to tell us we're in trouble.

Ruh-roh.

That's gotta be the landlord.
The lease is up.

Fine, we'll just renew it,
even though I thought

they would have condemned
this place by now.

I mean, I did find a used condom
in the hallway yesterday.

- Hello?
- No!

Hang up.
We're not on the lease.

Good cover.
Now we just have to hope

the original tenant is a Benihana chef.

Okay.

We don't have much time.
Quick!

Grab two things you love.

I-I love nothing in here!

And why are we even
trying to keep an apartment

that has grass growing in the bathroom?

I love our toilet lawn.

It's gross.

Max, look at this place.

Our refrigerator door is
held on by scotch tape,

And, I mean, there is
black mold in there.

At least the black mold
made the other mold

move out of the neighborhood.

Come on!

Someone from the real estate company

is probably on their
way over to make sure

the original tenant still lives here.

All right, let's ride!

I know a guy that can drop off
some fake passports

for us in an airport locker.

Well, you know him too.
It's Oleg.

Hey!

Pick up that phone already!

Sounds like a damn PBS fund-raiser
down here.

Sophie, it's the landlord calling.

I just found out we've been
subletting illegally.

Oh, well, I always
wondered how you girls

could afford to live in this building.

And I ruled out prostitution
once I saw Caroline dance.

Good news.

I dug around the apartment

and I found the original lease.

Also found a copy of
my birth certificate.

Turns out my father's name
is "mother has no idea".

Forget that lease.

I've already found a new place for us.

A two-bedroom for $1,300 in Manhattan.

Oh... Manhattan, Kansas.

We can't afford to lose this lease.

As soon as they find
out this Lester Donovan

is no longer living there,
the rent will get higher

than Justin Bieber
on a plane with his dad.

So I tracked down this
original tenant guy, Lester.

He's still alive.

Ugh! Can't catch a break.

He's at a rest home in Sheepshead Bay.

We just have to go there and kidnap him.

We'll tie some cream of wheat
to a pole and lure him out.

First of all, in what world

do we have cream of wheat pole money?

And secondly, I am not gonna
go shake down some old man.

You won't have to.

He's probably already shaking.

If you're looking, I know a place.

You share a twin bed
with two other girls.

Oh, and there are cameras.

But you're paid $4.99 a minute

and get to meet
all the singles in your area.

Are you one of the singles in the area?

Technically I'd be your co-star.

Like it or not, we have
to hold on to our apartment.

Max is right. There are
two things in life you cannot lose.

A rent-controlled apartment
and bladder control.

Actually, there's
an apartment in my building

that just became available.

Stop by tomorrow.
You can see it.

This place is $1,200?

$1,250. It just went up
since we been talking.

We can't fit in here.

I'm not talking about me and you.

I'm talking about me and my boobs.

Nice retirement home.

Why don't we just live here?

Bingo tournaments,
unlimited hard candy,

and you get to crap your pants!

Lester?

That must be him.

I don't know who I am anymore,
but that must be him.

Hi, Mr. Donovan.

Lester?

Max, is he dead?

No, he's alive, but just...

This is so sad.

Look at how we treat our elderly.

Wake up!

I-I-I need you to wake up for this!

We are currently subletting
your old apartment,

and we need you to pretend

you still live there for a day.

Or just to pretend you still live.

Ladies, you're wasting your time.

He can't speak,
and he doesn't like girls.

He's a vegetable and a fruit.

Lester Donovan.

Oh, you're Lester!
Oh, thank God.

Listen, Lester, we need you...

I know, I know.
You want me to pretend

I still live in your apartment.
I overheard everything.

We're not all comatose, darling.

But I'm afraid... ahem...
it's not gonna happen, girls.

'cause I got a big week.

My special lady is moving in with me.

Heh heh.
'Cause this guy's

not gonna be around much longer.

18 hours tops!

Oh! Here's my princess.

Olivia!

Oh...

He's still with us.

God bless.

So we'll have to push
the move to Monday.

Yeah... About that, Lester.

I'm not ready to move in with you.

Olivia, wh... what do you mean?

Max, we should go. No way!
This is like watching

an elder version of The Bachelor!

Literally, the final rose!

Lester, it's not you.
It's me.

That's still in play at their age?

I'm just not ready to settle down.

Too many other fish in the sea.

I know, it's about that
new kid on the block,

Morty what's-his-name.
It's about Morty, isn't it?

Lester, please.

I don't want it to be weird

when we see each other at Bingo.

You should know this about Morty...

He's not a real man like me.

His middle name is Viagra!

Olivia!

Well, there's no point
hanging around here.

I'll just grab my penis pump,
and we're outta here.

Why is he gonna need that?

Here we are, "home, sweet
at least it's not a rest home".

Lester, not that I minded
pushing you 35 blocks, but...

You could walk at the home.

Why can't you walk now?

I'm too depressed to walk.

I've been depressed
since I learned to walk.

I mean, I was nine.
It was time.

I have just lost the love of my life!

Have you ever made love
to a lady with no teeth

and two plastic hips?

I, for one, have not.

Max?

No. But it just rocketed
to number one on my bucket list.

I lived here from 1954 to Studio 54.

Liza Minnelli threw up in that corner.

The only time I ever saw anybody

take three bows after a vomit.

Why did you leave?

You always think you're
gonna find something better.

Yep. The toilet grass is always greener.

Okay. That's the building rep, Lester.

Do we need to go over
our cover story again?

It's pretty easy.

I'm Carlotta Spaghetta...

Mild-mannered pet trainer by day,

hot-tempered Nigerian spy by night.

Lester, only listen to me.

Max is your granddaughter,

and I'm her sober companion...

Which is the only part
of our story that's true.

That's him. Now, just
sit and smile and nod.

I'll nod, but I'm not gonna smile.

Welcome to my grandfather's

happy, happy home.
There's his couch.

There's his kitchen.

What's this?

There's his bong.

His bong.

- Glaucoma.
- Chemo.

Well, good afternoon.

I'm Roger from building management.

I'm here to verify this lease,

and I'd like to do it before the rest
of this doorway caves in.

And of course you know
my dear, dear grandfather Lester.

I just have a few
questions, mr. Donovan.

Have you ever made love to a woman

with a silicone hip?

Amazing!

Okay! I can cross that one off my list.

Hey, girls.

I came through the back

'cause this junkie's on the front stoop,

and it's still a little awkward
between us.

Oh, uh, this is Sophie.
She lives upstairs.

As you can see, Roger, no problems.

Everything's totally legit.

Hey, who's the old guy?

She lives upstairs,
and she doesn't know Lester?

She knows him. This is
just a sexual game they play

called "who are you?"

That doesn't sound like a sexual game.

It is when she's saying it to his penis.

Sophie, this is the guy from the agency

who just came by to verify

that Lester actually lives here.

Oh, yeah!

He lives here every day!

Yeah, and we play that game forever.

Who are you?

Come closer.
He can't hear you.

I'm feeling better already.

So the main takeaway here

is that they both live
in the building legally.

Now, let's just sign that lease.

All right, Mr. Donovan,
I just need your signature here,

and this'll lock you into
the lease for another four years.

What's your hip situation?

Oh, I'm as hip as they come, baby! Yeah!

Now, that's a looker!

- Here ya go.
- Yep! All done.

You have the apartment
for another four years.

Enjoy it?

Oh, and I'm required to say:
Traces of cancerous stuff

have been found
in some of the apartments.

Have a nice day!

Four more years!
Four more years!

We get to stay in the place

I never thought I'd want to stay in.

Oh, lester, you're up.
Feeling better?

Like a million bucks.

I feel like my old self again.

Oh, hey, it's been 18 hours.

Let's go see if your friend's dead.

Yeah, Lester.
Let's get ya home.

What are you talking about?
I am home.

What do you mean?
This is our place.

Not according to that lease
I just signed.

I'll be in my bedroom.

Good to be home!

- Ruh-roh.
- Ruh-roh.

Ladies, this is delicious!

You know, at the home
they keep salt on lockdown.

Salt and the dementia patients.

Well, it doesn't look like
bad grandpa's leaving tonight.

Maybe I can help.

I can put some ground glass
in his Salisbury steak.

It's called a Ukrainian divorce.

Eh... I'll try this jell-o first.

Yeah, it's so old, it might kill him.

Lester, I brought you some jell-o.

- Would you like some?
- That's very nice of you,

but I'm not going anywhere.

Lester, really, you don't
want to live with us.

Caroline sings so much

she should have animated birds on her.

Look, there's no way I'm going
back to that retirement home.

I feel alive for the first time since...

Since I died briefly last year.

Oh, my God, really?

Yes, some nurse tripped
over the power cord.

A-and besides, it's really
helping me get over Olivia.

I'm finally realizing there are
plenty of other fish in the sea.

Hey, everybody!

And there's one of 'em.

She puts the "ass" in "bass."

Friend, I'll be in my booth.

Hey, Sophie.
You remember Lester.

Lester, you remember
when they discovered fire.

Please, please, join me.

May I buy you an egg cream?

Oh, I do love an egg cream.

Oh, excuse me, I gotta
go powder by nose.

Girls...

Girls, I know you want
your apartment back

and I'm a reasonable man,

so all I want before I go
is a little you-know-what.

More jell-o?

I'm talking about sex.
Rebound sex!

Rebound sex?

Are you sure you'll even be
able to rebound from having sex?

Are you kidding?

There's nothing but sex
at that retirement home.

Why do you think I put myself there?

It's wall-to-wall whoopee,

and you don't even have
to drive home after.

Now, I have in mind
a certain elegant lady.

Ahh, you're out of T.P.!

You can set me up
for one night with your friend,

and I will gladly leave the apartment.

I'll be in your booth.

Hey, Sophie, you'll get
with that old guy, right?

Are you fricking kidding me?

Lester, she didn't go for it.

I'm not going back
to that retirement home

with my tail between my legs.

I gotta sleep with someone
to make Olivia jealous.

There's a new thing that
kids are doing called "lying."

Why don't you just make something up?

Pics or it didn't happen.

I need a selfie
with whoever I hook up with

for my Facebook page.

And if it's not gonna be Sophie,

My guess, it's gonna be
one of you two up in bed...

Slugger.

Slugger.

♪ Take me out to the ball game ♪

♪ Take me out... ♪

Now I know why Liza threw up.

Now I'm depressed.

So you lost the straw pull

for who's gonna sleep with Lester.

Look, you've been saying
you wanted to have sex

and you've also been saying
you wanna go antiquing.

So, behind that door are both.

And, Max, I think you
cheated in that straw pull.

Of course I cheated!

Look, I have had a lot of crazy sex.

I once did it with a clown at a funeral.

But I cannot see that penis pump.

I won't be able to come back from that.

You think I can?

I do, I think the science part
of your brain would enjoy it.

Ladies, I've stretched.

I'm ready.

Fine, I'll take the bullet.

I don't think there are
any bullets in that gun.

Are you sure?

'Cause I don't wanna have an old baby.

This is ridiculous

that we're even entertaining the thought

of doing anything with an
old man that isn't a Trump.

Max, I can't do this.

One of us will just have to take

that apartment in Earl's building

and you will find another place.

But then we'd have to live apart.

I know, but I don't see another choice.

I'm not ready to live without you.

I'm not ready to live without you.

What?

I saw the pump!
Pack your things!

Max, I can't believe you were
almost willing to do that

to live with me.

You know what, I'm going in.

Because the thought of not seeing you

24 hours a day, 7 days
a week, would kill me!

We'll meet
every Saturday morning for coffee.

Less and less over time, of course.

That was a good start.
What else you got?

- Nothing!
- Nothing!

Ah, I'm really liking
this whole back door thing.

Wow, that's the first time
I've ever said that.

Don't get used to it, Sophie.

You never do.

No, I mean, we're gonna
have to leave this place.

We couldn't do it with Lester.

I know, that's why I'm here.

You don't have to do this for us.

If you two didn't live in this building,

then we'd drift apart

and we'd only see each other
on saturdays for coffee.

Well... I'd probably only go once.

Look, just give me 90 seconds.

I mean, he's got a pump.
How hard could it be?

She's amazing.

We should probably
get her something for this.

What would be appropriate?

That good candle under the sink?

We've only used it once.

That seems right.

I don't know what that was,
but I'm not up to it.

I-I don't think my heart could take it.

Afraid sex with Sophie would kill you?

Yeah, that's why I haven't gone there.

You know, I was all excited
about... about all the...

all the other fish in the sea.

That was a great white shark!

Hey, come on!

I just stretched.
I'm ready.

Look, uh, could we get a quick pic?

I might've gone there, too,
if I knew he had an iPhone 5s.

Try to be as sexy as possible.
Oh, okay, yeah.

When Olivia sees that,
she's gonna say, "Morty who?"

Girls, enjoy your apartment.

I had some lovely times here.

Thank you so much, Lester.
Bye, grandpa.

Maybe sometime we could
come visit you in the home.

Email me. We'll talk.

That's still in play at his age?

Hey, thanks for the blue balls, Lester!

Nighty-night, girls.

Max, we get to stay together!

And even better,

he left his wheelchair!

Push me into the kitchen,
I wanna crack open a beer.

I wonder if I'll be pushing
you like this when you're 70.

You'll be pushing me
like this when I'm 30.

There's no place like home.

I'll go get the scotch tape.

Synced and corrected by backinblack


Here you go.

And I hope you enjoyed
dinner and the show.

The show being me pretending
I'm happy as a waitress.

Caroline, where is Max?

And I've already checked
the bowels of hell.

Yeah, I know where I work.

Max is going to be late today

'cause she got stuck
on the subway.

But you said yesterday
she was late

because she was stuck
on the subway.

No, I believe I said yesterday
she got stuck under the subway.

Oleg, a little help.

Oh, Max?

Today she got stuck on a bus.

And you said that the day before
yesterday.

- Earl?
- She got stuck between the moon

and New York City.

I know it's crazy,
but it's true.

Sorry I'm late.

I couldn't find our cat, Nancy.

Also, I was stuck
on the bus or under the subway.

Unless they told you
something different,

then I was doing that.

Oh, come on.
That excuse was less satisfying

than the end of Serial.

Max, really,
what do you take me for?

Well, I know where
I can't take you.

On the big rides
at Disneyland.

Nancy still hasn't come home.

I'm freaking out.

She's the only thing I love.

[gasps]

Whatever.

I had a cat once.
He was cool.

He was black
and very sexually active.

Oh, wait, the cool cat
I'm talking about was me.

Earl, be careful, at your age,
you could die having sex.

I know.

Those ladies don't know
whether I'm coming or going.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

I think Nancy might be gone
for good.

I just can't believe
she didn't take me with her.

We had a deal.

Max, she'll come back
to the apartment,

even if she doesn't want to.

I mean, I always do.

I am not surprised
you're not worried.

You never really liked Nancy.

You call her "that cat."

As in, "that cat"
peed on my pillow.

While I was sleeping
on it, Max.

Well, blame me.
I got her drunk.

Hey, everybody!

Look, girls,
I got your pussy in my purse.

Either that's a cat, or
you two got to keep better track

of your belongings.

Yay!

That cat's back.

See, Max?

I am excited.

[baby talk]
Oh, I missed you so much.

Oh, yes, I did.

That's not Nancy.

That is a boy.

Well, Max, sorry I don't check
out a cat's junk

the second it comes through
the door.

Yeah, you only look
at the face.

That's the difference between
you and me.

See, look, the name tag says
"Cinnamon."

No wonder that little girl
kept crying and saying,

"Give me Cinnamon,
Give me Cinnamon."

I looked her right in the eye
and I said,

"I don't carry spices
in my purse."

Max, you are completely
overreacting.

- It's just a--
- Oh! Just a what?

Say it!

- It's just a cat.
- [gasps]

You!

Hey, I'm the one who fronted us
that dollar to get her name tag.

Thanks to me, someone's gonna
pick her up,

look at it, and say,
"Oh, you must be lost,

little...cat."

Nancy!
Her name's Nancy!

I know her name!

It got momentarily
pushed out of my head

to make room for those 1,600
cupcake T-shirts

we can't unload or pay for.

You think I don't wake up
screaming

four or five nights a week
about those T-shirts?

But I know our cat's name.

You don't wake up
at night ever.

No, I sleep like a dead baby,
it's my one gift.

[phone rings]

Oh, the phone!
[gasps]

Unknown number.
This could be it!

I like my numbers like my condom
expiration dates, unknown.

Hello?

- Yes?
- Who is it, Max?

You have her?
Yay!

Oh, sure, great.

- Thank you.
- He has her?

He has Nancy?

Please, too little,
too late.

Max, we're in $10,000 worth
of debt

and you spent money
on new kitty litter?

Relax, I'm going to pee
in it, too.

Well, I guess it beats
that Sprite bottle

you've been using
in your bedroom.

It's just such a long walk
to the bathroom

that every time
I have to go,

it's like
I'm raising money for MS.

Oh, I have good news.

I found your lost bra
in the litter box.

Don't think I'm not still
wearing it.

I mean, why not?

I ate a hot dog that rolled
under a car the other day.

I left a couple
of big clumps in,

just to help you
out a little.

[knock at door]

Oh, okay, that's Nancy.

Here's a chance
for a fresh start for you two.

And don't bring up the bra,
we don't know why she wanted it,

but I'm sure
she had her reasons.

Fine, I'll be
on my best behavior.

But you watch and see
how she treats me.

It's a two-way street.

Hi, I have your cat.

And surprisingly, your doorknob.

Oh, that gum wore out already?

[gasps]
Hi, buddy!

Hi, I'm Caroline.
This is Max.

Thank you so much
for bringing back--

- Nancy!
- I know!

And please note,
she did not even look at me.

Hi. I'm Owen.

Well, we are "Owen" you
a big thank-you.

Kind of low on cash,
how would you feel

about 1,000 cute
cupcake tees?

Yeah, I don't need
1,000 pink T-shirts.

My dad's already mad at me
I don't care about sports.

How do you get
this thing open?

We usually just take Nancy
around

in an old vacuum cleaner bag.

Also doubles as my
"going out" purse.

Pardon me,
may I get past?

Oh, manners.

In our doorway?

I don't know what to do.

What's next, a front stoop with
no discarded heroin needles?

Yeah, I just came up there.

Not today.

Here, let me help.

I mean, I'm the dumb one who
paid $2,000 for a cat carrier.

Hmm.
I miss being that stupid.

You know, my cat
can't get this open either.

It must be the lack of thumbs.

Rich, funny, and in a suit
at 9:00 A.M.?

I really don't know what to do.

You know, my cat, Dickens,
loves your cat.

Oh, Dickens, after the author?

Dickens, after the author,
Max.

Yeah, I know who that is.

The guy who wrote
Muppets Christmas Carol.

There.
I knew I'd get it.

'Cause I have thumbs.

[baby talk]
Oh, there she is.

[cat meows]
- Yes.

So I take it by the cat,
you're single?

Big time.

So, do you and Dickens
live alone?

Oh no, she's trying to flirt.

I travel a lot for work.

I'm a venture capitalist.

So you know how it is.

Oh, I do.
I absolutely do.

- I...
- Here it comes.

- Went to Wharton.
- Boom.

Well, if she gets lost again,
you know where to find her.

She's been hanging around
outside our window

every day for the last couple
of months.

So I let her in.
I hope that's okay.

Is that okay?
It's awesome.

I hope your girlfriend
didn't mind.

We just broke up.

So I'm single.

And I better get going.

I've got a 10:00 meeting.

Max, give the man his case.

He has a 10:00 meeting.

She doesn't want to get out
of cushy this thing.

I totally get it.

I had to be dragged
out of that massage chair

at Brookstone
by mall security.

Well, here's my card,
just give me a call

when you want me
to pick up the case.

You have a card?

A card, a meeting,
a suit, a joke?

Are you the next bachelor?

Well, thank you,
Owen Charles Boyd,

for bringing back
our beloved--

- Her name's Nancy!
- I know her name.

Why do I have to
say it so fast?

She's joking,
she's just not as funny as you.

Well, it was nice to meet you.

Bye, Nancy.

Okay.

Yes, I was flirting.

But I was doing it
for our business.

You should really be doing it
for your business.

'Cause your business
is going out of business.

He has a card.

And it's not
for medical marijuana.

He's a venture capitalist.

That's the kind of fat cat

that can help us get back
on our feet.

Speaking of fat cats,
Nancy's looking like

she might need to give
Jenny a call.

Hey, girls.

Oh, you found Nancy.

I knew she'd come back pregnant.

Wait, Sophie, how can you tell
she's pregnant

and just not fighting the same
battle Jonah Hill is fighting?

Well, her fur is thicker, she's
got a little sparkle in her eye,

and there's a little kitten head
about to pop out of her patoot.

[Nancy meowing]

Come on.
Push, Nancy.

Come on, we all know
what you did.

Now is not the time to be shy.

You do know what you're doing,
right, Sophie?

This isn't like the time
you told us

you could do your own bikini wax
with a candle?

'Cause I still have the
vanilla-scented scars from that.

Don't worry.

In my village,
all the Kuchenskis women

acted as animal midwives.

It was the best way
to meet guys.

Strap in, girls.

[Nancy meowing]
- Ah! She's crowning!

I can't believe it.

I thought Nancy
was smarter than this.

But it turns out she's just like
the rest of the women

in my family.

Screwed by some stranger
she met in the dumpster.

Okay, here we go.

[Nancy meowing]

Oh, there goes my ring.

I--sorry, Nancy.

(Sophie)
Oh, here we go!

Come on, girls, I need some
hot water and fresh towels.

We do, too.
For, like, four years.

Uh...

how about some
of these T-shirts?

Oh, sure why not use those?

They used to be our
bright future.

Now just a ShamWow
for illegitimate cats.

[Nancy meowing]

Oh, my God,
that must be the sound

of a surrendering
cat uterus.

Well, it's the first time
a uterus has surrendered

in that bed in a while.

[kittens meowing]

I don't know why
I'm not throwing up.

Oh, wait.
I'm starting to.

[kittens continue meowing]

Well, I'm off Korean dumplings
for life.

This one--
this one won't come out.

It's like the Queen Latifah
of kittens.

Sophie, I got your text
that you were in bed with Nancy.

Who is this Nancy,

and when did we go back
to doing three-ways?

Nancy's a cat.

Mm, that's a no.

I've got to draw the line
somewhere.

Well, I heard the news.

Looks like you two are
grandmothers before you're 30.

Can't say I'm surprised.

Okay, before you even ask,

I don't pay
for cat maternity leave.

This isn't Google.

This isn't even
Ask Jeeves, Han.

Well, I can help you
get the kittens good homes.

The people in my building
are very nice.

Except if you don't recycle one
bottle of sparkling cider,

then nobody talks to you
in the elevator.

Han, we're not
giving the kittens away.

Nancy landed herself
a rich cat,

we're gonna be living off
a hefty kitty support.

Only you two
would be desperate enough

to try and find a sugar catty.

So has Owen called you
back yet?

Um, we're trading.

"We're trading"?

"We're trading"
is lonely white girl talk

for "he hasn't called me back."

I can't believe this.
He's a deadbeat dad.

Max, he's just busy.

And I think you might
be projecting a little

because of your dad.

Not that I'm a therapist.

I mean,
I can't even afford a couch.

I'm not projecting.

I just know a deadbeat dad
when I don't see one!

Where's his card?

I don't remember where I--

[gasps]
Max, let go! I've got this.

That guy can really help us
with our business.

Please,
let me handle this.

Look, Ryan Gosling.

[gasps]

- I got this.
- I got this.

- I got this.
- I got this.

Keep going, girls,
I'm almost there.

I got this, Max.

And when he comes to get
the cat carrier,

I'll talk to him.

You're way too emotional.

You just went to third base
with my apron.

Sitting on this stoop
is nice.

How come we never
sit out here?

[gunshots ringing]

[woman shrieking]

There it is.

Oh, please,
it's just Rico.

Rico looks good.
I think he got another tattoo.

Look, when Owen gets here,
should we still be alive,

please let me
do the talking.

Kittens aside,
Owen can help us.

A venture capitalist
buys companies

and turns them around.

Yeah, I've seen
Pretty Woman.

That's how I realized
I wasn't charging enough.

Go, Max, here he comes.

All right, but I'll be watching
inside from the window.

It's probably better, because
I don't trust Nancy alone

with those kittens.

She's got some
serious postpartum.

When I left the room,
she was lighting a Menthol 100

with a shaky paw.

Hi.

Crazy we live walking distance
from each other.

We don't.
The Uber driver

wouldn't go past the fire
hydrant on the corner.

The one with the bloody shoe
hanging from it?

That's the one.

[woman screaming]

You know what? I'm just
gonna take the cat carrier.

Before you go...

we have this small cupcake
company

that's just begging
to be an empire,

and I wanted to pick your brain
about some business stuff.

Okay, so your Dickens
got our cat pregnant,

and she just had five kittens.

And at her age, it's a miracle
we didn't have to pay

for in vitro.

How do you know they are
Dickens's?

I'm not saying
that Nancy's easy,

it's just,
I've seen her go in and out

of a lot of windows.

[police sirens blaring
in the distance]

Did he just drop a gun?

It's fine.
He has more.

Okay, call my assistant,
you can pick my brain.

I just don't want it
to be off the sidewalk.

Really, I got to go.
I can't get killed.

I'm wearing new suede loafers.

Uber, an assistant,
and suede loafers?

Are you for real?

I hope I'm not intruding.

No, come in.

I was just brushing
my new loafers.

I bought them as a break-up gift
for myself.

But unlike my ex-girlfriend,
these have a sole.

I didn't wanna mention the cat
situation to your assistant.

Next thing you know,
it's all over the lunch room:

Owen Charles Boyd's cat
is a raw-dogger.

My business partner
stepped on them.

Said it was an accident.

Didn't feel like one.

One shoe yes, but both?

Highly unlikely.

Owen, sometimes in life,
it's not just an innocent cat

that gets screwed.

A girl can get screwed
as well.

Oh, hey, hi.
What's happening?

As in, screwed by one
bad business decision.

My partner, Max, and I
recently invested

all our savings in--
well, here, take a look.

- [gasps]
- Oh, my coffee!

- Oh.
- My loafer!

My coffee's on my loafer!

Here, let me.

No, you dab.
You don't wipe suede.

You dab.

Dab.
Dab. I'm sorry.

I used to know that.

That's Rich 101.

Let me just go find some water

and I'll dab, not wipe,
this out.

We're not done yet.
I'm going back in.

It's going really well though.

Where's water?

Do you know how to unsend
an email?

If I did, my rich ex-boyfriend
would've never found out

what I thought
of his lisp

and I'd be living in the
"thouth of Franth" right now.

[elevator bell dings]

Where is he?

He needs to see
these adorable bastards.

Max, how did you find me here?

I told you I was going
on a "think walk."

I followed you.

I never noticed how much
you check yourself out

in store windows.
You have a problem.

Do either of you know a way
to turn the phrase,

"self-absorbed, ridiculous pig"
into a compliment?

If I did, I'd still be
on The Apprentice.

Owen's going to see that email

and I'm going to get fired.

I have to start paying attention
to details.

I'm just gonna go back in.

What?
I don't care.

Not without me you're not.

Max, please, let me handle this.

I'm begging you.

We're getting close, look,
I'm holding his shoe.

If he doesn't step up here,

these kittens
will feel neglected,

and it is only
a matter of time

till they are waitressing
or worse.

Max, you're wrong.

There's nothing worse
than waitressing.

Max, stop!

You'll ruin everything.

I can fix this and us.

We are beyond help.

It's all about these kittens.

- Now move, I got this.
- No, I got this.

- I got this.
- I got this.

- I--
- [gasps]

Oh, my God.

What the hell
is happening?

[kittens meowing]

That's right. I came to your
office with a basket of cats.

Max, I'm so sorry.

Yeah, well, he's the one
who should be sorry.

I want you to look
these kittens in the whiskers

and tell them that Dickens
is not their father.

What makes you think
they're mine. Why?

Because they look
just like Dickens

when he was a tiny
baby kitten.

Oh, and this one's even cuter.

And that one.

I'll take them all.

But not that one.
Seems a little off.

Not quite as alert
as the others.

Oh, she's not good enough
for you?

- Max. Projecting.
- I'm not projecting.

He said
she's not good enough for him.

What?

Just because she was unplanned
and not good at math?

Developed boobs way too early?

Okay, fine.
I'm projecting.

What is going on?

Caroline, are we gonna hook up
or what?

This is, like the weirdest
foreplay ever.

Hook up? What would make you
think I want to hook up?

Oh, because I
business flirted?

That's Wharton 101.

It was more
than business flirting.

You begged to come to my office,

show up wearing
a see-through shirt.

That was not by choice.

It is cheaply made.

I came here to talk to you
about our business,

and possibly get you to invest
in a small, but spirited--

Invest? This is the financial
capital of the world.

[baby talk]
Yes, it is.

Why would I invest in a
desperate little cupcake shop?

(both)
You!

That's it!

No cats for you.

(Caroline)
You know what?

You are a self-absorbed,
ridiculous pig.

Says you.

And your assistant.

Check your email.

I was able to unsend it.

Yay!

Yeah, might want to re-ignite
that LinkedIn profile.

You're gonna be home a lot more,
you want a cat?

- [gasps]
[kittens meowing]

Thanks for taking the kittens,
Han.

I feel like you have
an understanding

of small creatures,
being one yourself.

Have no fear, my building
is loaded with lesbians.

They take home rescue cats

faster than they take home
other lesbians.

Okay, let's discuss my terms.

Unlike all my
non-animal children,

I want to know
they're taken care of.

What part of lesbian
don't you understand?

They'll be swaddled
in a flannel shirt by nightfall.

Okay, now this one,
I call Junkie.

'Cause he's got a serious
Catnip problem.

Oh, so you raised a drug addict
within a week.

Sounds about right.

These two should try
and stay together.

We call them
Game of Thrones One

and Game of Thrones Two.

'Cause they're siblings
and lovers.

This one's the boy.

Watch him and learn
what humping looks like.

This one's pretty bland.

She lays around,
doesn't meow much,

and when she does,
she's kind of phoning it in.

We call her Amy Adams.

Yep.

This last one gets
special attention.

She's the smallest,
but she's got potential.

I mean,
look at those nipples.

And now the nipples
are all I see.

Have a nice life.

I'll find you on Instagram.

Check out Grumpy Cat.

Do what he does.

Well, bye, kitties.

And remember,
stripping isn't dancing.

And now all I can see is them
wearing pasties.

You know what, Max?

We don't need that rich guy
to fix our business.

We can do it ourselves.

Who am I kidding?
Our business is in worse shape

than two retired guys
in a golf cart.

Well, you know
what we'd better fix?

Nancy.

'Cause he was right,
she's a slut.

Someone just found her 69-ing
a tabby in the alley.

[cash register bell dings]

Max.

It's the woman at table 2's 50th birthday
and her husband wants us to sing to her.

If I had a dollar every time a man
asked me to do something to his wife,

I'd be a millionaire.

I remember when
Happy Birthday first came up.

I never thought it would catch on.

Go!

And smile.

When you fake smile,

everybody else fakes smile back.

Nobody wants to hear that lame song.

If we want to humiliate her in public, why
don't we go over there and pull her top down?

Come on, let's just go sing
and make the best of it.

Ready?

One, two, three...

♪ Happy birthday to you...♪

Whoa!

I apologize.

It's hard enough your husband took you
to a diner on your birthday

and now you have to listen to white Mariah?

No!

Happy ***.

♪ To yoooooooou ♪

I have announcement to make.

I agree with what Max said before.

What? That we should tie
a little bell around you,

so we know when you're near?

The diner needs a fresh, new way

to celebrate the customer birthday.

So I just went
and wrote a special song.

Han, I'd be happy to look
at what you've written so far.

I took music theory in college.

I once wrote
an entire original musical

based on the French revolution.

Um, sorry to step on your nerd turf,

but Les Mis is already a musical
about the French revolution.

Yes, but mine was from
the point of view of the rich.

What are you going
to rewrite next--

the musical rent from the point
of view of the landlord?

Han, this is
a lovely start, but--

But not good enough.

I know what you are saying.

"You need to practice more, Han.

"You never will be
as good as your sister, Han.

"Whole family going on vacation

without you
while you practice, Han."

Back off, tiger mom!

Hey, Caroline, is Max around?

Um, she might be.
I'll go check.

You'll never guess who
just came into the restaurant.

You'll be very happy.

Gary, the fat guy from teen mom?

Someone you like,
someone you want to kiss,

someone you're hot for.

Tyler, the skinny guy from teen mom?

What's Johnny doing here?

I told him not
to show his face unless--

Unless he broke up
with his girlfriend.

And now he's here, showing his face,

- which means--
- You can't know that for sure.

Fine. Tell me one other reason
he could possibly be in here.

He needs Han to solve
a complex math problem?

Max!

Max, it's pretty obvious
that he's in here

because he broke up
with his girlfriend "Cassandra"

I mean, what else could it be?

When I had millions of dollars,

I had no idea
why guys were coming to see me.

"Do they want me,
or do they want my money?"

But you have nothing!

So basically that just leaves you.

Way to puff me up
before I go through that door.

This is so exciting.

Will you stop?
Don't be such a girl.

Hair? Teeth? Anything?

You're good.

Wait.

More.

- Really?
- Trust me.

Oh, uh, hey, Johnny.
When did you get here?

Uh, just now.

I, uh--I came here

because I want to tell you something.

Yes?

Max, I think you and I
have something special.

And I don't want to lose that.

So I came down here to ask...

Even though it didn't work out,

can we still be friends?

- Oh.
- What?

You have got to be kidding!

Oh.

What's going on over there, Caroline?

My friend Johnny and I have no idea

what you're upset about.

I was just reacting to the
news that we're out of pie.

I really cannot believe it.

I totally thought it would go
a different way.

Caroline...

Why don't you go over there
to the pie carrousel

and mourn the loss of our pie?

So, we're cool?

Yeah, we're cool.
Why wouldn't we be?

We never dated or anything like that.

Of course we're friends.

I am so relieved.

So, uh, you gonna go back

to busting my balls, like always?

Yes.

We're such good friends,
I might just...

Bust them with my feet!

Good morning.

I'm trying to send out
a get-to-know-us email blast

for the cupcake business.

But your wi-fi is so slow.

Don't tell me--
tell cathyhome17,

whoever and wherever she is.

Okay, well, I'm just going

to run down to the coffee place
and send it.

Do you approve?

Nice job.
The font's pretty.

You just gave me a compliment?

I knew it--
you're depressed.

You're so depressed

about you and Johnny
just being friends,

you don't even have the energy
to be you.

What?
The font is pretty.

Oh, honey, do you want a hug?

- I'm fine.
- How could you be fine?

The man was so into you,

he painted a billboard
of the two of you kissing.

And now he just wants to be friends?

Please call in sick
to your babysitting job

and take to the bed.

Whenever I used to get depressed,

I'd take to the bed.

One time, I took to the bed
for a week.

Listen, unlike you, Jane Austen,

I will never take to the bed.

Giving into feelings
is for rich people.

Regular people just have to get up,

get drunk, and go fulfill
their babysitting duties.

Max, take to the bed.

Look, this is my pattern, okay?

I fall for the wrong guy,

I find out they're with a girl,
a bottle, or a needle,

and I move on.

And sometimes I use a bottle
to help me do it...

Or a needle or a girl.

But when I'm done, I'm done.

That's it?

You're just over it?

Wow.

I'm still sad because
Kyle Enright didn't invite me

on his private jet to Mykonos
for his 12th birthday.

Well, not me.

Just flip a switch
and those feelings are gone.

I only have two switches
in my life--

one turns off my emotions,

the other makes a car bounce.

Okay, I better go.

If you get there after 10:30,
you can't hear yourself think

over the sounds of people
skyping to the Philippines.

Max, are you sure you're all right?

Max.

Are you about to come
over here and soft-touch me?

- I want to so bad.
- Leave!

Go to the coffee place.
Soft-touch the barista.

Excuse me, miss.

You keep your door open like that,

this rat's probably
going to get inside.

Don't worry. You should see
the size of my cat.

What are you doing here?

I knew you'd be home for another hour,

so I brought you coffee.

And I wanted to say...

Thanks for understanding
the situation.

Hey, you don't need to get all

"Hallmark presents:
Johnny Soft Eyes" on me.

Okay?
You're not my type, anyway.

You're a bartender
who's close to liquor all night

and your not an alcoholic.

So clearly you don't know
how to seize an opportunity.

Yes, I do.

This is where you join
in birthday song

with your sweet-ass saxophone.

Han, I like you, brother,

but I played with everyone

from Marvin Gaye to the gay Marvins.

They never made it--a little bit
ahead of their time.

But if you don't mind
a professional opinion, man,

you've got to put some heart
into this thing.

But my mother always say
to run away from heart--

only the head can make music.

Han, your mother sounds
like one cold--

Don't you talk about my mama!

Hey, Earl.
What's up?

I just got threatened

by a man who gets carded
at Pixar movies.

Max, great news--

that email blast I sent out
this morning worked.

I just got us a big cupcake job

at some event place
called the gold space loft.

Last time I was
at the gold space loft,

I went to a poetry slam,
and I wound up slamming a poet.

They need 100 cupcakes
by tomorrow night.

And because I'm a genius,

and also because
it's such short notice--

but mostly
because I'm a genius--

I got them up to $500.

It's a cool
group art show--

very Williamsburg, very pot brownie.

And Johnny has a piece in it.

And since you flipped your switch,

I figured it'd be fine.

No way. I can't make
100 cupcakes in a day.

Max, I know it's a lot of work,

but I'll do whatever I can to help.

This is a really big
opportunity for us.

I kissed Johnny.

What? When?

He came by the apartment
right after you left.

I was only gone 20 minutes.

What'd you do--shine
a bat symbol on your vagina?

Stop acting like
I wanted it to happen.

I didn't want it to happen.
I'm lucky we just kissed.

My pants kept saying,
"Take me off!"

And I'm like,
"No, pants."

I'm telling you,
I almost couldn't help myself.

I don't understand.

I thought you said
you were done with him.

What happened to your pattern?

Telling people I have a
pattern is part of the pattern.

Then I just go and do whatever I want.

I knew it, it thought it,
I should have said it--

girls cannot be friends with guys.

Yeah, well, you also knew
he was coming in here

to tell me he broke up
with his girlfriend.

So you can suck it.

Did he say he was going
to break up with her?

We didn't get into it.

We weren't really using
our mouths for talking.

What do you think's going to happen?

I don't know.

All I know is it's not going
to happen at a public art show

in front of him
and his beautiful, cool

British girlfriend.

Max, you don't even have to see them.

We'll get there early,
we'll drop off the cupcakes,

and be gone before any
of the artists even show up.

Great.
I'm going home tonight

after my ten-hour
waitress shift,

to stay up all night
and bake 100 cupcakes

for a guy I kissed
who has a girlfriend.

Beep.

Ooh, what's that?
My self-esteem just flatlined.

Yeah, it's this way.

I smell patchouli and pretension.

Why are you walking so slow?

Because I'm carrying
our cupcake future,

and I don't want half
of our future's frosting

to be on top of the box.

Relax.
We still have time.

Oh, hello.

Welcome to space blast art attack.

The gallery won't be open
for, like, an hour.

Actually, we're here
delivering the cupcakes.

We're looking for someone
named Traivor.

And I'm looking for Traivor's mom,

to ask her why
she named a person Traivor.

Traive!

You girls can set up inside.

He's the one
with the super-tall hat.

I love galleries.

My father and I had an art foundation.

We taught blind kids
how to do ceramics.

Why didn't you just buy them eyes?

Let's put them here.

This art show is ridiculous--

someone named Traivor,

a dreamcatcher
with buzzwords stuck in it.

And you.

Why would he hang that picture of us

if he still has a girlfriend?

Maybe he went home
and broke up with her

after he kissed you.

The writing is literally on the wall.

Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for you again.

Let's just get our money and go.

Oh, uh...

Grown lady dressed like a doll,

we can't find tall hat,

and we need to get paid
for the cupcakes and leave.

Leave?
What are you talking about.

- You're serving the cupcakes.
- Pardon?

Well, why do you think we're
paying you $500 for cupcakes?

Because my friend's a genius.

This is new information.

We need to talk to someone.
Traive!

Oh, no. Traive is busy
installing his ice penis.

I could get someone else
on the show committee to help.

Cashandra!

What's his girlfriend doing here?

- Oh, God!

What if soft eyes wussed out
and told her what happened?

- Does she look mad?
- No, she looks amazing.

Max, hello.

We met that one time on the street.

Cashandra, Johnny's girlfriend.

Oh, hi, hi.
I'm Johnny's friend.

We're just friends.

Hi, "Cassandra."
I'm Caroline.

I was with Max on the street.

And all day yesterday.

We were together every minute.

It's Cash-andra, actually.

But everyone calls me Cash.

And you're Max's
business partner, right?

Yeah, but she makes her own decisions.

Right. Well, let's just
get to it, shall we?

I'm a bleeder.

It's brilliant it all worked out

- with the cupcakes.
- Excuse me?

Well, I told Traive
to hire you for the show.

Johnny cannot stop talking
about your cupcakes, Max.

"Max's cupcakes are so moist."

"Max's cupcakes are delicious."

He loves your cupcakes.

Yeah, yeah.

But just like in a casual way.

I mean, he barely even touched them.

So, um, I'm a bit busy
getting ready for the show.

Why don't you put your little
cupcakes on these trays,

and when people start coming in,
circulate, right?

Circulate, girls, circulate.

Well, that wasn't uncomfortable.

Come on, let's bolt
before Johnny gets here,

while I at least have
a shred of my dignity.

We can't just bail out
of our first big job.

If we do,
people will think we're flakes.

And that'll spread faster
through Williamsburg

than knit hats and herpes.

Hey, you ladies know
where the wine goes?

- Oh--
- Right here.

Yeah.

No! Just, uh, not the wine.
The wine's mine.

Just serving cupcakes.

I've been listening in on Cashandra

and her girlfriends' conversations,

and I don't think she knows
anything happened

between you two.

I also learned she's a dancer,

her lip gloss is from Kiehl's,

and she's school chums with Adele.

Not the Adele.

Damn it!
Could she be any cooler?

I want her to be my girlfriend.

I wouldn't break up with her for me.

Hi. I'm here.

Great. I was hoping
tonight would get weirder.

I had no idea.

She did it to surprise me.

And she did--
I'm surprised.

I am so sorry.

You have a girlfriend.
Why are you kissing Max?

You told her?

Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

Would the more subtle way
be to paint a picture

and hang it on the wall
for all to see?

Are you insane?

Could we have a moment, please?

Fine.

I'll be over there near the ice penis.

Look, I am so sorry.

If I had known Cash was going
to ask you to do all of this,

I would have told you.

And why would you choose to hang that?

'Cause it's my favorite piece.

Is there any way
she could know what happened?

No.

- Oh, my God. Your lips.
- Split up.

I can smell the sex
from across the room.

No-whoa-whoa!
I need all those.

So what?
Is she still your girlfriend?

Max, it's complicated.

What, are we on Facebook?

It is complicated.

Cash and I have been together
two years,

- and when--
- Two years?

Jeez, I'm a home wrecker.

Adele will probably write
a song about me.

You're not a homewrecker.

- I am.
- Johnny!

You've got some folks.

Circulate, Max, circulate.

That's it.
This is over.

That--us on the wall--
never happens again.

I lied.
I can't be your friend.

I was trying to be cool,
but I'm not cool.

I don't know Adele.

What just happened over there?
Did he tell you

he's breaking up with his girlfriend?

No.
What's wrong with you?

You haven't been right about anything?

I told him we are done,
and that's over, okay?

They've been together two years.

And I know one thing about me--
I may pick the wrong guys,

but when I hear
another woman is involved,

I am done.

This is truly the end of my pattern.

We have to go--
I kissed Johnny again.

What?
Max, you said

you were going to the bathroom.

I did.
And so did he.

It's a unisex bathroom--

emphasis on the sex.

We have to go.

I'm a little drunk and out of control.

Traive said we won't get paid

until every single one
of the cupcakes is gone.

- So we're stuck here.
- Fine.

I shall go circulate.

No. You cannot be trusted.

Next thing I know, you'll be
doing him behind the ice penis.

I'm telling you, I am done.

You told me that five minutes ago.

Well, you told me he was breaking up

with his girlfriend three times.

So I guess we learned tonight
that you know nothing about him,

and I know nothing about me.

Cheers!

Wait for me.

Hello, girls.

Traivor told me
you were looking to get paid.

But just to be clear,
you can't actually be paid

until all the cupcakes are gone.

And do me a favor, love,

put a chocolate aside for Johnny.

He loves chocolate.

He'll eat a vanilla if it's available,

but he always goes back to chocolate.

I don't think he's going
to break up with her.

Really?

You have the accuracy rate
of a magic 8 ball.

Look at her.
She's so pretty.

And bitchy.
And...

More pretty than bitchy.

Oh, God.
She just zipped his hoodie

and fixed his hair--
that's a couple.

What they have is real.

They are a couple--
Johnny and Cash.

Oh-ho, crap!
Johnny Cash!

They're an institution.

I never had a chance.

Forget the money--
let's just go.

Mm-mmm.

We are staying till
these cupcakes are gone.

I am not leaving
with no dignity and no money.

Fine, I'll circulate
a couple more times.

Wait a minute.

They said they had to be gone,

but they didn't say
who had to make them gone.

We eat them and go!

You're doing it!
I rescued you from the gutter.

Uh, well, that's
not entirely accura--

Mm-hmm!

Mmm, mmm.

Max, wake up.

It's 3:00.

We forgot to set the alarm.

Oh, I never thought waking up in bed

with another woman
with...Frosting on my boobs,

would be this depressing.

How are you feeling
about it all today?

Do you want to talk?

- No.
- Good.

Where's your purse?

I'm going to take some
of the money we made last night

and get coffee.
And yes--

I am walking down the street
like this,

because after last night,
I am impenetrable to shame.

Wait, we don't have any money.

- Yes, we do.
- No, we don't.

We did, but we don't.

I bought something with it.

I bought this.

You carried that home?
Where was I?

Three blocks ahead of me,

telling strangers about your pattern.

I saw you and Johnny
just hanging there,

and I knew what I had to do.

So what, am I supposed
to hang that up?

No. You're supposed
to destroy it.

You need to get over him,
so you're going to kick this,

and then you're going
to kick him once and for all.

You want to break your pattern?

Start by breaking the painting.

That is a complete waste of money.

I may have been wrong about
everything else about Johnny,

but I'm right about this.
Come on.

Kick it.

I can't.

- Give me your foot.
- What?

Lift up your leg.

Yay! You did it.

Good for you!

You broke a painting
and maybe your pattern.

I really liked him.

I know.

Well?

I slept through my day job,
so what the heck?

I think I will take to the bed
or whatever.

Just for like 20 minutes.

I'll set my alarm and then I'll get up

and get ready for work.

Max, please,
I feel like we need a hug.

We just slept together!
You women are so needy.

MAX:
 Previously on 2 Broke Girls...

Oh, no, Max! My wallet!
It's gone.

All of our cash and our
credit cards were in there.

I need to get to Texas
to see my boyfriend.

There has got to be a way
we can work something out.

We'll do anything.

Just another lonely night
 here in Texas...

with all my new best friends!

Ha-ha!

I'm driving to Texas
if y'all want a ride.

(both gasp)
Shotgun! I'm sitting

next to RuPaul.

No. I'm sitting next to RuPaul!

(upbeat music)

All right.

So, this is where Randy and the
other movie people are staying.

(sniffs)
He's been here. I smell abs.

Ugh, I smell us.

When did I have a hot dog?

I shared one with you while you
were sleeping. You're welcome.

Let's ask that clerk
if he's seen Randy,

and when the outdoor sprinklers
go on so we can freshen up.

Hi. How can I help you?

B-T-dubs, if you're going
for that tossled,

just-crawled-out-of-a-ditch
look,

you nailed it.

I'm not gonna ask
what you just crawled out of,

because I'm too tired
to be mean.

So, Richie,

my associate and I
would like to know

what room Randy Walsh is
staying in.

And I see you have a very strict
"no pets" policy.

Yes, Randy Walsh's room.
Of course.

Looks like he is
in room number...

what hotel clerk in the world
would give out a guest's info

to two dusty randos?

Um, I'm more
than just a dusty rando.

I'm his dusty ex-girlfriend.

Also, well played.

He has friend potential.

Not helpful friend.

Just "tell you
what not to wear" friend.

Well, it's still early,
so hopefully Randy hasn't left--

oh, my God, free cookies!

(gasps) And cucumber water!

With berries!

My nanny used to make me water
like this

before the town car would
take me to preschool.

You had a town car?

My mom was called the town car.

She sat four comfortably.

Can't believe I have to take
a van to set with other people.

I was in Speed.

You were on speed.

And you were in rehab.

And then I rebuilt your career,

and now you have to take a van.

(gasps)
Max, look! It's Randy.

And that guy from the
reverse mortgage commercials.

Ugh! Oh, God!

He can't see me all gross
like this.

I thought your grossness is

one of the things
he likes about you.

Mm, it's complicated.
He likes me to start out clean.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(upbeat music)

*

I am getting really good

at bathing in public restrooms.

And I want it to end!

Well, your hobo skills
are not complete.

You need to practice peeing
in an alley.

You're still splashing
on your shoes.

Now come on.
Let's go find Randy.

Fine.
Let's go ask that concierge

if he knows where it is.

Hey, remember us?

The dust bunnies from before?

I know who you are.

I've been following you two
around with a wet vac.

Bit of an attitude
from someone who's got

two giant horns
coming out of his head.

You're bringing horny
to a whole new level.

Can you please tell us
where the movie set is?

Oh, of course. Absolutely.
No problem.

Just go out the lobby, make
a left on Main, then a right

on There's No Way In Hell
I'm Telling You That Street.

Uh, was that a left or a right

on No Way In Hell
I'm Telling You That Street?

Look. My friend came
all the way here

to surprise her boyfriend.

How would you feel
if someone stopped you

from seeing your boyfriend?

Excuse me? Boyfriend?

I'm not gay.

This is Texas,
not the Flaming Saddles Saloon

on 9th Avenue and 52nd Street
in New York City.

Where you've definitely
never been.

Please just leave my lobby,
all right?

There's enough sad wannabes
around here

with the extras casting...

which reminds me

I need to get to extras casting.

We don't need him, Max.
I have a great idea.

We'll get cast as extras
in Randy's movie.

That way you can see him,

and audiences everywhere
can see me.

Ah, Caroline, that's genius!

While we're waiting,
I'll call Han

to check on the dessert bar's
progress.

Wow. I have an acting career
and I own a dessert bar.

And to think just moments ago

I was tossing water
from a sink to my privates.

Can you call it a whore's bath
if you never have sex?

Can you please tell them
to keep it down?

(loud banging)
A simple "no" would've done.

You don't have to insult
my sweater!

And hello, Max.

(banging)

There's more banging
going on in there

than season one of
 The Affair.

It's really ruining the
fine dining ambiance in here.

What's that, doc?

Is it on my testicle
or just near it?

(banging continues)

Come on!

(baby crying)

And now they woke up Barbara.

And I don't have the DVD
of Amy Adams' last movie

to put her back to sleep.

That's the last straw.
I'm going over there.

I can't stand the sound
of a crying baby.

That's why I'm waiting
a couple years to have my own.

Hey! Oleg.

Come on. Your daughter just got
woken up with that heavy noise.

You should be going over there.

Uh, I'm kind of
in the middle of taking

a "Which Friends character
are you?" quiz.

Ross?

Well, maybe you should be doing
some more manly things

so that when Barbara sees
your picture,

she doesn't say "Mama."

She calls me Mama?

I'm going over there.

I'm not Mama.
I'm Dadushki!

You're being a da-douche-ski.

James jostled Gene gently.

James jostled Gene gently.

James jostled Gene--

Somebody help.
I think my robot's broken.

It's an acting exercise, Max.

It stretches out the mouth.

Uh, I think all those teeth
do the trick.

I just want to be prepared.

I mean, maybe I'm not
just on this journey for you.

Maybe I'm supposed to be
discovered as an actress.

Maybe something's
finally about me.

Everything is
always about you.

You call Christmas "The Day
Caroline Gets Presents."

And we're only auditioning so I
can get to the set to see Randy.

Not for your acting career.

Also, you don't have
an acting career.

Well, shouldn't you
be practicing

what you're gonna say to Randy?

I mean, your original plan
to "jump dem bones"

might not fly on a movie set.

Hey! I got words.

I was thinking something
along the lines of,

"Howdy, Dude-y."

You know, 'cause we're in Texas

and he was kind of a doody
for blocking me.

Okay, extras, since this is
a zombie movie,

I'm gonna need to see you act
like zombies.

But don't touch me. My entire
body's an erogenous zone.

Zombies?
I didn't prepare for that.

You also didn't prepare for
being a celibate poor person,

but you're knocking that
out of the park.

(hammering)

Excuse me, sir...

if that is your real name.

We're from the diner next door,

and you need
to keep the noise down.

It woke up a baby

and the man who lives
in booth two.

Sorry for the loud noise.

If there's one thing
New York's known for,

it's quiet construction.

Listen. You may think you're

some sort of authority figure

with that tank top,

but you're not.

What you are is fired.

Was anyone recording that
for baby Barbara?

Well, that escalated
rather quickly.

Take your gorgeous tank top

and get the hell out of here.

Fine. I don't need this.

My dance company got a grant
from Pfizer.

-Knock, knock.
-Who's there?

Not a door.

The girls are gonna kill me

if they get back and the
dessert bar isn't finished.

Well, Oleg will do it.

He says he can nail anything.

I was talking
about Jersey skanks,

but sure, I'll give it a try.

You're in.

Go wait next to
the corpse extras.

Next.

Hi. My name is
Caroline Channing,

and I will be singing "Hamilton"

from the musical
of the same name.

Hold off on that.

I'm not quite ready
to kill myself.

Are you sure you don't have
any non-zombie parts?

Maybe a cheerleader?

Or a socialite
who lost all her money

but not her looks
or her will to succeed?

But she has lost
everyone's interest.

Uh, fine.

Here we go with a zombie.

(panting)

Here I come! I'm a zombie!

God, I want to go back
to casting commercials

for Applebee's.

You just have to be white
and a little fat.

Or I can do...
mow mow mow mow mow!

Not a zombie.
Not anything.

Hey, are those sodas
up for grabs?

Yeah.

(grunting) Oh-ho! Root beer!

Now, that's a zombie!

Amazing walk and moan.
You're hired.

(gasps)

What?

But she's not an actor.

She can't even pretend
to laugh at my jokes.

(laughs)

You thought that was funny?

No! Boo.

Bad news, Bon Bon:
I can't be in your movie today.

Carlos won't work my shift
at the desk.

We broke--

we had a fight.

Looks like you got the part.
(both gasp)

Congratulations
on me running out of people.

All right, everyone on the van.

We got to get you
to set and makeup.

Oh, wait, Bonnie.
Am I going with,

"Here I come. I'm a zombie."

or "mow, mow, mow, mow,
mow, mow, mow, mow"?

They're both good.

Why do you get to be
a hot zombie?

I look like dead David Spade.

So, David Spade?

And I have this gross axe wound
in my neck.

Oh, I thought that was
a second mouth.

I was worried it was gonna
start telling stories

about how rich it used to be.

I've been working
on my zombie's backstory.

She's a teacher named Jill

with an online gambling
addiction

and an interest in women
she's never acted on.

So, as your lawyer,
can you please stop asking me

for a drunk driver's license?

It's not a real thing.

Neither is a cocaine permit.

Oh, my God, it's Randy.
Hide! Hide!

Hide? Like Jill is doing
with her feelings

for her neighbor Sarah?

Will you run lines with me?

Sure.

You want to take it from,
"You can take my brains,

but you can't take my freedom"?

Max, we came all this way.

You can't just avoid him
forever.

He's not a Hulu original.

Just go tell him what you want.

And what do you want?

Are you planning
on moving to LA?

Because when this acting thing
takes off,

they'll want me
to live there, too.

Who's "they"?

Is "they" all of New York?

(in British accent)
Oi! Drop the brains,

you zombie scum!

Yeah, the script says
"brightly," not "British."

I mean, I can't move to LA.

We've worked too hard getting
the dessert bar to where it is.

I can be happy with
the long-distance thing.

I mean, it's better
than nothing,

and I don't have
to shave as much.

Well, none of that's A-material,

but it's how you feel,

so just go tell him
before he goes off again.

I'm pushing you with my stub.

All right. All right.
I'm going.

Just to make sure
he recognizes me.

Here you are. You two wander off
more than my stepson's left eye.

You're late for your scene.

Um, I just need two minutes
with that guy who just left,

and a condom
if you have one on you.

What do I look like?
The sound guy?

Uh, and I'm gonna need you
to zip that dress up.

This movie's PG.

All right, I'll zip up.

Guess you guys don't want
a sequel.

There. The door,
much like the man who put it up,

is well hung.

Have you ever done anything

without bringing up
your penis size?

Sure. My driver's test.

Oh, wait. No.

Han, hey, just a heads up.

Man, there's literally no one
working in your diner right now.

And that's unusual how?

Well, since I don't have to be
at work, I am going on a break,

which means smoking a J

and taking a nap in the trunk
of my car.

He doesn't even have a car.

How about that?

Earl has superpowers.

The only superpowers he has

is that he's still alive.

Hey, what's going on here?

Fine.
The jig is up.

I can't hang a door.

Sophie, my daughter may think
I'm a mama,

but I don't want her to think
I'm a liar.

Ooh. This went from zero
to Lifetime pretty quickly.

I'm out.

Oh, Oleg,

come on--
it doesn't matter

that you can't build anything
or protect us

or--or--or be a man.

What's really important

is how much you love Barbara.

But she thinks I'm a mama.

Well, she also thinks that
Danny Glover is the president.

Dadushki!

Oh, my gosh, Oleg,
did you hear that?

Yeah. You just said it.

No. No, no, no.
It was Barbara.

Barbara just called you
Dadushki.

She did?

BARBARA: Papa.

"Papa"? What the hell is that?

Eh, she's not very bright.

But thank God she's pretty
like her mamas.

(laughs)

Ugh, my gash is itchy.

You should see someone
about that.

Ugh! This is one of the
least comfortable harnesses

I've ever hung from.

On the upside, it's currently
rounding third base.

Jealous!

Oh, Richie!
How did you get here?

I thought you had to work.

Not that acting isn't work.

Just ask my fellow thespian,
Natalie Portman.

You look like a thespian
in that shirt.

Funny story:
I actually got here

on the None of Your Beeswax
Express.

Ha! He did it again.

Turns out it doesn't get old.

Okay, zombies.
Three minutes till we shoot.

Let me see you wriggle
and moan.

(Max and Richie moaning)
CAROLINE: Mow, mow, mow, mow.

Bonnie, am I moaning
because I am horrified

at what I've become?

Or because I'm in pain
from hanging on this meat hook?

She must be going
to ask the director.

(gasps) Here comes Randy.
How do I look?

Like a piece of meat.

I'll take it.

You were hilarious
in that last scene.

I think everybody's really happy
they didn't get Eddie Murphy.

Eddie Murphy?

I was wondering why I had to
play my whole family at dinner.

This is a comedy?

Well, it's a good thing
I'm so versatile.

I think I'll make Jill clumsy.

Ugh! Where'd they go?
(grunts)

Yeah, meditation has
totally changed me.

I'm not as angry.

Hey! Don't look at me!

Yeah, you do seem calmer.

I wonder why they demanded
your lawyer be on set.

Dude, when we get back to LA,

there's someone I want
to set you up with.

Oh--I need to hear this.
Push me.

She's hot.
But I'm just not dating anyone

who drives a Prius right now.

I don't know.

I'm in a weird place
right now,

and I don't just mean Texas.

You're not still seeing
that girl in New York, are you?

(gasps) What girl in New York?

Me!

Did your brain
get eaten already,

or is Jill just an idiot?

She is just overwhelmed.

She has three kids
under the age of five

and car trouble.

We broke up.

We were Facetiming so much

I felt like I was dating
my iPhone.

The other night at dinner,
we split an appetizer.

Play dead!

Yeah, Max is incredible,

but we're just
in different places right now.

-No, you're not.
-Shh!

I wish I could say
the long distance thing

was gonna be enough for me,

but it wasn't--
it wasn't ever gonna be.

It just can't be enough.

Like you with compliments
about your hair.

(laughs)

You like it, though, right?

You know, I'm doing everything
I can to get over her.

Blocked her on my phone,
went to therapy,

watched all 13 seasons
of Grey's Anatomy,

then realized I'd only watched
20 minutes of one episode.

So, yes or no on my hair?

It's great.

But I'm not ready to meet that
girl with the Prius just yet.

I mean, I'm all for
good gas mileage.

Just not yet.

I get it.
You're gay now.

RICHIE: I wish!

All right,
two minutes, everybody.

Let's do this thing quick,
'cause this movie sucks.

Max, why didn't you
say something?

That was your chance.

Ugh, you heard what he said
to that fake sheriff.

The long distance thing
isn't enough for him,

and he needs to move on.

It's only fair that I let him.

Call me stupid
for being a romantic

and thinking love could
conquer all.

Stupid!

I'm sorry, Max.

What are you doing?

Do you have to pee?

Because I find if you go
in your pants a little

and then a little
and then a little,

it's not that noticeable.

I was gonna give you a hug.

Mm. All right, bring it in.

(grunting)

Ahh.

-You okay?
-No.

My relationship is really over,

and I'm starting to lose feeling
in my downstairs.

Yeah.

Ugh. I'm sorry I dragged you
across the country.

You didn't drag me anywhere.
I wanted to be here with you.

Let's go home, Max.

I'll tell Bonnie we're quitting,

and we'll tell the press
it was exhaustion.

No. We're not going
anywhere yet.

We came all this way.
At least one of us should

get what they want.

You are gonna be in this movie.

(gasps) Max!

I won't forget about you
when I'm big.

I mean, I'll definitely
see you less.

What's that?
Get rid of the blonde zombie?

Oh, thank God.

What? Why?

Was it my "mow, mow, mow, mow"?

Bonnie, wait.
I--I can also write.

Check this line out:

"freezed to meet you."

Cut me down, Bon Bon.
You can't split us up.

Believe me. I've tried.

(cash register bell dings)

(upbeat music)

* *

- Good evening, ladies.
- No.

Max, what are you doing?

I know this neighborhood is a circus,
but our window's becoming a freak show.

Max, I don't think that bearded lady
earlier was doing it on purpose.

It's more
of a menopause thing.

He can't afford a cupcake.
He can't even afford two wheels.

Hi. What can I get you?

- I'll take one vanilla.
- That'll be $4.

Actually, madam, tonight
I'll be paying with a poem.

We're paying
with a poem, madam.

I pull.
Shadows push.

I was a child then.

I was a child then.

Spit it out.

Hey, you want a poem?

Roses are red, violets are blue,
get a job!

And another wheel!

That felt good.
I get why you do that.

Wait till you get actual fist-to-face
contact. That's a real high.

Season 3, Episode 12
"And the French Kiss"

Synced by Reef


Welcome to
the Williamsburg diner, Deke.

Where'd you hear about us?
Kitchen nightmares?

Okay, Max, let's get to it.

We have to decide what we're each gonna
make for our pastry school homework.

Or true to form, I'll blow it off,
beat you up, and take yours.

Of the top of my giant head,
I'm thinking sticky buns.

Deke's dark sticky buns.

We're talking about dessert,
not what's going on in your pants.

Well, I would've baked brownies,
until I remembered

I smoked
all the ingredients.

Oh, my God,
guess who texted me again.

Dame Judi Dench?
Dame Judes texts me all the time.

She's thirsty.

More like,
"Damn, Judi Drench."

Oh, hi, Deke.
Didn't know you were here.

You're everywhere.

Pastry school, on the phone with
Max talking about pastry school,

and now here at the counter
talking about elder sex

with a beloved star
of stage and screen.

- You're like...
- What?

Denzel Washington trapped
in Channing Tatum's body?

I get that a lot.

Anyway, Max,

this is the fourth time chef Nicolas
has texted me outside of school.

And this time
he sent me a video. Look.

Then, Caroline, you spoon
the fat from the pan...

It's him making breakfast
with his shirt open.

What do you think it means?

That he doesn't have
a fear of bacon splatters...?

- He's totally flirting with me, right?
- Totally. Chef Nicolas is hot for ya.

He has to double up on aprons when
you're around, know what I'm sayin'?

Deke, this is just private
best friend stuff between girls.

You know,
that you're not a part of.

Can I not be a part of it?

And since chef Nicolas is your teacher
and I work at the school,

I'd appreciate it if we kept
this just between us three.

And me. I saw it
over your shoulder.

Doesn't hold a candle to my series
of pantless meatloaf videos.

Meatloaf.
Pick up.

Okay, okay, Max, if you have time
to lean, you have time to clean.

And if I have time to give you a punch,
we have time to have lunch.

Max, should we help him
find his mom?

Oh, no, now there's
two of them.

Like gremlins.

Now, come on. This is a diner,
not study hall. You're working.

I call it "spiritually dying,"

but working's a good word
for what we do here too.

We could figure it out
tomorrow night over some drinks.

Couple of white wine spritzers.
Know what I'm sayin'?

That you're a recently-widowed
woman on a girls' trip in Boca?

Well, I already ate my water,
so I'm good to go.

I am out the door.

Hi, I'm Deke.
Bye, Max.

Oh, he's your friend?

For a minute I thought he was that kid
I had out of wedlock with Linda Evans.

Okay, why are you in here not working?
And why are you doing it without me?

Look, I've been texting with Nicolas.
He thirstay.

He wants me to meet him for a drink
after his dinner tomorrow.

After his dinner.
You know what that means.

That he thinks he doesn't
have to buy you dinner

before he makes you
his slam piece?

"After dinner"
is a Booty call.

Or as they say in France,
"A call du bootay."

So I need you
to hang out with me,

because if I don't have anything
else to do at that time,

I won't be able
to resist him.

I don't see it.

Maybe because he never pulled a knife
on me, but to me he's, like, asexual.

Yeah, like a sexual object.

Okay, well, I told Deke I'd help
him with his homework,

so you can
hang out with us.

Hang out with Deke?
I didn't even like the Muppets on TV.

But fine, it'll...
It'll keep me busy,

because Max,
when Nicolas looks at me,

it does something
to my insides,

and I want this
to be a relationship

before he does
something to my insides.

If you keep talking about your insides,
I'm gonna kick you on your outsides.

Okay, so as far
as my dessert homework goes...

He just texted me again.

"Ou es-tu?"
"Where are you?"

And he used "tu",
not "vous."

We've gone there.

Then why are you still here?

Because I can't go there, Max,
I'm not ready.

Oh, wax situation?

Guys don't care about that.

So as far as my dessert goes,
I went all-out

and actually did
some real research.

- You googled desserts with dirty names?
- Correcto.

And it was harder
to pick one than I thought.

I mean, you got your bundt cake,
your lady fingers,

kumquat pie...

"Kum" and "quat".

It was right there the whole
time. How could I not see it?

So I dug deep,
and I have the winner.

Croquembouche.

I don't know what that is,
but she sounds like a whore.

It's a traditional
French wedding cake

with vanilla cream-filled profiteroles
dipped in hand-made caramel.

Said the only person here
not in pastry school.

Oh, cool.
I didn't know what it was.

Maybe I can help. I happen to know Nicolas
loves a pear tarte tatin.

Ta-ta-tan! No.

I thought I'd distract myself
by going out with you guys,

but it feels like
the day in high school

I hung out with the smokers
for street cred.

And I used to hang out with rich geeks
like you when I needed lunch money.

I'm texting Nicolas.

What? You said you didn't
want him to think you were up

for a wham-bam,
thank you, mademoiselle.

You're right, Max.
I shouldn't text him.

He just texted me again.
What's one drink?

$18...?

It is?
Yeah, you better text him.

We need a grown-up
to pay for the drinks.

I'll just say I'm with friends,
and he can join for a drink.

Isn't that what people do?
I forget.

I haven't been a person
or done anything in so long.

Or done a person in so long.

I won't let it get that far.

And by that I mean you won't.

I'll give you a signal and then
you'll say we have to go.

What's the signal?
Full penetration?

- No, before that.
- So, just the tip?

I think I'll just wink.

So, croquembouche?

I can't pretend to talk.

I hope his tongue
is wearing protection.

Hey.

Are we making you
uncomfortable?

No, no, it's just that
I usually like to fast-forward

through the kissing parts
when I watch porn.

Come on, relax, Max.
We're just having some fun.

It's just that you're our teacher,
and your spittle is all over her mouth.

We're not in class.
Do you see batter or bowls?

Well, we're hoping
not to see any balls.

I see the outline
of one of 'em.

Just don't think of me
as a teacher right now.

Well, I'm kind of
learning a lot.

You know, for someone
who wasn't gonna have sex,

she's having sex.

I'm leaving.

I haven't felt this awkward

since my mom had sex with my prom
date in the limo and made me drive.

Your mom sounds cool.

Come on, you can't leave.
We just got here.

Well, she's about to get there,
and I don't wanna see it.

Well, we can make out.

You wanna make out? With me?

No, a comedy make-out.

You know, like...

Well, you make it look
so tempting.

Come on,
it'll be hilarious.

Let my mouth be
your tongue's panic room.

And chef Nicolas
could use a few pointers.

Yeah, he's really
bad at it.

All right, why not? It might
even get their attention.

On the count of three.
One, two...

- Did they look?
- No, he's busy rounding third.

My turn.

Max, what's happening?

Hey.

He's licking your face.

Leave them alone.

Deke seems to know
what he's doing.

Respect.

Well, hate to comedy
make out and run,

but, well, I'm already
mentally at yummy donuts

trying to binge eat
this image out of my mind.

Hold on, Max. The signal.

See, this is why
I don't do girlfriend.

Come on, we have somewhere to go
or be, something like that.

Well...

We have to go.
See you later.

Au revoir.

'Sup?

Not much.
'Sup with you?

Sorry, I have to get this.
It's my wife.

Hello?

Girrrl...

Oh, I totally forgot to tell you.
You're terrible at making out.

Well, I never had
a father to teach me.

Hey, big Mary.

Hallway lunch.
Love that for you.

And you.

This could've been your walk of shame
right now if I hadn't stepped in, Winky.

Yes, last night
got a little out of hand.

Oh, it was pretty much
in your hand.

No, it was not, Max.

Yes, there might have been
a tasteful graze,

just to figure out
how European he was down there.

Good news, it's not
wearing a floppy beret.

So we are right on track for
a perfect fairy-tale romance.

Yeah, the princess
and the penis.

See you at the diner, Max.
Au revoir, mes amis.

I have to kinda
tell you something

that you have to promise you
kind of definitely won't tell Caroline.

Are you about to tell me
that when she speaks French

it makes you want to slam your head
through that plate-glass window too?

Heh. Well, the thing is
he's married.

He's married?
How do you know?

He's not wearing a ring,
and he doesn't seem dead inside.

- His wife called him after you guys left.
- How could he do that?

- He's French?
- And not tell Caroline.

- He's French?
- What a jerk.

Fronch?

I'm telling her right now.

Wait, wait, wait, Max,
do me a favor...?

Can you just wait until after
I turn in my croquembouche?

I'm already on thin ice
with "au bon pain in my ass."

This sucks.

He's married, and Caroline
has this weird thing in her head

that she has to marry
someone who isn't married.

Bonjour, Bebe. Ca va?

Oh, boy.

I'm not really good
with any languages.

They think it's because
I got hit by three cars.

FYI, if you ever get hit,
just stay down.

Well, guess what.

I got you and me salads.
Girls' lunch.

Well, I usually just have peanut
butter and crackers in the dark...

I hear so much about salad
I've always wanted to try it.

Sure. Sit. Have some salad.
You and me, me and you.

Getting to know
more about each other.

So Bebe, tell me
everything about Nicolas.

He's the best. He has
the heart and eyes of a dog.

- So Nicolas, where do you think he is?
- He just said he had a lunch date.

Date? Did he use the word "date," or
are you just using the word "date"?

I mean, it's not like he's dating anyone.
Is he?

No, why would he
be dating anyone?

Exactly, why would he
be dating anyone?

Yeah, I mean,
he's married.

Married?

You know, salad tastes
just like lettuce.

You are not
going to believe this.

Kendall Jenner
is applying to colleges?

Come on, Max, no.

Nicolas is... and get ready...
Married.

I kissed a married man.
I'm so mortified.

Please don't ever tell anyone
I kissed a married man.

Okay, I won't tell anyone.

- Tell anyone what?
- Caroline kissed a married man.

But don't tell anyone.

All right, I want to go on the record
that I didn't know.

Kissing a married man has never
been in my life plan.

It's not on my vision board
or in my dreamscape.

I am not that kind of person.

But she is the kind of person
who has a vision board

and says "dreamscape,"
so let's judge her on that.

I won't judge you, Caroline.

I once went out
with a married woman.

I didn't know she was married until
her spouse came and beat me up.

Lesbians are strong.

Listen, married, not married,
don't be so American.

You know, in Poland,
the wedding vows say,

"Do you take this woman..."

"And maybe some others?"

Well, not Polish,
and not a lesbian yet.

So I'm very upset.

And, Max, why are you
just standing there?

Why haven't you
said anything?

Um...
I kind of knew.

Wait. You kind of knew
he was married?

You kind of knew and didn't
kind of tell me?

- What kind of friend are you?
- I just found out myself.

Well, then why didn't
you tell me?

I was going to,
but then Deke asked me not to

until he handed in
his homework.

And also I thought
you might cry.

- Oh, and you didn't want to upset me?
- Nah, I didn't want to deal with it.

'Cause when you cry, you don't just
cry once. It's like a six-cry thing.

You've got the first shock cry,
the silent cry,

the ugly cry,
the cry because you're crying,

the cry after you say
you're not gonna cry anymore,

and then the final cry,
which is probably my fault.

Well, you're wrong, Max,
I'm not gonna cry over this,

because I haven't gone
far enough down the road.

Yes, I was just beginning to think about
our future, but I'm not that invested.

- Then what's this?
- My dupe pad.

That's right. And look what
I found written on the back.

"Caroline and Nicolas
Saintcroix."

"Mr. and Mrs. Saintcroix."

"Caroline Saintcroix."

That's just being silly.
Every girl does that.

You're 40.

- Oh, man, this is heavy.
- I know, very heavy.

We're back here,
and I have to deal with the fact

that I was dry-humped
by a married man.

No, I think he meant
his dessert is heavy.

But yeah, you got
a lot going on.

So what do you
want us to do?

Should we throw down?
Mess his ass up?

Kick him in the face?

Or just ignore it so I don't
get kicked out of school?

No, I'll deal
with Nicolas later.

You sure? 'Cause I've always
wanted to kill a French person.

Again.

Thanks, but stay out of it.
I've got this.

I'm gonna rip him
a new one.

- Bonjour, Caroline.
- Bonjour, Nicolas.

That wasn't a rip.
Wasn't even a tear.

Go, go, you two.
Got a big, hot bundt here.

Go, go, don't be late.

You sure that's
a croquembouche?

'Cause it looks like a
coyote poop tree.

Caroline, can you
watch the phones for me

while I give chef Nicolas
this note from his wife?

You know what?
I'll give it to him.

I have something
I have to say to him anyway.

Oh, for next girls' lunch,
have you ever had sandwiches?

'Cause I'm thinking
of trying one.

Not you.

You have got this.
You have got this.

You broke up with a Kennedy cousin.
You can do this.

Caroline,
do you need something?

I just wanted to give you
this phone message you just got.

From your wife.

From your wife...
Juliette...?

- I know her name.
- You're married.

Yes, you just got
a message from my wife.

I feel like something's getting
lost in the translation here,

so let me be clear.
It's over between us.

Why?

Why?
Because you're married.

Again, I know that.
But why?

What... what do
you mean "why"?

Why? Because you are married.
Vous est marie!

And note, I did not
use "tu"

because we are back
on the more formal "vous" terms.

Look, Caroline, my wife is in France,
and we have an understanding.

Well, I'm having a hard time
understanding any of this.

And whatever arrangement you and Juliette
have, it's over between you and me.

Here.

You are very cute
when you're angry.

I am?

Actually, you are very cute
all the time. Cute and sexy.

From the moment I saw you,
I wanted to...

- Put my lips onto yours.
- You did?

Yes.

Caroline, you are a smart,
sexy, delicious woman.

And now that I've kissed...
Do you have something in your eye?

No, no, no, no, no.

It's never you!

I'm sorry, what is happening?

Chef Nicolas, uh, you need
to get back in there

because the chef
with the neck tattoo

is trying to pass off
a store-bought tiramisu.

There is one every year.

Caroline.

Are you okay?
What did he say?

He said he's married, and
it's confusing, and I'm delicious.

Okay, well, he's married, it's
confusing, and you're delicious.

So you're
Mrs. Delicious Saintcroix.

So it's over, right?

Yeah, of course it's over.
No drama, no more crying.

- I would never be with a married man.
- Yeah, that's more my thing.

Oh, my God, Max, you know
what I just realized?

I once said I would
never be a waitress.

Girrrl...

Synced by Reef


Pick up!
Tables 12, 4, 11.

Got it.

Hey,
when you get a second,

stop looking at my boobs.

Excuse me.

Waitress?

Dude?

Hi, what can I get ya?

We need some...

Is that annoying?

Is that
obnoxious and rude?

Would you find it distracting
if someone did that to you

while you were working?

Oh, you don't have a job.
Sorry.

Damn, dude,
she burned you.

Oh.

No, hipster.

Do not think we're on the same
team. We have nothing in common.

I wear knit hats
when it's cold out.

You wear knit hats
'cause of coldplay.

You have tattoos
to piss off your dad.

My dad doesn't know
he's my dad.

You think...

This is the sound
that gets you service.

I think...

This is the sound
that dries up my vagina.

The other waitress
disappeared, the Russian one.

We need horseradish.

Please.

That, ladies,
is how you treat a waitress.

Paulina!

Oh, so... so good, oh...

Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
you were on break.

I just need
some horseradish.

- Here.
- Oh, cool.

Excuse me,
where's my waitress?

She's coming.

Earl.

Earl!

I made your favorite,
red velvet.

My little cupcake
brought me a cupcake.

Oh, no, no.
It's on the house.

It's your birthday.

How old are you gonna be?

75.

Oh, Earl, if you were just
three years younger.

Max, Max, big news.

The new boss fired
that Russian waitress, Paulina.

Turns out Chesty Kournikova
was Vladimir puttin' it out.

Hello today.
I have paycheck for you.

I need to talk to you.
You fired Paulina, Han?

I am no longer Han Lee.

I have new American name

to go with
changing neighborhood.

To go with
the changing neighborhood.

You need to remember this
for your immigration exam.

Correct. To go with
the changing neighborhood.

Bryce?
Your name is Bryce Lee?

Wait, wait,
um, um, um...

Don't hire a new waitress,
okay?

I've been doing
all the work anyway,

and I really could use
the extra money.

You need help.

- No, I don't.
- Everyone need help sometimes.

I don't. I've been waiting
my whole life, okay?

I've waited on tables,
I've waited in bars,

I've waited on
home pregnancy tests.

I already hire new waitress.

She work in all top restaurants
in Manhattan.

I gave her
Paulina's uniform.

Hi.

Mr. Lee,
not to complain,

but I think someone
wore this uniform before me,

like right before me.

Is it possible
that I could get another one?

Maybe one that's
a little less moist.

Also this mustard color doesn't
really go with my skin tone,

neither do
the mustard stains...

And these
various other stains,

and smells.
I hope that's clam chowder.

So...

I think it'd be better
for everyone,

including
my immune system,

if I just keep on wearing
what I'm wearing,

and not the apron,
'cause this is Chanel.

So thank you,

and let's waitress.

Whatever that is,

it does not belong
in this diner.

It belongs
in a show on Bravo.

But she blonde,
hair so shiny,

good for business.

Where do you even
find these people?

The Russian hooker, the one
before that was a meth addict.

You train her,
I am boss.

- Da boss.
- Oh.

Fine, but make her
wear the uniform.

Are you sure we can't get
the meth addict back?

She was really good
at cleaning.

But her teeth
fall out.

You are really judgmental,
you know that?

I'm only gonna say this once,
so pay attention.

I'm Caroline, by the way.
And you're Max?

Don't get attached.

This is the Williamsburg diner,
owned by Han Lee,

who just changed his name
to Bryce Lee,

because I guess he wants people
to take him even less seriously.

Eight months ago he bought it
from the Russian mob.

Clientele used to be
all eastern bloc criminals

and crack whores, but then
he took it over and ruined it.

Hey, sexy woman.

You look so pretty today.

You look so beautiful, I forgot
how bad your personality is.

Thanks, Oleg.

Hey, Barbie.

He will hit on you
aggressively and relentlessly.

He doesn't realize
he looks like that,

and I don't have the heart
to tell him.

Could we have some menus?

Oh, sure.

Don't smile.

'Cause it raises the bar,
and then I have to smile,

and I can't be doing that.

It's exhausting
and I have a bad back.

That's Earl,
we're in love.

Do not talk to him,

unless you want to feel whiter
than you already are.

Oh, and that stain?

Not clam chowder.

Go marry the ketchups.

Marry the ketchups.
I'm on it.

Okay.
Now divorce the ketchups.

Stop.
Just stop.

There's no such thing
as divorcing the ketchups.

You've never waitressed
a day in your life.

Yes, I have.

You expect me
to believe you

after watching that whole
Temple Grandin routine?

- I'm telling Lee.
- Okay, okay,

I may have enhanced
my resume.

Enhanced?
What, are we in Paris?

Please,
I really need this job, okay?

We lost all of our money.

My trust fund was taken
for legal fees.

My dad is in jail.

What? What are you,
Martin Channing's daughter?

Where's the paper?

Martin Channing?

The guy who ripped off
the entire city is your father.

He told us we were
having a good year.

You're
Caroline Channing.

You're like
a billionaire.

Was.
Was a billionaire.

They froze all our assets,
everything's gone.

I only have
what I could grab,

and I grabbed
all the wrong things.

- So do you know the president?
- I've met him.

- He's hot.
- He's the president.

- Have you been to Switzerland?
- Yes.

- Do you have a horse?
- Yes.

- Do you know Paris Hilton?
- No, she's a hundred.

Excuse me, uh,
two hot chocolate, please.

- Comin' up.
- It...

let me do that, please.

I'm a really
fast learner.

I went to
Wharton business school.

I got 2,300 on my SAT's

Can you make a hot chocolate,
or not?

Nailed it.

We split the tips.
Give me yours.

You did better
than I thought you would.

Listen, tonight
I thought of a way

we could make
some extra money.

They've totally
underestimated

the price point
on those red velvet cupcakes.

In Manhattan the asking price
is at least seven,

so we could sell them for seven,
and then pocket the difference.

Nothing about that
sounds wrong to you?

It's not our fault that
the idiot who makes the cupcakes

doesn't know their worth.

I'm the idiot
who makes the cupcakes.

New information.

That's stupid.

No one would pay $7
for one of my cupcakes.

Really?
'Cause...

Well, at least we know
you're not adopted.

So how'd you even
end up in Brooklyn?

Oh,
I went on monster.com.

Typed in
"place where nobody

from the Upper East Side
would ever go, ever,"

and this diner came up.

You can't wear
a fancy leather jacket

outside in this neighborhood.

You have to turn it
inside out.

Oh.

Fur. Cool.
Turn it back.

So where do you live?

Our townhouse was taken
and bolted up by the bank, so...

Is this where I'm supposed to
feel sorry for you?

I mean,
I don't want you to,

but just so you know,
a well-adjusted person would.

I'm dead inside.

You make that
pretty obvious.

Anyway, I'm just gonna stay
in the city with a friend.

I live a couple of blocks
that way.

I'd walk you to the subway,
it's just that I don't want to.

- Okay.
- Okay.

♪ ♪

Why is the music so loud?

Whoa!

It's 3:00
in the morning.

I'm sorry.

It's cool.
So what are you doin'?

The band's practicing.

But you're not
playing any instruments.

Yeah,
that's how we practice.

We, like,
listen to other good music

and play it in our head.

It's like The Secret.

Well, I have a secret
for you guys.

- Get out!
- Whoa!

- Uh, you guys better go.
- We should go.

Sorry, guys, I still
have to make the cupcakes.

Cupcakes? For why? You can
just buy 'em at the store.

You can do that in
the morning, babe, come to bed.

No, I can't. I have to
be in the city by 10:00.

Fine.
You can have three minutes.

Fine, you can have eight,
one for each ab.

Boom!

Stand clear
of the closing doors.

Well, I can cross that
off my bucket list.

Hey.

I have a taser!

Oh!

Oh, my God.

I am so sorry.

I didn't think it would hurt
so much. It's pink.

It didn't feel pink.

I didn't know it was you.
I thought I was being raped.

That's not
what rape feels like.

Did you...

did you
sleep on the subway?

I had nowhere else to go,

and I'm too afraid
to sleep outside on the street.

God, you're spoiled.

Next stop, greenpoint.

Ugh! Get your stuff. Come on,
I'll take you to my place,

but hurry.

'Cause I have to be
in the city in 30 minutes.

Call me.

Oh, my God,
you've been robbed!

This is
how it always looks.

Oh, my God,
totally cute!

All right,
I'll be back at 4:00,

and we can go to work together.
Bathroom, bedroom,

boyfriend sleeps till 4:00,
yard.

Oh, you have a yard.

Looks like a really nice place
to relax and do crack.

It is.

I gotta go, I'm gonna be late
for my other job in the city.

You have two jobs?

Yes, I babysit
for a Manhattan socialite diva.

Now I have a set.

Sorry I'm late.

Oh, thank God
you're here,

there is
a bridge and tunnel smell

over by the babies
that's stressing me out.

Their diapers
probably need to be changed.

Again? I swear,
the morning nanny just did that.

Motherhood is for reals.

Max, remind me,
what's my Twitter password?

Twitter password.

Yes!

Hi, Brad.
Hi, Angelina.

Max, I need to tell you
something because we're family.

Now get me room temperature
water and come over here.

We are victims
of the Channing Ponzi scheme.

Me, David,
and Brangelina.

How much money
did you lose?

Hold my hands.

Nothing.

But it really scared me.

Open that?

So do you know
Caroline Channing?

No,
but she lost everything.

She has no money.

Can you imagine
having no money?

I mean, you wouldn't even
have any money.

You should twit that.

And no one
will even talk to her.

I heard she went
to six different friends' houses

for a place to stay,

and they all had to pretend
they weren't home.

- That's not cool.
- Yeah.

- That's really sad.
- So sad.

Breaks my heart.

I guess motherhood has really
opened me up emotionally.

Max, I need to hold
one of the babies,

bring me one.

No, the other one.
That's not the good one.

Hello.

Oh, hi. Oh, I'm so sorry
if I woke you up.

Who are you?

I'm Max's friend.
Uh, don't tell her I said that.

I have a feeling if she heard me
call her my friend,

she'd stab me.

What are you doin'
over there?

Just washing my uniform,

trying to make it
a little more cute

and a little less crusty.

Oh, watch out!

Oh!
Sorry, oh, my...

- Do you have a towel or a rag?
- No, I... I got it.

Oh, okay.

I'm Robbie.

I'm uncomfortable.

You're getting me wet.

That's the point.

You're Max's boyfriend.

It's cool.

No, it's not.
Back up, Jersey shore.

You're pathetic,

and that's coming from someone
who's homeless

and wearing white
after labor day.

And I've seen better.

No, you haven't.

Hey.
Why didn't you wait for me?

I thought we were
coming over together.

Oh. Um, I wanted to get here
early to marry the ketchups.

Listen,
I heard something

really upsetting
about you today.

What did he say,
that I came on to him?

Him who?

Nothing.

Him, Robbie?

It's none of my business,

but you deserve better
than that guy.

Yeah,
it is none of your business.

Ooh, I was just starting
to feel sorry for you.

I'm just saying,
you're worth more than that.

What, I'm supposed to
believe you about this?

The person who lied
on their resume,

and lied about the cupcakes...
you're a liar.

- I'm just trying to help.
- You know what?

Since you seem to know
so much about everything,

why don't you
take your Wharton degree,

and your ridiculous coat, and
figure this all out yourself.

Max.

- Max, wait.
- Oh, look,

the arcade fire concert
just let out across the street,

good luck with that.

She's coming back,
right?

She's not gonna
leave me here alone

with a restaurant
full of people?

Let me put it to you
this way.

You might as well be

a night maid
at the Schwarzenegger house.

You got screwed.

- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

That feels so good.

Now put your tambourine
around it.

Hi, honey, I'm home.

I want you gone
by the time I get back.

Babe!
Babe, I can explain.

You weren't
supposed to be home.

People say
I deserve better than you.

Who?

That blonde girl? She doesn't
know what she's talkin' about.

She went to Wharton

and Switzerland.

Yo, yo.
Look at that.

That girl is
workin' harder

than Stephen Hawking tryin'
to put in a pair of cufflinks.

Here, let me help you
with that.

I don't need any help.

Everyone needs help
sometimes.

This isn't
what I ordered.

This is Caroline.

She may have gotten
your order wrong,

but she does
get some things right.

Thank you.

No, thank you.

What'd you see in that guy,
anyway?

He had these
muscle thingies.

- Oh, those things?
- Yeah.

I don't know
what those are called,

but they make smart girls
stupid.

Max!

I thought your tight ass
wasn't coming in tonight,

and my heart
broke in half.

You know what, Oleg?

I needed that.

So, um...

I need a roommate,
if you want to crash.

Hmm.

Not gonna lie, the subway's
cleaner than your couch.

Wow.

I just felt myself
starting to like you.

Really? Because I really feel
like we could...

I knew that wouldn't last.

Come on.

Tomorrow we can
go into the city

and get
the rest of your stuff.

Everything's locked up.

What, you have nothing that
you care about that we can get?

Well,
there is one thing.

The weirdest thing
is that nobody stopped us.

I'm gonna save
a fortune,

keeping him here
instead of in the stables.

When did you put this whole
horse-in-my-yard thing together?

I can't help it.

I see an opportunity,
and I make it happen,

like with your cupcakes.

Like what
with my cupcakes?

Ready?
To open a bake shop,

all we need is
250 grand start-up money,

for the real estate,
and the basic equipment...

Yeah. Oh.

- 250 grand, that's all?
- Yeah.

Did freakin' Chestnut here
kick you in the head

while I was in Starbucks?

Hear me out.

If we both worked two jobs
and made $2,000 a week,

we could open a cupcake business
in a little over a year.

In the past two days,
we've made $387,

and that's a good start.

We can make extra money
at other jobs,

like publicists,
advertising executives...

Janitors, drug mules.

We really need to
work on your self-esteem.

So...

You, cupcakes,
me, business background,

us, success.
What do you think?

I think
you have a horse.

I think we have a horse.

Don't get attached.

Listen up, everybody.

Something strange is afoot.

Don't be hard on yourself, Han.

You're taller than a foot.

What's wrong? Somebody rub
your belly for luck again?

No, I think I might
be losing my memory.

According to Netflix,
last night I watched

half the "Taken"s and
all the "Insidious"es-es.

All of them!

Relax. You probably
just sleep-watched them.

And you probably also sleep-ordered

28 boxes of tampons on Amazon.

Max, you hacked into my accounts?

That's illegal!

And beyond what I thought you
were intellectually capable of!

Not much of a hack when
the password is "Hanstoppable."

That's a breach of trust, girls.

Did you order me those shoes?

Dammit! I should have gone
with "Han Golden Pond."

♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

[cell phone chimes]

Oh, this is weird.

There's a message from Bernard,

my grandmother's butler.

Why would he be calling me?

Maybe he butler-dialed you.

(Bernard) Caroline, hello.

I'm calling on behalf
of your grandmother.

Wait, she abandons me after
four years with no explanation

and now she reaches out?

Now? [scoffs]

There is no excuse for that.

(Bernard) She's been in a coma.

Okay, there's one excuse for that.

But she's awake now
and wants to see you.

Max, she wants to see me.
I'm going to go call him.

She didn't shun me,
she was just practically dead!

Max, can I ask your
opinion about something?

If Sophie and I want to get pregnant,

she needs to be on drugs.

Oh, to have sex with you? I get that.

No, fertility drugs.

I haven't paid this much for
sex since Orgy Cruise '08.

So I'm going to ask Han for a raise.

What do you think?

I think that'll be fun to watch.

Well, I've come up with a new password

that none of you will ever guess.

Han-ah Montana?

Dammit!

Lookin' good, Han.

Have you been shopping
at Men's Wearhouse?

'Cause I like the way you look.

You know I exclusively
shop at T.J. Maxx.

They've been helping me
spring into summer for years.

Hey, everybody!

Oleg, what happened?

Did you ask that little
Korean girl for a raise?

Max, my grandmother wants me
to come and see her tomorrow!

This is so exciting.

Someone in my family is alive
and not in federal prison.

That is exciting.

How much money do you
think we're getting?

She's rich, right?

I can't believe all this
time she was in a coma.

I can't believe you
knew someone in a coma

and I didn't get to draw
a mustache on them.

Hello, Caroline.

Your grandmother's place is fancy.

I'm just gonna say it.

I don't think anybody
has ever peed in there.

(Caroline) Bernard!

You haven't aged at all.

Thank you.

She hasn't been awake
to guard her creams.

Oh, this brings back so
many childhood memories.

Right here is where we had
our 14-foot Christmas tree.

And then right here is where
she'd give me her yearly hug.

Well, Caroline, have you
bounced back from the scandal?

If you count working at a
diner, sleeping in a wall,

and clothes shopping at CVS,
then she's real bouncy.

And is this your same-sex partner?

I will be if that gets me in the will.

Bernard, this is Max.
She's my roommate.

Yes, that's what we called
them back in the day.

[bell rings]

Oh, she's found the bell.

Lucky me.

But that was just a single dingle.

A warning dingle.

[bell rings]

Double dingle. Mayday.

Grammy Astrid, it's Caroline!

I know, darling. I'm old, not blind.

I've missed you so much.

Careful. Don't get her overexcited.

Crack a window.
Smells like Ass-trid in here.

I suppose I should conserve my energy

for the luncheon you're
going to throw me.

What luncheon now?

The one you're going to throw

to re-introduce her to society,

a sort of coming out party.

Isn't that more your turf?

Grammy, I'd be happy to
throw you a luncheon

but I can't afford...

Gah! [clears throat]

Sorry. Caroline, never mind all that.

Introductions are in order.

Oh, Grammy. This is my friend, Max.

Hey, uh, I guess, welcome back.

You haven't changed a bit, Caroline.

Always making friends with the help.

Maria, was it?

I'll take a tall glass
of agua, por favor.

Hoping there's a Maria behind me.

Caroline, how have you been?

Are you running Wall Street yet?

No, but I did cut my hair,
which was scary but rewarding.

Grammy, a lot has changed
since I lost all my...

Gah!

Seriously, dude, get an x-ray.

Outside. Now.

And still waiting on that agua, Maria.

Ay, yi yi.

Okay, Bernard, what's with the "gahs"?

You interrupted what I
was saying so often,

it's like we're a married couple.

I was trying to stop you

from mentioning your father's scandal.

Oh, I thought that's just
how British people fart.

Your grandmother has no
memory of what happened.

When I attempted to
tell her the bad news,

she had a stroke and
slipped into a coma.

I said, "Your son might
be in some trouble,"

and that was it; she was out.

She doesn't know I lost all my money?

I know. It's terrible.

And what's worse is you have
to tell her she's lost all hers.

She's broke?

Then why did I get her that water?

Hey, girls. Buckle up.

Oleg's gonna ask Han for a raise again.

Hot stuff, coming through.

Oh look, it's Chef Boy-Are-You-Gross.

Nice hat, right?

He wears it in the bedroom
when we role-play.

I'm the fussy customer,

and he slathers butter on my biscuit.

This isn't the whole costume.

I also wear a drumstick paper
frill around my penis.

Boner appétit.

Oh, here comes Han.

It's showtime, baby.

Well, I have a new password

that no one will ever get.

"Straight Outta Compt-han"?

Dammit!

Mmm! This food is so good.

My compliments to the
man who hired the chef.

Oleg, you're not getting a raise
just because Sophie can act

like your food is yummy in her tummy.

Would you change your mind if
I did it in a different accent?

I used to act in Poland.
I can do a whole bunch.

[Southern accent] Mmm! My word.

I just love this tasty tortellini.

Mm-hmm!

Thank you for tonight's nightmare.

Uh, table for one?

Not for this one, thank you.

Bernard, hi. What are you doing here?

I could ask the same
of you and follow up

with a series of questions
about that hideous uniform.

Looks like mustard and
ketchup had a fight

and everyone lost.

What up, B-nard?
You look even paler here.

And you look perfect here.

Now, something to wear
for tomorrow's luncheon.

One of your grandmother's Chanel suits.

Here's her guest list.

I'm afraid only one guest RSVP'd "yes."

All the rest of her
friends RSVP'd "dead."

Bernard, I really do wish I could give

my Grammy what she wants,
but I don't have the money

for a real fancy luncheon.

Or even real milk, for that matter.

We drink "milk drink."

I don't think she can take
much more disappointment.

This morning I had to tell her all about

her favorite athlete, Bruce Jenner.

This is so sad.

Grammy's whole world is gone

and she has no idea.

Max, I have to give her the
one thing that she wants.

A major rollback on civil rights?

No, the luncheon.

She deserves one last hurrah

before I tell her she's lost everything.

I wish someone had done that for me

before my life came crashing down.

Okay, I'll help you.

I mean, Maria will, if she
can find a babysitter.

You are the only person
I'll wear this for.

You know, without the $300 up front.

Thank God Sophie had that maid outfit.

I think this is gonna work.

As long as you don't turn around.

(Astrid) Caroline, is that you?

Oh, she's coming. Quick.

Behind the screen.
Put the suit on over that.

You want me to change into a
Chanel suit behind this screen?

Oh, there's room.
I've done it numerous times.

Oh, did the rest of
our staff arrive yet?

Yes, if you can call them that.

Where did you find them anyway?

Um, around.

Just push me into the room!

I'm doing the best I can!

These pants are five sizes too big!

Bernard, next time,
don't hire a child butler.

And you, don't they have
wheelchairs in China?

I'm from Korea!

I don't think so.

Tell Caroline she owes me.

Who knows what STD I'm catching
from Oleg's butler costume?

And why does he even have this?

It's from when they play
"Going Downtown Abbey."

Maria, I need help with my hair.

See what you can do.

Um, no, I'm not really good at that.

Maria, just do it. Go.

Okay.

You get one of those, and that was it.

Oh, there's my girl.
You look wonderful.

I forgot how good Chanel
feels against my skin.

It's like coming home,

but the house is made of silk and hope.

How's this? A little too Princess Leia?

On top! I like it up on top.

Whoa!

Whoa, Grammy. Keep it PG.

[elevator dings]

Where am I?

Oh, it's Gertrude Goolsby.

Your first and only guest has arrived.

Astrid! Oh!

Oh, have to... oh.

Sneaks up on you.

Good luck with all this.

I'll be in the kitchen,
studying the Chipotle menu.

For my next job.

Don't you look smashing, Astrid.

I'm assuming. I can't see anymore.

Well, I bet you and Grammy have

a lot of fun stuff to catch up on.

How is Gordon?

He has face cancer.

Or the weather is also a subject.

We'd like the first course, pronto.

Maria! Look alive.

You're one to talk.

[bell dinging]

And she gets one of
those and that was it.

Dear, may I ask you a question?

Where am I?

Oh, and where is our sommelier?

At your service.

Some wine?

Um...

My bad. This one's empty.

I got bored.

And what about you, ma'am?

White, red,

or maybe you prefer a chocolate brown?

I must be in New Orleans.

Here we go.

It's from the Bordeaux region.

More like the Costco region.

Maria!

That's me.

Why are these forks not
laid out correctly?

Maria, forks, now.

Glad you like that outfit,

'cause you're gonna be buried in it.

I think I'm gonna let this
one breathe in the kitchen.

Caroline, I'd like to meet the chef.

Oh, of course. Chef!

Booyah!

I'm Chef Oleg.

Gordon Ramsay once put
me in a headlock.

Please enjoy the first course
of my first course:

a tasty tortellini.

Caroline, this sauce is delicious!

Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

This is the kind of luncheon
that makes you feel

like you can handle
anything that comes along.

Pity there aren't more
guests to enjoy it.

[elevator dings]

[posh accent] Darling!

Well, I hope I'm not
late for the luncheon!

Mmm!

[posh accent] This crème
brûlée is just divine!

Don't mind if I don't mind.

[normal voice] Uh, excuse me.
I have to tinkle.

Where's your john?

Oh, I forgot!

Yes, um...

[posh accent] Pardon me, yes.

Could you direct me to your...

Jonathan?

Astrid, darling,

I wasn't sure what to expect
from one of your lunches,

you know, since the scandal,

since you lost all of your...

Gah!

I mean, uh...

Lunch is over. Gertrude is leaving.

Scandal? What scandal?

Oh, you know.

The horror of you not having any more...

Mayday! Double dingle!

Maria, do something.

(Gertrude) Oh.

So you mean she doesn't
want to talk about the fact

that she's lost all her mon...

[glass shatters]

Oh, it's crystal that broke.

I thought it was one of Astrid's bones.

I'll replace it. I mean, I can't,

but it's the right thing
to say right now.

Maria, that's my good crystal.

And it's not replaceable, unlike you.

- Now go!
- Fine.

I'll go. To wherever Maria lives.

But just know your granddaughter

worked really hard to
make this lunch all nice.

No, you don't have to go.

Oh, can I go?

Maybe I should go too.

Would anyone buy that I had plans?

No one is going.

I'm just gonna pick
up the broken crystal

and we'll just continue to
have the best luncheon ever.

Caroline! Let the help do that.

Get up off of that floor!

You are not one of them.

Actually, yes, I am.

Grammy, you may have been in a coma,

but I feel like it's
me that just woke up.

For the past five years,

I have been really missing all of this,

but it's not good crystal
that makes a life.

It's good people. People like them.

And they are not "the help,"

but they did come here to help me.

'Cause you and I might be related,

but these people are my family now.

And also, I should tell you,

I don't work on Wall Street.

I work in Brooklyn, in a diner.

See? I'm a waitress.

That's debatable.

I don't understand.

You're a Channing. How
could you be a waitress?

Because she lost all her money

when you lost all your money.

[heart monitor beats faster]

- Caroline, what is she saying?
- Nothing, she's saying nothing.

I'm saying,

you're poor.

[heart monitor beats increase]

[gasping]

[heart monitor flatlines]

Oh, I leave for two minutes

and the party really goes downhill!

I'm sorry again about
your grandma, darlin'.

Thanks, Earl.

Well, she did die doing what she loved:

being rich and yelling at the help.

[crying]

I'm gonna miss her so much!

Sophie, you knew her for three courses.

I know; I didn't win that Polish
daytime Emmy for nothing!

You know, Caroline,
you did the right thing

throwing that luncheon.

And I pulled a glute

pushing your lovely
racist grandmother around.

I really appreciate you guys
helping me with the luncheon.

And, Oleg, I tried the
food, and it wasn't gross.

You hear that, Han? Wasn't. Gross.

After being a servant for a few hours,

I get how much you all
have to put up with.

So, I'm giving you all a raise!

Thank you so much, Han!

Everyone?

They don't need drug money for a baby.

No, but we need drug money
for a 27-year-old woman.

Welcome to the Williamsburg
Diner Awards Night!

And here's your host,
Neil Patrick Hairless!

This is the night
where everyone is recognized

for their, well...
let's call it work.

Nice suit, Han.

I loved you in The Penguins
of Madagascar.

Here we go.
The award for

Worst Excuse for Being
Late to Work goes to...

Earl, for:
"I died."

It was true.

I was dead
for a full 60 seconds.

And the Foreign Film Award
goes to...

Oleg, for always being
covered in a foreign film.

Yeah. I have so many
bacteria to thank...

but a special shout-out
to streptococcus!

And the winner for Best Lie
Told to Get a Bigger Tip

goes to...

Good luck, girl.

It's an honor to share
this category with you.

It's Max...
for showing customers pictures

of her three small children
on a regular basis.

Wow. Oh!

This award is dedicated
to the lights of my life--

Maxine, Max Jr.,

and Maxi-Pad.

I know only one of you
can see and hear me,

so please tell the others
I...love...you.

And the award for
Best Waitress goes to...

It better not!

Caroline!
- No!

Well, I guess it's true--
women only win awards

when they take on roles
that are humiliating.

And the Best Animated Short
goes to Han Lee!

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

Here's your menu.

I'll be right back
with your water

and a stomach pump.

Keep it.
I know what I want.

Me too.
But it just seems like

Taylor Swift
is never going away.

You're funny. Yeah.
I'm not in the mood for funny.

I will take tomato soup,
house salad,

extra croutons.
And you can charge me extra...

if you have no heart
behind those gazongas.

It's cool.
The guy at the counter

has no teeth,
so you can have his.

Less funny--more salad.
Right?

Maybe the blonde one
should bring it.

Oh, you want her
to bring it?

Maybe clear your calendar.

Uh, the lady in the booth
doesn't like my attitude

and wants you,
so I guess what I'm saying is

I still got it!

Wait, a customer asked for me
and didn't follow it with,

"I'd also like to see
the manager"?

That's a first for me!

Yo, blondie!

Croutons!

[ding ding]

Pick up.
Tomato soup, house salad.

And I'm also running
a special on D batteries.

Buy both, and I'll thrown in
this bootleg copy

of Horrible Bosses II.

Here comes
Horrible Bosses Too Small.

Need some new batteries
to keep walking and talking?

No, Max, I'm not powered
by double Ds like you.

Preach.

Don't buy batteries
from that guy

unless you want your heart
to stop on the bus.

Oleg, this is supposed
to have extra croutons.

It's for my regular.

Yeah, you heard me.
It happened.

Oh, no, "Extra Croutons"
is here again?

Make sure you charge her
extra.

I'm not made of stale bread!

No, you're made of
Legos, right?

We are not charging her extra.

She looks like
she can't afford it.

If she could,
why would she be eating here?

Well, don't judge
a book by its cover.

People look at me and--
Think you're bad in bed?

What's your point?

For your information, Max,
I'm not bad in bed.

In fact, I'm quite the stud
in my Sims community.

You wouldn't be a stud
in a retirement community.

[bell dings]

Hi!
Here's your salad...

Uh...five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

Uh, continue.

And I wanted to introduce
myself.

I'm Caroline,
you're regular waitress.

Ah.

Oh! My turn.
Sorry.

I live alone,
and my plants aren't this needy.

I'm Nola.

And this is Max.
Max, this is Nola.

'Sup, Lola?

It's Nola.

See, this is why
I like the blonde one.

She listens.

May I please have
a cheesecake?

Sure. And thank you, Nola.

I think it's important
to listen to people.

Coming right back
with that cherry pie.

I'll tell her if she
ever stops listening.

I think Nola knows
I'm more than just a waitress.

She can see
right through this uniform.

And so can I...
in just the right light.

Close the door!
- Oh, my God!

Sophie, you scared me!

You're scared?

I just saw the expiration
date on this milk!

Come on, close it,
quick!

I'm in here hiding
from Oleg.

If you wanna get away
from Oleg,

just go anywhere
they sell floss.

I think that Oleg
is cheating on me.

Look.
- Oh, God!

Now she's gonna start
whipping it out?

Look...

He has a second
secret phone.

It's a boner phone.

You mean a burner phone.

Same thing.

Sophie, how do you know

he just doesn't use it
for long distance or...

Or for the woman
that I'm calling right now?

Oh, put her on speaker.

I've nothing else to do.
I'm at work.

(woman)
Da? Oleg?

[grunts hoarsely]
Uh...ah...

(woman)
Oleg?

[hoarsely]
Uhh...ah!

That...
is a terrible Oleg.

He is not that articulate.

[woman speaking in Russian]

Hah! That old whore!

What did she say?

I have no idea!

I don't speak Russian,
but...

I do speak "old whore."

Tell me,
what is his problem?

He has a sweet,
young filly like me at home

and he needs to go out
and plow

some old Russian field?

Well...I'd ask what
you three are doing in here,

but it's never gonna top

what I'm imagining
you're doing in here.

I can't believe
Nola didn't come in tonight.

This is exactly what happened
with my Starbucks barista guy.

One minute, he's suggestively
arranging the bananas at me,

and then next minute,
he's face-down,

dead in a puddle
of soy milk.

Max, what if something
happened to her?

More croutons for us!

She said, "I'll see you
tomorrow."

That doesn't mean anything.
It's just an expression

like, "Employees
must wash hands."

Or...
or, "The baby is yours."

Hey, everybody!

Oh, Sophie,
it's just you.

You're poor!

And now we're even.

Look, I stole it again.
Where's Oleg?

I'll tell you
where he's not--

Culinary school.

He's on break.

Oh, she's gonna be sorry!

Oh...no one comes between
Sophie and her man.

You know...unless
we pay them to.

Couple things--

A--does anyone
ever work here?

Caroline, stop worrying.
Extra Croutons is fine.

She just called to order
some diner food to be delivered.

Oh! So she wants to die
at home.

I said we don't do deliveries.

I told her you two
can barely get the food

from the window
to the tables!

Max, I had to stop by

and bring Nola her salad
and croutons.

I mean, she's kind of
my biggest fan right now.

True...'cause you just
lost me.

I know you think
this is crazy,

but there's something about
the way Nola looks at me.

It's like she's seeing
something in me.

The woman wears
two pairs of glasses.

To her, you're just a chatty
yellow and orange blur.

I was told
you didn't deliver.

By who,
her old boyfriends?

Are you two
gonna kill me or something?

Because if you are,

I would like to put on
a different hat.

No, no, no.
She got worried.

See, you're her first
regular.

I'm just here
for the story.

I figured there'd be something
freaky behind this door

like a 50-foot python
and what's left of the UPS guy.

And Earl guessed
you were a man.

No man.

No, just me in here with
my vagina and my photographs.

Oh! You're a photographer?

I love photography!

And I love privacy.

And I love pot.

Oh, I thought
we were going around.

Come on.
You better come in too.

You're the Yin
to her Yap.

Hey, careful
where you step.

I can't find
my third pair of glasses.

It's on top of your hat.
No, that's my fourth pair.

Hey!

This is Billy the bum!

He used to live in a box around
the corner from my apartment.

He even let me stay over once

when I had to get away
from this bad roommate.

Oh, the one before me?
No, it was you.

You two are a riot
together.

You remind me of me
and my old photographer friend

Annie Leibovitz.

Course,
this was before...

Before she got famous?

No.
Before she hit on me.

I told her
I wasn't into girls.

But...I think she was
confused by the derby.

Yeah. I think we're all
a little confused by it.

Nola, I want to ask you
if you've ever had any success,

but I don't know how to
do that without insulting you.

That's correct.
You don't.

Oh! You're having
a gallery show in SoHo?

Good-bye.

Uh, it was nice
of you two

to, uh, come over,
check on me.

Uh...weird, but nice.

Perhaps we could come
to the opening.

Oh. Oh, you don't
need to do that.

I know we don't need to,

but maybe I want to support
you and your amazing work.

And Max would enjoy.
the free wine.
- Yes, I would.

[laughs]
No.

Oh, I would.

No as in, "No, don't come."

Now,
if you'll excuse me,

I wanna eat my croutons

without the vaudeville
stylings

of Shecky and Nosy.

Here.

Oh, yeah, good.
I was looking for this.

I can't believe
you're doing all this

for a diner regular.

I haven't seen you
this desperate since Monday,

Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday.

I know--on the weekends,
I just give up.

Look that title!

"The Great Unwashed."

Are Oleg's balls here?

Max, it's the "art scene."

Class it up.
At least say testicles.

Evening, ladies.

Earl, what are you
doing here?

And, Han, your sweater's
eating your head.

I'm here for the champagne

and because I couldn't
find my way out.

I just walked into
a picture of a door.

Some of these are going
for thousands of dollars!

That Nola bitch is rich,
and I bet she has

a frigging summer house
made out of my free croutons!

Han, it's the art scene.
Class it up.

At least say "freaking."
Also, "testicles."

Well, I'm not wasting
this new turtleneck on you two.

I'm going to go mingle.

A high fashion model
was giving me the eye.

Then she'd have to be
high.

Uh, Han, I believe
I'll stay here.

Nobody wins with a Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle

as a wingman.

Oh, hey, everybody.

Hey, Sophie.
Hey, Oleg.

So can I class it
back down now?

Sorry we're late.
I was just over there

admiring the photo of the happy
couple under the bridge.

Happy couple?
Sophie, they're two junkies

sharing a needle.

Yeah, well,

at least the lady junkie
knows where his needle's been.

I don't even think
she knows her name.

Well, she knows more
than she's letting on.

She knows everything.

Hey, you guys have
been here a while.

Where's the best place
to steal some food?

Max!
- Sorry, sorry.

Classing it up:
Testicles some food?

Oh, Max, I can tell
by your sassy demeanor

you haven't seen
your photo yet.

What photo? I haven't
bounced any checks here.

Yep, that's me, all right.

I recognize
that "I don't care" pout

and the Thousand Island
dressing in my hair.

Max, just because
you're hanging on a wall

among the poorest,
most lost souls in our city

doesn't mean
that your life is...

I'm hanging
right behind me, aren't I?

Oh, my God!

It could be worse.
You could be naked.

This is worse
than being naked!

I'm wearing polyester!

It's bad enough
I'm a waitress in Brooklyn.

Now I'm a waitress
in Manhattan,

and these guys
didn't even tip!

No, no, no, it's a photograph,

so it's more symbolic.

It's called "Waitress"

and I'm holding
a check pad.

What do all these
blue dots mean?

Is my picture in trouble?

That's how many times
your print has been purchased.

Over here, Max,
away from that

pathetic blonde lady
in the waitress uniform.

Will you relax?
No one even recognized you.

No one?
What about that art critic

who said that
"my smile on the photo

"was a study of tragic,
foolish optimism

in a hopeless,
dead-end life"?

Oh, him.

"Hopeless, dead-end life"?

And then worse,
no one buys me?

I'm not even a success
as a failure?

You're totally
a success as a failure.

Then where are all
the blue dots, Max?

15 people bought you.

Whatever you do,
don't turn around.

Look at these dots!

I am going home
with all these people--

men, women, black, white.

It's like a key party
at Joe Namath's house

in the '70s.

Hey, Shecky!

Why are you putting a dot
by your friend's photo?

Uh, how many extra croutons
can you buy

with the buttload of money
you're making from these photos?

A buttload.
Okay, Okay.

I get it, you're mad.
Tell you what.

I will give you
a free print of your photo.

Look, keep the photo.

I don't want a picture
of me marrying ketchups.

I don't want a picture of me
marrying anybody.

But you can pay me back
another way.

I told you,
I'm not a lesbian.

I just wear hats.

Your friend says
you hate your photo.

No.

I enjoy being
secretly photographed

while I'm stealing someone
extra, extra croutons.

For the record,

I never saw your smile
as foolish.

I saw it as, uh...

just a little big.

Uh--I'm trying to
pay you a compliment.

Well, you failed.

All this time,
when you looked at me,

I thought you saw
something special,

but all you really saw was
someone reading the specials.

I have a question
for you.

Okay, fine.
I wear the derby

because I have a little
bit of a bald spot.

Why didn't I sell?

The picture sucks.

One of my worst.

If you're still trying
to give me a compliment,

you're still failing.

Look, a good photograph

captures the truth.

And I guess
no one really believes

you as a waitress.

That is the single nicest
thing anyone's ever said to me.

So it's not where
you wanna be--I get it.

Look, it's taken me 50 years
to be where I am.

And you are still
so young.

That is
the second-nicest thing

anyone's ever said to me!

The road is long,
and trust me,

it can be really hard.

So whatever you do,

you hold on to that
foolishly hopeful smile.

And...your funny friend.

Yes?
- Yes.

Uh, everyone,
tonight we are witness

to the amazing work

of Nola Anderz.

[applause]

Why don't we all
just stand here quietly

for a moment
and let Nola's pictures speak.

[cell phone ringing]

That's my phone.
Where is it?

[ringing]

Baby, why is my phone
in your bra?

Shh, please!

It's your secret phone!
I know all about it.

[ringing]
- You took it?
Give it to me.

Who is she, Oleg?
Who is this skanky old whore?

Security!
Security!

What--no, no, no!
Stop, stop--she has my phone.

It's his boner phone,
everybody!

It's his boner phone!

And you had the testicles
to think

I was gonna embarrass you.

Hey, Sophie.

Hey, girls.

Did you hear that?

It sounds a little
bit like...I don't know.

The sound of cheating.

You guys
haven't made up yet?

Don't make up here.

No. I slept
on the couch.

I missed her so much,
I watched a romcom

while eating a whole box
of her edible underwear.

Still not talking to me,
Sophie?

For the last time,
there's nobody else but you.

I use that phone...
Yes?

to...
Go on.

I use it to call...
Cut to the chase!

My mother.

Is there no one
he won't sleep with?

I didn't tell you because

I didn't want you to think
I was a mama's boy.

Except when we play
"Mama and Boy."

Well...

I'll tell you
what I told that girl

at the Yankee Candle store.

"I'm not buyin' it!"

It's true, Sophie.

I'm afraid I'm...
losing my hair.

Oh...Oleg.

But don't you know...

I mean, you could be
balder than Jeremy Piven was

15 years ago,
and I'd still love ya.

[phone ringing]

Where's my--
[ringing]

Busted.

Caroline,
I have something for you.

I'm not signing
another one of those

giant birthday cards
again.

It's my picture.

Great. Now I have two of you
that don't wait on tables.

"Thanks for the croutons.
Nola."

Max, where are we
gonna hang me?

Maybe you should hang yourself
in the bathroom

like I thought you would
three years ago.

Yep. I lost $20 on that bet.

You know, Max,

maybe I have to stop running
away from this part of my life

and embrace it,
see it as part of my journey,

my...beautiful,
exciting journey.

If you don't shut up,
I'm gonna hang you right here.

[cha-ching]

Welcome to the Williamsburg Diner,

my name is Max 'cause the hospital
wouldn't le my mother name oops.

I've been out of town on summer,
anything new?

Anything new? Let's see, well...

Facebook went public and **** pirvet.

Kim ans Kanye had a baby,

so now there's another Kardashian
to not keep up with.

Paula Deen is out, gay marriage is in,

and a teacher in California's out
for letting her students get it in.

Justin Bieber got a hit-and-run,
Chris Brown got a hit-and-run,

Rihanna got a hot and still didn't run.

Oprah gave Lindsay $2 million, cunnilingus
gave Michael Douglas throat cancer,

and Michael Douglas gave guys everywhere
another excuse not to do that.

Eygept went crazy,
*** went crazeyer,

and the NSA checks our phone
like a creazy ex-girlfriend.

And Texs hates women,
*** hates blak,

And everybody hates everything
with the exception

of Angelina Jolie,
who is totally awesome.

I meant on the menu.
Anything new on the menu?

I have no idea. Let me check.

Hey, Caroline, anything new
I should know about?

The royal baby
smiled at the queen.

I meant at the diner.

I think we're maybe

washing the forks now?
Let me check.

See, Max, one quick change,

and we went from polyester and
pitiful to powerful and proud.

Just like superman.

Except that superman changed
in a phone booth,

not a stall that says,
"for a good time, call Max."

Well, if you hava problem
with it, why did you write it?

'Cause I didn't have
enough eyeliner to write,

"for an interesting time,
call Caroline."

Look.
Look, Earl, we're wearing

our "Max's homemade cupcakes"
t-shirts again.

See the logo?

Well, actually, I try never

to look you ladies
in the "chestal" area.

It keeps things
on the up and up.

Earl, you are
one in a million, literally,

'cause 999,999 men have only
looked me in that area.

Well, I got to go home.

I missed so much
growing up in Korea.

What, like puberty?

Max, in my count
I'm avere height.

And in my mind,
I'm still rich,

anmy health care plan
isn't flintstones chewables.

So who wants to go in the back

and see how amazing
our brand-new cupcake shop is?

Bring down the enthusiasm,
rachael ray.

Right,
we're not supposed to get

all excited
out this opening tonight.

Last time, we made a big deal,
and the shop didn't do so well.

Ha!
That's like saying the people

near the nuclear explosion
didn't do so well.

Girls,
I am so proud of you two,

getting back up on that horse.

After my first jazz record
didn't sell,

I turned to a life of drinks,
drugs, and loose women.

Funny how sometimes
things just work out right.

But how can you be opening
your cupcake window right now?

It's 2:00 A.M.
our hours are 2:00 to 4:00.

We're targeting
the "post bars" demographic.

Drunk williamsburg guys.

That's my target
when I'm by myself

and now my target
at the new shop.

Funny how sometimes
things just work out right.

We have no big expectations
about the opening tonight.

It's a soft opening.

What's the difference

between a soft one
and a hard one?

You want me to show him?

Thanks, but we're cool.

Seriously,
it won't take me a minute.

It's fine, Oleg.

Just so you know,
I'm already there.

Get ready, this room's had
an amazing transformation.

- Rachael ray?
- I mean, it's fine, whatever.

Han, before we go in,
close your eyes.

I want you to get
the full effect.

Yeah, and I want to trip you.

- She's kidding.
- No, she's not.

Yeah, I'm not.

Han, I promise,
I won't let her trip you.

Now, close your eyes.

- What?
- Now, I thought

she was going to hit me.

- She was not.
- Yeah, I was.

Okay, no more blind eye
bull crap.

Just show me
the damn smelly back room.

Let me turn off the lights
for a more dramatic impact.

What? I didn't do anything.

It was me.

He now knows what hard is.

I cannot believe my eyes.

I felt the same way
when I first saw you.

Original tan, original tile,
original too.

What do you think, Oleg?

Nice.

"Nice"? All you got is "nice?"

This place was like
Great Adventure for rats!

They were waiting in line
to bite us.

Caroline, show them
your bite marks.

- I'd rather Not.
- Nice?

It used to smell like the place
poop comes to die.

Or death comes to poop.

And look what we did!
We created

the grtest, coolest, chic-est
cupcake shop, and I love it!

But you know, no ehusiasm.
Just aoft opening.

And, han,
this was all possible

because you gave us
the space rent-free.

Rent-free?
Now, refre my memory.

When exactly did I say
"rent-free?"

On the 27th, 4:15 P.M.,
you said,

"I don't care about that dump,
you can have it for free.

Burn it to the grod,
for all I care."

I knew learning English would
come back to bite me in the ass.

Soone's already knocking?
That's a really great sign, Max.

Time to open.

Look, girls, I'm blowing
this party horn for you.

Thanks, soie, but we didt
wanto make a big deal,

it's a soft opening.

I love a soft opening.

- Hello, Sophie.
- Hello, leg.

Sorry, shie, about this
uncomfortabl meeting.

If ww had known
you were going to suprise us,

- we weouldn't have invited Oleg.
- Yeah, I was there

when you two broke up and
I'm still suffering from PTSD.

"Post-traumatic Sophie drama."

There's no drama.

And the ard
for the best drama goes to.

Not us. Right, Oleg?

Yes, we're friends now.

See, girls, I cheated on her,

so she smashed in
my car windows.

And my apartment wdows.

And your streo
and your flat screen.

And my brother's flat screen
and his daughter's computer.

Ye, she surprised me.
She wasn't suppose to be home.

We got it out of our sysms.
Good night, friend.

Good night, friend

and, Oleg?

Wow.

That is one lucky horn.

Honey, ook.
Look, some customers.

Hey, cool guys!

Come over here and eat something
from the girls' soft opening!

That is so not
the way I would've gone,

but I' take it

Hello, hello.

What have we got he?

Welcome to Max
homemade cupcakes.

In england wcall 'em
"fairy cakes."

Fay cakes? Mn it.

Why are the hot ones
always gay?

Give us the whole lot.

My God!

A black american exprearss card?

I haven't held a black one
in my hands in years.

I would've guessed you hadn't
held a black one ever.

Sorry, it's our first nigh,
cash only.

Wow.
He is really out of it.

- What is he on?
- Besides me later?

Do not know, but am jealous.

Annow I'really jeaus.

Re he'll be fine.

I'd say
he's more than fine.

I'd say he's
my next boyfriend.

Rond, mate. Wake up.

He's not breathing.

I can't wake him, call 911!

Call 911!

Let's all just calm down. I
have seen this happen a lot.

One summer I had a part-time job,
I was a life guars at a crack hous.

***

he's dead.

Called that wrong.

Max, the guy who died
in front of our shop last night

was a rock star.

He used to date Kate moss.

No offense,
but dating Kate moss

is like a law in england.

Everyone has to do it
when they turn 21.

His name was Roland Glass,
and he has two gold records.

I can't believe
I've never heard of him.

I can.

Your go-to jam
ishe soundtrack from newsies.

Yesterday a rock star,
antoday he's gone.

You never know.

From the fancy breakfast place
on the corner.

You ordered
fromagna cum latte?

One, I wish I had a gun.

And, two, someday I'm gonna
order breakfasto be delivered

with one
of their fancy-a croissants.

Who knows, tonight
I could too much heroin

and e an unexpected ath.

But at least then I'd e
doing something my motr loved.

You're right, Max.
You ly live once.

Yolo.

And you only live till
the next timyou say "yolo."

No. More bad news.

According to my Google alert
for Max's homede cupcakes-

you have a Google alert
for our business?

I only have a Google alert
for "Oprah goes topless."

I'm not saying
it's gonna happen,

but I'm saying, if it does, I'm
gonna be the first oneo know.

Look, it's online that roland
glass died in front of our shop.

And now my phone just died.
It's an epidemic.

Oleg, what are you still doing
with the aow from our sh?

Ght you said that was hung.

, I said I was hung.

And I can't put it up now

wi that crowd of people
in front of your window.

There are people
in front of our window?

Dude, is this
where my manoland died?

Yeahright ov there

then I'm gonna put thihere
nexto Paddington bear.

I caught this at h last coert.

And I also caught this.

So, like, whatdude?
Just dropped to the ground?

Actually, he h right here
first, smiled, then fell.

He sled? Dude.

Max, c I see you over he?

Soy for your I and dope hat.

Thanks.
I found it in a dumper.

Max, what are you ing?

N't tell them
he hit our cnter.

We neeto distance ouelves
om the entire event.

This spes disaster
for our new business.

Dude, can I t
three dozen cupcakes?

T spells succe.

I have beaucoup friends cong
here for the midnight vigi

how mu a your cupcakes?

$7.

That's a lot.

Dude. Roland would've
wantedat way.

And he hit right here
before he fell.

And as he fell,
he looked up at me and smiled.

Content. Peaceful.

That'll be $7, cash only.

Mira, can you break a 50?

Max!

Yeah, what do you need?

Change for a 50.

Got it. I mean, why, God, why?

Max, we're almost
sold out in here.

I need more cupcakes
from the kitchen.

Got it. I'll come right in.

Earl?

Yo!

Same split as before.
30¢ on every dollar you sell.

What a waste.

You know how much money
we could make if we sold pot?

You want in on that too?
Same split.

Man,
that hippie patchouli smell

is worse than the poop was.

Han, shh. These people are
in mourning. Show some respect.

Me? Me show some respect?

What will you two do next,

sell cupcakes
at the diabetes wing

at the children's hospital?

How dare
you doubt my sincerity?

I personally have shooed
a homeless man

away from peeing
on that shrine twice.

I don't care what
I may or may not have said

on the 27th at 4:15 P.M.

Your business is booming,
and now I want rent.

No way, han. That man
could've overdosed anywhere.

But God made him overdose in
front of our window as a gift.

And, yes, we are accepting that
gift because you only live once.

Yolo.

This isn't "yolo""
it's "hodo""

he only died once.

I'm surprised you aren't
selling "hodo" t-shirts.

How dare you again?

We are simply providing
some comfort food

to people who need comfort.

And, I might add, we are doing
it with the utmost respect.

That's it,
your business is booming,

I want rent. 200.

A year?

A month, and it's a bargain
for my beautiful space.

This space is only beautiful
because we made it beautiful.

Yeah, show 'em
your bite marks!

Max, I'd rather not.

You will pay me $200 a month,

and there is nothing
you can do to change my mind!

Show him your bite marks!
Fine!

A rat bit her ass?

Okay, 195.

No rent, han. That wasn't
the deal you made us.

This is not personal,
it's business.

I want a slice of grief pie!

Show him your front bites!

No! That's too personal.

Sorry you had to do that.
So am I.

It's healing nicely.
Don't lie to me.

I think it's nice of uto add
our owers to the others.

Shows respect.

You're acting
like you didn't steal them.

X, it's the thought
that counts.

And I thought it'd be chper

to pull them out
of someone's garn.

Wait, where's the shri?

Look, han ved it
over to the dineor.

That insolent charlatan!

Whatever that means.

Can you believe this, girls?

He's casng in a death.

Without us.

And in his honor
tonight we a serving

chicken LA roland!

At a mrner's discount
of just $8.95.

Looks like jiminy icket
turned to the rk side.

I Al have rock stapudding.

Nope. No way, Max.
Th is our shrine.

Grab aandful of bears.

We'rmoving
the dead g sine back?

Wa, let me just
light a candle for my digny.

It died here t.

Max, o you wa
to be ccessful or not?

Because if youo,
grab o of these poems

that doesn't follow
any of the rules of poetry,

and move it back
to the ccake window.

Because this is our death.

Think e
you're being a little rsh.

"Rock out in heaven.
Love, Kevin."

That'sold.

Oops, knocked over a cdle.
Ooh, ll fire.

Fire on shoe.

If I don't get this out, it's
gonna be my memorial service.

Look, look.

Those girls e disrting
the shrine oa dead m!

Lo, look, a roach got out
of the diner! Quick, step on it!

Look, hippies, look!
Put down those bongs and look.

They're ving the place
where a man died

fothr own financial gain!

Hey, that's so not ol, man.

Yeah, me on. Yeahboo!

He's the not cool one.
Yeahlook at him!

Roland glass died hrible death

in front
of our adorable cupcake window.

See? "Horrible, adorable"?

That rhyme just me
right off the top of my head.

Hey! Hi.

Hi. He knows!

I told him to op
peeing on the shrine

when it was still overhere!

Isn't that right?

P. That's e bih.

Yes! Yes! I'm the bitch!

So n cool, dude.
Let's gehim out of her

(Han no! Stop!

That's my wa!

Ooh, stop!
That's not my wallet

op!

Stop

st of rock of ages, stop!

Puhim wn. He's cool.

Even with thothes
and that head.

I mean, really. E we
that desperate f success?

We'det hane torn apart?

I'thinking.

Caroline-

Max, I'm thinking.

Well, no one's knock, knock,
ocking on our door now.

'S more deadut tre

than when ere was
a dead guy out the.

I'm having second thoughts
about how behav today.

I mean, how could we
have let hanive?

Hello.

I brought you some rock star
pudding to sayhankou.

Rock star pudding.
What's in it, pills?

Oken dreams?
Tear-stained panties?

Caroline?

I'm Noas easy as Max.

Said every gir
my seventh grade class.

Look, I was wrong.

No, han, I was.

We should pay rent.

I wasn't talking
about the rent.

Rent?
O said anything about rent?

I was wrong when I said

it wast personal,
it was business.

After Max stopped me
from being torn

limb from limb
by the smelly hippies,

I realized, with us,
it is mostly personal.

And a little business.

A little business?

What other kind
could you have?

Max, let's not be hard on han.

He's giving us
this space rent-free.

No one said "rent-free."

I came up with a number
I think is fair.

$250,000. Yeah, sounds fair.

I remembered that was
your original cupcake shop goal.

So when you hit that amount,
we can talk rent.

Han, that is so sweet.

And I'm not gonna ruin it
by bringing up the fact

that she just said
"hard on han."

Really, han,
it's so, so generous.

But don't know
if we're comfortable with it

what if we offered y
a small piece of theusiness?

I'll wait for thrent.
You two are good fends.

A woman finally
offers han a piece,

and he turns it down.

Max. Google alert.

Oprah's topless?

Max, let that go.
That's never gonna happen.

Not with that attitude.

No, the autopsy
says roland glass

choked
on a Max's homemade cupcake.

This is a disaster.

Hey, where's your enthusiasm
now, miss rachael ray?

This place is the balls!

And it's just a matter of time

till those sicko hipsters
are lining up

for "one of those cupcakes
that killed that dude""

open the window!
We're back, baby!

But we can't count
on a guy dying every week.

I mean, I have
a positive attitude,

but that's too pollyanna.

We don't have to.

That's what's so great
about this window.

Who knows what'll happen?

Right, and we won't
have to chase business down

because we'll be
right here on the street

waiting for it to come to us.

Max, I feel so good
about the possibilities.

One night it could be
a black American express card,

and the...

Max, is it...

Other nights,
it's a friendly little visit

from our homeless guy.


Care for a cupcake?

Well, our new
outdoor seating area

is about as popular
as Paula Deen at an NBA game.

How much longer do we
have to be out here?

We are cold.

So, so cold.

I can see my breath.

And my boys are up
by my rib cage.

I can smell his breath.

And my boys are up by
where my boys used to be.

And these customers
aren't helping.

How could we have thought
a strong Han presence

would make it more popular?

Max, in hindsight,

it feels like us not springing
for those heat lamps

was a bad call.

Uh, you think?

Guys, I just peed
a little to keep warm.

Well, I peed a little

'cause I had no choice.

Great, they're stuck
to the bench.

Go get the windshield
scraper.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

Reading Us Weekly, Earl?

Ooh, "Stars.
They're just like us."

Well, if they're just like us,
where's the picture

of them turning their
underwear inside out?

Caroline left it
in the men's room.

And as I said
that out loud,

I realized that I must have
been in the ladies' room.

I can't see, Max.

Max, I've got
some exciting news!

Eh, I vowed I'd never get
excited about anything again

after that last
Indiana Jones.

I found us two discount
heat lamps on Sherry's list.

It's like Craigslist, but
without the high probability

of being murdered by
a deranged medical student.

And about those lamps?

Uh, no.

We can't worry about
our outdoor business.

We barely have
an indoor business.

And we never will,
with that attitude.

I'm gonna ask you
one more time:

please listen to those
Tony Robbins tapes

we found in the garbage.

Well, girls,

tomorrow's the day
I've been looking forward to

for three years.

You're getting your
teeth cleaned?

Sorry, that's what's we've
been looking forward to.

I'm moving in
with Sophie.

From now on, the booty call is
coming from inside the house.

I couldn't help
but overhear.

From way back there?

Your ears should give a pep talk
to the other parts of your body.

And, Oleg, if you need
any help with the move,

might I offer
my services?

My trainer Skylar says
I'm getting ripped.

Yeah, ripped off
by Skylar.

Thanks, Han.

And as a bit of a payback,

I'll wash my hands
back here tonight.

See you later, neighbors.

Oleg's moving in?

This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

And I lost $2 billion.

What is the problem?
This is all good news.

Sophie an Oleg
are in love.

Yeah!

And they'll be in love

on our stairs,

in our hallway,

and on every surface
of the laundry room.

What do you know about love
anyway, Christian Single?

I know Jesus
has a girl for me.

He has to.

I'm $400 deep into
that damn website.

Look, we just make a pact

that no matter
what happens upstairs,

or on the stairs
or in the laundry room,

we don't invite it
into our apartment.

Hey, everybody!

Oh! Brr!

It's raining cats
and goats out there.

Don't you mean
"cats and dogs"?

Oh, it's so nice to be corrected
as you walk in the door.

Hey, baby.

Can you believe in 24 hours
we'll be living in sin?

Oh, don't worry.

My parents don't know.

I'm having a dinner party
tomorrow night to celebrate.

And also because I have
15 pounds of beef

that's about to go bad.

So, Max, Caroline,
are you in?

Actually, Sophie,
we're busy--

We'll be there.

If there's beef involved,
I'm involved.

What happened to the pact
we just made?

I hate to tell you this--

if it comes down
to you or beef,

I'm always going beef.

[baby cries]

[laughs]

That was Sherry
from Sherry's list.

She makes you
call her that.

She said she's consider
charging us $150

if we pick up the heat
lamps themselves.

And I'm charging you with
three counts of interrupting

this "Baby in a Faulty
High Chair" video.

[thudding]

[Oleg groans]

[laughs]
Someone fell in real life!

(Oleg)
You told me you had it.

(Han)
I said I didn't have it.

It's Oleg and Han
moving in.

Get away from the door!

Han will see your feet
under the door.

They're right at
his eye level.

This is like a horror movie--
Saw III.

Because when Han bent over,

I saw 3 inches
of his crack.

So you saw
his whole crack?

[pounding on door]

Step away!

(Oleg)
Open the door, Max.

I'm about to kill Han,

and I know you're
gonna want to see that.

Damn it!
He's right.

Cute outfit, Han.

Like one of those
male strippers

from "No Thunder
From Down Under."

This is so heavy.

Oleg, what do you
have in here?

Socks!

Really, Han,

It's like your arms are
only there for decoration.

To be fair,
Oleg's socks

probably have some pretty
heavy loads in them.

Oleg, what is all your
junk doing out here?

Do I actually smell
girls screaming?

I bring things up,
Sophie says "No,"

I bring them
right back down.

Is there no elevator
up in this bitch?

Oleg, you forgot
your painting,

and this one's
a definite "No."

Sophie, I haven't
gotten a "Yes" yet,

aside from the quickie we had
up against the bathroom sink.

Not such a quickie.

They locked me out and I had
to eat my lunch in the truck.

Then what was the point
of me renting a moving truck?

I mean, besides the rough sex
we had up against the sides?

They locked me outside on the
side of the road for that one.

Okay, well, we have
to go back in.

See you tonight
at the beef-a-thon.

No, Oleg.

Maybe I'm being unfair.

I mean, you have all
this stuff that you like,

and they have
an apartment.

Put it in there.

Sophie!

I'll see you at 8:00!

So what do you say,
girls?

Absolutely not--

Yes.

Max, there's a method
to my madness.

Oleg, will you
excuse us a second?

And maybe help Han
with that box.

In those shorts, I can actually
see a hernia happening.

I thought we weren't
getting involved!

If we help Oleg out,

he'll let us use
the moving truck

to pick up
our heat lamps.

I already said
"No" to those.

But we just
talked about it!

I wasn't listening!

That baby fell face-down
into mashed potatoes.

But you said "Yes"
to the dinner party,

so if you get your meat,
I get my heat.

Just because you rhyme
doesn't make it okay.

And I'm pretty sure that's what
Rihanna said to Chris Brown.

Where are we meeting this
chick with the heat lamps?

I haven't gone this far
for something I didn't want

since Planned Parenthood
moved to New Jersey.

Hello!

I'm getting
truck sick back here.

You're a worse driver than
people assume I am.

Come on! Come on!

We're gonna be
late to dinner!

Would any of you
be interested in playing

rock-paper-scissors
for a seat up front?

(both)
No!

Girls, can I ask you
a relationship question?

(both)
No!

And besides, what would we
know about relationships?

That's like asking
Donald Trump

for the name
of a good hairstylist.

I mean, what's
the deal with her?

She asks me to move in,

and then won't even
let me have my painting?

I mean, Sophie
already bought the cow.

She might as well
let the cow's crap in.

So you're saying
I'm right.

No, no,
but I do think--

No, you don't think,

or your mouth wouldn't
be moving right now.

I'm just saying,

he has the right
to move some of his stuff

into Sophie's apartment
and out of ours.

Speaking of his stuff,

there's something
in a box back here

is humming, and--
oh, it stopped.

[buzzing]

Oh, it started again.

That's my lifelike mouth
with authentic jaw action.

Oleg,
watch the road!

The last words I hear
can't be "lifelike mouth."

Everything looks
very nice, Sophie.

Yeah, see,

I'm not gonna talk until
the other guests arrive.

I got to save my hostess
sparkle for the real guests.

Hey, baby.

Where the hell
have you been?

That was a pretty
loud sparkle.

It's my fault
we're late, Sophie--

It's okay.
Just sit down.

Don't you want
to know what I was--

No, really.

I got a pot roast over here

that's a hell of a lot
more interesting.

Max, thank God
you're here.

There was so much
awkward silence,

I pretended I got a phone call
from a banana.

I'm gonna take
a quick shower.

Oh, Oleg,
Dinner is ready.

You don't have time
to run down to the "Y" now.

No, I meant I would
shower here.

Here...

In my bathroom?

Uh...

Yeah.

I live here now.

Oh, yeah.

That's right.

Imagine that.

Hey, Oleg, why don't you
just come over here

and sit next to Earl?

Because he's old and I'm sure
his smeller is shot.

Sophie, you really must write
a "how to entertain" book.

Here we go:

Grandma Chinkski's
pot roast.

This looks amazing.

I love a root vegetable
in the winter.

Can it ever just be
about me?

¶ Beef, beef, beef ¶

¶ B-beef, b-beef, beef ¶

What?
That's my beef song.

[glass clinking]

I'd like to make a toast
to Sophie.

Oh, that's sweet.

But not with that glass.

That's Grandma Chinski's
crystal.

Baby, I was in the middle
of a toast.

Oh, I'm sorry, but...

those are my
favorite thing!

Grandma Chinski traded two
of my slow cousins for those.

Well, you know,
it's funny.

I have a favorite thing too.

In fact, why don't I
just go and get it?

[gasps]
I can't believe it.

I'm about to meet
Lon Anderson!

Can someone help me
lift up my fork?

My arms are still
sore from the move.

Open up.

Someone else
has to feed Han.

He just licked
my pinky.

Earl, what are you
doing over there?

Just hanging out
with R&B sensation,

Mary J.-juana.

Oh, good.

So you're in the right mind-set
to hand-feed a 30-year-old man.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

I think that's Polish
for "No."

Uh-huh.
Yes, Sophie.

It's my painting.
Excuse me--our painting.

And it's going up
on our wall.

Is it me,

or is this party
tense as hell?

I don't think Sophie and Oleg
are gonna make it.

Uh-oh. Am I talking
out loud right now?

I told you, I don't want
that thing in here.

I don't understand.
It's just a painting.

What's so bad about it?

Oh, my God.

Nice, huh?

I did it myself.

It's a paint-by-numbers.

You mean
it's a Putin-by-numbers.

Why are his nipples
so big?

They don't seem
that big to me.

Oh, I am too high
for this.

I'm not high enough.

In my culture, big nipples
mean power and wealth.

In our culture,
big nipples means,

"Wears a t-shirt
in the pool."

There.

I like it.

Adds a certain
something to the room.

Every wall needs nipples.

So a guy knows
where to look.

Thank you for telling me
to do this, Caroline.

She did?

I'd get up and run,
but my legs are like taffy.

Seriously,

you told him
to hang that thing up?

In fairness,
I had not seen the painting

when I suggested
something like that.

I mean, I get it.

It's gorgeous.

But it doesn't
go with the décor.

What?

Is it throwing off this
gorgeous outdoor-indoor swing?

I'll cut you with
the carving knife!

Nobody is cutting anyone.

Especially not me.

Do you never learn?

Just put some beef
in your napkin like I did,

and let's get out
of here.

Sophie, you asked me
to move in.

Guess what?
I moved in.

Yes, I asked you
to move in,

but not with big
weird-nipple Putin.

Well, how big are
nipples supposed to be?

'Cause--never mind.

And what's your
problem anyway?

I gave you a drawer.

This!

This is my drawer.

What good is this?

I can't even get one
of my ball gags in there.

You asked for a drawer,
I gave you a drawer!

And who needs
12 ball gags anyway?

Oh, so now
you don't like ball gags?

Who are you, lady?

I'll tell you who I am--

I'm the lady who's "Putin"
this is the trash!

You trash that,
I'll trash this.

Oh, no.

Oh, you think
you're gonna break

one of Grandma Chinski's
glasses?

No, if anyone's gonna break one,
it's gonna be me!

[glass shatters]

This reminds me of the first
half of my second marriage,

and the second half
of my third marriage.

Sophie, I'm done.

And as you said to me
on our first date,

"I don't know how much more
of this I can take."

Fun party.

Not awkward at all.

I should get going though.

Got to be up early for--
what's a thing?

Church?

¶ Beef, beef, beef ¶

¶ B-beef, beef, beef, beef ¶

Sorry about that
dinner party last night.

It kind of got away
from me a little bit.

But I really appreciate
you getting up early

and helping me move
Oleg's stuff back.

I just actually feel like
this is a little bit my fault--

Seriously!

Can it ever just be
about me?

Hey, um,

where are we taking
his stuff anyway?

I don't think Goodwill
will take a love seat

that's actually
covered in love.

Well, I was thinking,

you know,
since Oleg and I

really did have
something special,

I was thinking I would
just take his stuff

and dump it
down by the river.

Okay,
I'm just gonna say it--

Sophie, would it kill you

to just let Oleg
hang the damn painting?

[tires screeching]

[horns honking]

So what,
you just park the truck

in the middle of
the Van Wyck Expressway?

Do you never learn?

I almost ate Rent-A-Truck
floor mat.

Caroline,
you get this straight--

Oleg was wrong.

And those nipples
were way too big.

This is awkward.

You're in the truck?

No, you're in
my apartment.

[tires screeching, thud]

I think something
hit us.

You guys just need
some couples therapy.

I'll mediate it,

since I've had
therapy myself.

Not as a couple,
but hopefully someday.

I'm just sitting here waiting
for the tow truck to come.

How's your neck, Max?

Not so bad.

The second car that hit us
kind of knocked

what the first car knocked
out of place back in place.

I'll start.

This woman is a fraud
and a liar.

(Caroline)
Okay, well,

we need a little more Oprah,
a little less Jerry Springer.

Hey, don't dis Springer.

They have great snacks
in the green room.

You were on Jerry Springer?

Yeah, I was on
"I hate my roommate

and I don't know
how to tell her."

Oleg and I are not gonna
talk this thing out.

If you want
to waste your time,

go teach in an inner city
high school.

You know what?
Even better--

I'll do the talking
for Oleg.

Oh, then, Max--
you be me, okay, Max?

Oh--I don't know if--

Do you want the rest
of the beef, or not?

This guy is a bum,
and the painting has to go.

It's stupid.

Really, really good, Max,

but next time just arch your
back a little, and, yeah.

Yeah.

Okay, you be me.

No, I don't feel like getting a
threatening erection right now.

But I will say, anytime
people move in together,

it's a compromise.

Look at Max--

when I needed a place to stay,
she let me have my horse.

Let me just say--and I
brought this up on Springer--

I only let you in
because of the horse.

And I finally stopped
putting up a fight

and let Max
walk around naked.

When did that happen?

Tomorrow.

Oh, Oleg,

I wouldn't want you to give up
walking around naked.

I mean, as long as you don't
sit down on anything white.

Makes sense.

Nobody likes a chocolate
starfish on an ottoman.

Point, Sophie.

Ha!
I'm winning, everybody!

Well, it's therapy.

There are no
winners and losers.

Sounds like something
a loser would say.

You know, Oleg,

this isn't about that
silly little painting.

It's just, uh,

a lot of change
in a short amount of time...

(whispers)
I'm so scared.

Sophie,

I don't care about my stuff,
as long as I have you.

What did we just do?

We had them apart, and now we
just put them back together.

You did that.

You don't know
when to butt out.

Jerry's words.

[cash register bell dings]

Hey, I'm sleeping
at Deke's house tonight.

Wink, wink, winky-wink.

Deke's house? You mean
your boyfriend's dumpster?

Yeah. So I need a, uh...

Tetanus shot?

Higher standards?

No, a condom.

I'm about to have sex,
and I want it to feel bad.

I should have one in my purse
from the last time I had sex.

They had purses
the last time you had sex?

No, we carried animal hides
tied with sticks.

It hasn't been that long.

Oh, here's one next to this
movie ticket stub from Precious.

Okay, it's been that long.

You saw Precious without a condom?

It says, "Best if used
before September 2012."

Just like the milk here.

I wish I knew a guy with a condom.

A man, any man.

Oleg, do you happen to have...

Okay, this should get you
through the night.

But if it doesn't,

You can use this freezer bag
and a rubber band.

Max, I laid out the little cups,

so all you have to do
is fill them with cole slaw.

Said the girl who was on the
Forbes "top ten to watch" list.

I can't do my side work tonight.

Normally I'd say
it's because I'm drunk,

But tonight it's because
my back hurts and I'm drunk.

Here, babe, I got you something
that might help your back feel better.

A breast reduction?

No!

Why would you spit in the face of God?

Everybody, calm down.
Those aren't going anywhere.

And if they are,
I am going with them.

I got some cooling patches
to soothe her muscles.

And when that doesn't work,

I have another brand
called "maui wowie."

Pickup.

- I'll see you later. Love you.
- Love you.

Deke, breath.
What is that?

Teriyaki beef jerky.
Why, is it bad?

No. Give me another hit.

That is delicious.

You know it.

Max, since you guys are getting serious,
why not go on the pill,

so every night you won't have to play
"What can we turn into a condom?"

The pill is, like, 50 bucks a month.

That's more than it costs
to raise a damn baby.

Well, your boyfriend's rich.
He can afford to pay for it.

Great, now I'm a white trash mom.

Uh-uh, no way.

I'm saving Deke's fortune
for more important things,

like Doritos Dinamita.

Pretty much the filet mignon
of corn chips.

I mean, I'd be on the pill right now,

But the one man interested
in me is married,

so I guess that's more of a bitter pill.

Seriously, Max. Think about it.

Fine. Why don't
guys have to take the pill?

We have to take all the pills.
Birth control, Midol, roofies...

Bonjour, Caroline.

Chef Nicolas.
What are you doing in the diner?

Oh, no, I never wanted you
to see me wearing this.

Yeah, so be a gentleman
and take a step back,

'cause as bad as it looks,
it smells worse.

I think you look beautiful.

Your wife looks beautiful.

Oh, yeah. Get it, girl.

May I see you alone
over there in the, uh...

I guess one would call it a restaurant?

But just for a minute. I'm working.

What's that smell?

That's today's special. Beef pot pie.

Oh, it doesn't smell like beef.

That's because it's not beef,

it's not made today,
and it's not special.

Listen, Caroline.

We have all this relationship drama,

And we're not even in a relationship.

Please get to know me better.

Come to my home for dinner.

Dinner at your home, just you and me?

How do you think your wife
would feel about that?

We have an open relationship.

Did you think I'm the type of man

who would have sex with another
woman without asking my wife?

That is so American.

Max?

Why are you calling Max?

I want to make sure
I haven't lost my mind.

Nicolas said he told his wife about me,

and she gave him permission
for us to sleep together.

Ha! Good one!

My boss at Quiznos once told me
his wife's dying wish

was that I let him motorboat me.

Okay, so she may have been
motorboated out of Quiznos.

But I am not falling for this.

Yes, I thought you wouldn't believe me,

so I set up a Skype call
with her from France on Friday.

Wait, you want me to Skype
with your wife about sex?

Am I on Dr. Phil?

Hey, everybody.

I got a new dress, and it's bitchin'.

Oh.

Hey, look at him. Oh.

Nobody told me they added
beefcake to the menu.

Excuse me, beefcake has been on the menu
since I started working here.

Wow, wow.

Finally...

There's somebody in the diner
as good-looking as me.

Hi, I'm Sophie Kuchenski.

Nicolas Saintcroix.

Ah!

And he's French too?

Oh, come on!

I'm sorry, I was in the middle
of a conversation with Caroline.

Who?

Me, the one whose feet
you're standing on.

Oh.

Oh, wait a minute.

Is this the married guy?

Oh, girl!

I'm gonna give you two days'
head start, and then he's mine!

Why do you care what his wife
thinks about your hair?

You're not gonna be sleeping with her.

Although you'd be a lot
more interesting if you did.

I'm not gonna be
sleeping with him either.

And when I tell his wife that,
I want to look good doing it.

I have to look 20% better than her.

And since Skype makes you
look 20% worse,

I have to look 40% better
than I do now.

You realize talking about math in
a hair salon is my worst nightmare, right?

Welcome to the Tristan Evans salon.

Hi, hello. We're here
for the student haircut.

I'm sorry?

The $6 haircuts for poor people

from the people who don't really
know how to cut hair yet.

Max, that's not true.
This is the Tristan Evans salon.

I'm sure that everyone that's
enrolled here is a genius.

At least tell me they're gay.

Just have a seat over there.

I'll have somebody come up
from the hair school and...

Shh! So loud.

Hair school. Got it.

We'll just take a seat
over there till they arrive.

Girl, you just sit there, relax,

and let Jameis make this head major.

So weird, 'cause I majored in head.

Girl, you are all everything.

Ah...oh!

That's a little cold.

I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

Dan.

Uh-huh. Dan?
So just Dan?

You're not, like,
a Danny or a Dantrell?

Dan.

I need to get conditioner.

Damn it, Max, I got a straight one.

What makes you think
he's straight?

He keeps pushing my head down
before I'm ready.

Is the water too warm?

Why? Are my pants too wet?

Girl, are we in love?

Max, I need you to give me your gay.

Yeah, right.

I'd give you my left nut
before I give you my gay.

You weren't even
gonna get your hair done.

Yeah, but I always wanted to know
what it felt like to get a shampoo

without a school nurse running
that tiny comb through my hair.

Dan?

I have a magazine over there

with a photo of a chic,
piece-y, choppy bob.

You can do that, right?

Sure.

Piece-y bob. Got it.

'sup?

Dan, Dan, Dan!

Okay, done.
You're ready to cut.

Let's go. I can't risk some
discount hetero cutting my hair.

I'll see you at home.
I'm pretty close to a hairgasm.

That should've been mine.

I haven't had a hairgasm in years.

She hasn't had any gasm in years.

Ooh!

Oh, my God!

Max, is that hair
your new form of birth control?

You look like Dame Edna.

That's what I asked for!

Hellooo!

Now my outside matches my inside,

because I've always been
an old drag queen

trapped inside the body
of a young black girl.

Hellooo!

Oh, hi, Max.

Oh, I used to wear my hair like that.

I used it to smuggle cheese
and cigarettes into the prison.

Oh, hey, Caroline.

Just checking.

Still not sleeping with that French guy
that I'm sleeping with?

Still not, Sophie.
He's married.

Well, good.

'cause I'm here to talk to that wife,
and throw my hoo-ha into the ring.

I even bought myself a flat French hat
to make me more French.

Yeah, I got me the hat 'cause I didn't
have time to grow out my pits.

Okay, the call is in one minute.
I'll just do it from here.

I was planning to be holding
my Louis Vuitton shopping bag,

but the cat took a dump in it.

And, Max, bring that lamp
closer to my face,

So I don't have eight Skype chins.

Fine, but if I get too close to
the bulb, my hair might blow up.

Here she is.

Sophie, good-bye.

Oh, no, I'm not leaving, baby.

That French hottie and I
are perfect for each other.

I mean, look at me.

I'm wearing a beret.
I have a baguette.

Bonjour, bitches!

Okay, take a deep breath,
and remember, this is ridiculous.

Bonjour, Caroline.

Bonjour. You must be Juliette.

It is nice to meet you.

And you as well, Juliette.

I just want to set the record
straight about Nicolas and I.

I am not the type of...

Yes, you have my permission
to sleep with Nicolas.

Au revoir.

That's it? She's gone?

I didn't even get to say
"hos before bros" in French.

So much more to say.

What more is there to say?

She said we could sleep with him.

No, I'm never sleeping with Nicolas,
no matter what his wife says.

Good, 'cause you could never
share a French guy.

You won't even share your French toast.

Thanks for coming.

I promise, just one drink at Nicolas's,
and then we'll go to the movies.

And, Max, I can't believe
you went out with that hair in public.

I like it.

You look like my aunt Esther,
but not as hot.

Oh, Caroline.

I see you brought Deke

And Max's mother?

The only thing this hair and my mother
have in common is they're both high.

Nicolas, I'm not staying.

I know you went to a lot
of trouble with dinner,

so I didn't want to be rude, but
we can only stay for one drink.

God, you look beautiful.

Maybe two drinks.

But definitely no dinner.

Well, that dinner we weren't
staying for was delicious.

Yeah, we should not stay more often.

I like your loft, man.

It's the perfect place to live
if you like to commit really sexy crimes.

Well, we should go.

No. You're not staying for dessert?

You're breaking my heart.

Well, maybe just one piece.
We can share it.

I thought you didn't want to share.

He's not married to his dessert, Max,
and it's just one piece.

We're here, so he doesn't get a piece.

You got a pretty sweet setup
for a married man who's single.

Creme caramel au coconut cake.

Well, it's no Fudgie the Whale.

Thanks.

I love to cook for friends.

Beautiful friends.

Nicolas, just because
your wife gave me permission

does not mean I'm gonna
let you take me over

To that king-size bed with what
looks like really good sheets

and make love to me all night long.

And then again that morning.

So how's your back, Esther?

Oh, Morty.

I have to tell you something.

Is it your heart?

No, I'm on the pill.

I know.
You're on a lot of pills.

No, a pill-pill.

The pill-pill-pill?

Yeah, see?

You just pop 'em out one at a time.

They're like pez for sluts.

Speaking of sluts...

Oh, boy, this is awkward.

And I've testified
against half my family.

I agree, Max.
Things are a little uncomfortable.

So why don't we just make this
as weird as possible?

Damn it, I knew he was gonna kill us.

Tango, anyone?

Honestly, I prefer if you kill us.

Okay, well, we gotta go, Esther.

No, Morty, sit down!
I'm not missing the show.

It comes with dinner.

Tango? Nicolas, you cannot be serious.

Oh, maybe you cannot dance,
Caroline?

Can't dance?

One summer, I taught ballroom
dance to homeless teens.

Because when you're dancing,
you're not hungry?

Fast-forward.

This is my least favorite part
of the Addams Family.

- Look at his pants.
- I know.

That tango is giving him
even less ball room.

Stay. We don't have to have sex.

We don't?

I promise.

I have to go to the restroom, Max.
So do you.

Come in, come in,
come in, come in, come in.

Okay, where's the coke?

There is no coke.

Why would you call anyone
into a bathroom if you don't have coke?

That's rude.

No, I was just gonna talk to you.

Oh, then I'm definitely
gonna need coke.

Okay, look.
You are not sleeping with him.

Of course not.

But tonight I'm thinking
there's something special here.

I mean, we talked, and we laughed.

What is this,
"previously on Caroline"?

Hey.

If you guys are doing blow
in here without me,

I'm gonna be so pissed.

I wish.

No, Caroline wants
to have sex with Nicolas.

Even after that tango?

Listen, now I'm thinking I want
to sleep over, but not have sex.

Is that where he puts it in
but doesn't move it around?

That's what I do
when you're passed out.

That's what I do when you're passed out.

Look, nothing is
going in anywhere.

I just want to get to know him better.

You really think you can
sleep in his bed with him,

and not use his penis
as a body pillow?

Of course.

I've done that with every boy
on the upper east side.

That's why they called me
the East Side Snuggler.

And trust me,

even though his wife begged me
to have sex with him,

I'm not going to.

But didn't you tell us the whole
reason you dragged us here

was because you were afraid
of being alone with him?

What is this,
"previously on Caroline"?

Look, I get it.

And if you two really don't think
I'm capable of not having sex with him,

Then hang out for a bit
until you're sure that I'm fine.

Fine, but we are not staying all night.

Here are some blankets for you,
Max and Deke.

You can take the couch.

Caroline and I will take the bed.

Once again, our apologies.

We are just too drunk to go.

Too drunk!

You did share that one glass of wine.

Yup, we are too drunk.

So, too drunk to walk?

Well, I don't know.
You be the judge.

I am so sorry about this.

It's fine, Caroline.

I know what's going on here.

Oh, and, Nicolas, before you go,

I just wanted to say
thanks again for the drinks,

the dinner, the dessert,

my pillow, and Deke's pillow.

We get it, Grandma. Good night.
We'll be right over there.

And I'll be right over here.

Good night, sleep tight, don't let
the bedbugs have sex with you.

Uh, you and I are gonna
do it, right?

Oh, yeah. Think I took
my pill this morning.

Either that or I didn't take my pill.

Wow, Max, this is a big step

that you may or may not
have taken today.

You know if it's too much trouble,
we don't have to go off condoms.

So you're the one guy in the world
who wants to still wear a condom?

Do you have something?

No, it's not like that.

I'm just saying the pill
is a big commitment.

Oh, so do you not want
to take this step?

Because I already went
to planned parenthood,

And I never plan anything.

Max, I guess I'm just surprised...

Hold that thought.

- I hear nothing.
- So?

So that's what Caroline
sounds like during sex!

Keep talking like I'm here.

Uh...

Ah, oh, yeah, baby!

Right there!
That's the spot!

Yeah, now slap my face with 'em!

Well, if you were still here,
that's what I'd be saying.

I'm sorry, I'll switch it up.

Uh, go fish, Max.

- Max, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

We're fine.
We're just lying here talking.

No, we're not.
I'm really turned on.

Why?
What's he doing to you?

It's not him, it's me.
I'm the predator here.

You were right. You better stop me.
Get up here with us.

I'm not getting in bed with you.

Max, get in the bed.

I know a Jaques-block when I see one.

I am so sorry.

This is silly.
I know it must be hard for you.

Uh, not anymore.

You know, last night
when you and I were in bed,

I realized I guess Nicolas is just gonna
be one of those people in my life

that I'm always gonna almost
have sex with, but I never will.

You know?

Yeah, like me and you.

- Hey, Deke.
- Hey, Earl.

Best conversation I had today.

Max, last night I got the idea
that maybe you thought

that I didn't want to take our
relationship to the next level.

What is this,
"previously on Deke"?

And just to prove that I do
want to go to the next level,

I got you a ring.

Oh, my God, Max!
I'm so happy for you!

Even though I thought I'd be
the first one to get engaged.

I think we all thought that.

Deke, I don't know what you're gonna pull
out of your pocket, but it better be a gun.

Actually, I know you don't
want a ring-ring.

But how about a NuvaRing?

A NuvaRing?

How did you know my size?

I can't wait to try it on.

Well, I am not throwing you
a shower for that.

After I saw how you maybe forgot
to take your pill on day one,

and then took pills all day
just to be safe,

I thought you'd need a little help.

So there, Max. Will you not
have children with me?

You're damn right I won't.

Oh, wait, I think these
take a couple days to work.

Where are we gonna
get a condom for tonight?

Evening, hot chocolate.

Max, we got big trouble from Little China.

Hi, Max.

Big trouble?

There's nothing big about him. He looks
like they won him in a bear claw machine.

Max, what is the worst sentence you
ever want to come out of Han's mouth?

I got you pregnant?

Come on, bad, bad.

I got you pregnant again?

I'm putting in karaoke.

No! No!

Han...

Those guys better be up there because we're
officially putting ass crack on the menu.

I am adding a TV to bring

We can have theme nights,
Ultimate Fighter nights,

Real Desperate Housewives of Bravo City nights,

and best of all, karaoke night.

You can't give hispters a microphone.

That's like throwing gasoline
on a pretentious fire.

Hipsters like karaoke.

Replace the word "like"

with the word "Hitler"

and you got the three
worst things in history.

Max, I hear what you say, but

everybody else say "he-ey!"

All my single ladies!

Okay. Next person
is going to sing

Teenage Dream by Katy Perry,

who is pretty now but used to
have very horrible acne.

This is the third
Teenage Dream in 45 minutes.

Why don't I just close my nuts
in the cashier's drawer?

Come on up now,
girl named "Stacey."

I got this.

Look, I don't know you,
but I like you.

And I respect both hair choices.

I hate karaoke.

I can't afford to have
any more hate in my head.

My hate is at capacity.

Sit this one out,
I'll comp your cobbler.

What did you do?

Calm your bells down, Oleg.

Not my stations.

Where's Caroline?

Would it make you jealous

if I said she was
back here with me?

Jealous?
No.

Pissed?
Probably, because we're busy

and it would take me
all that time

to get the duct tape
off her mouth and hands.

What are you doin' in here,
snow white?

If you're lookin'
for one of your dwarves,

he's out there,
holding the mic.

Look, my bite is off.

See, I did the bite test.

The number seven incisor is
crossing over number nine.

Hold up. You know
the names of your teeth?

Don't you?

I don't even know
the name of my father.

Ow, I just bit my tongue.

Ah! Number 12 just joined
the party.

I'd stop doing that right now.

You just made it
into Oleg's spank bank.

Congratulations.

What am I gonna do
without my bite guard?

My teeth don't know where to go.

Well, maybe the should just
backpack for a couple of years,

so they figure it out.

Listen, perfect teeth,

this is a nightmare for me.

The technical term for this is
"advanced bruxism."

And the technical term for you
is "overly dramatic."

Yesterday you freaked out 'cause
we were out of toilet paper.

Just hold it till you get
to work like everybody else.

Now, maybe I sing
while others wait.

Uh-oh.
We got real problems now.

I choose Susan Boyle
popular song

from all clips on Internet.

It's called I Dream--

Keep dreaming.

Oh, you're back.

We thought you ran away.

Chestnut and I were
just about to pick out

another human from the shelter.

I had quite a day.

8:00 to 10:00...
Grind, grind, pain.

10:00 to 11:00...
Pain, pain, grind.

So I went to the drug store

and bought an $8 bite guard,

which didn't fit
my freaky Tim Burton mouth.

And when I tried to return it,

the cashier, Rhonda,

whose nametag said
she was happy to help,

but who was neither happy
nor helpful,

said that I couldn't return it

because it had already
touched my "teef."

For someone whose jaw
is about to unhinge,

you're sure flapping it a lot.

Why is this rag
with my father on it here?

Don't look at me.
Chestnut bought it.

He likes it when I read him
his daily horse-oscope.

Why is everybody so obsessed
with the fact that

he hasn't said anything?

Haven't you ever been
at a loss for words?

Tampons, yes.
Words, nah.

Well, this will
make me feel better.

Whenever I'm in pain,
I need a treat.

You know, whenever you're
in pain, that is my treat.

Sushi!
I hope you like crab roll.

I never had sushi.

That doesn't even make sense.

No sushi, no dentist...
Who are you?

A poor person.

Sushi's lazy.

If I come to your restaurant,

get up off your ass
and cook the damn fish.

I wish we could afford to go
to this little sushi place

in Tribeca where
my father always took me.

We had this little joke.

Every time we'd walk in,
I'd always say...

And we would just laugh!

So you're not funny
in Japanese either.

I got this at a corner deli.

The cashier was Japanese.

She said it was good.

Oh,
I'm sure it's great.

'Cause
the disenfranchised immigrant

serving the spoiled white girl

would have no reason to lie.

Get ready
for something heavenly!

That's not heaven.

- Spit it out.
- Ugh!

Ugh!

What a disappointment.

Your first time.

Well, that's kinda the way
it goes with me and first times.

Here, clean yourself off.

That's exactly the way it goes!

It's not that bad.

It's not that bad.
It's not that bad.

No.

For a dentist office
in the subway,

it's pretty good.

Seriously, how are you
not running out of here?

I have no choice.

Now that I have no money
or health insurance,

I have to get used to
this third-world situation.

Third-world situation?

This is an underworld situation.

Okay,
there's bulletproof glass.

With a bullet in it.

All right, so the glass works.

It says to sign in.

Look, why don't you just

take some of our
cupcake business savings

and go to a good dentist office?

You know, one where you
won't get a staph infection

just from looking at the floor.

No, we can't do that.

That's our future.

Once we start doing that,

it's a slippery slope.

"Nicole Richie"?

I don't want anyone to know
I was here.

I know this situation
is less than ideal,

but I am having
a dental emergency.

No, he's having
a dental emergency.

Come on, let's go over here
and see if this man can help me.

Hi.

Welcome to Subway Smiles.

I told ya, we'll get to ya.

I'm sorry, girls.

I'm a little shaky.

I was just shot at.

I have a problem
with my teeth migrating.

I have advanced bruxism.

Ah.
I have hep C.

Everybody's got
their something.

What do you need?

We need to be leaving.

I just need a bite guard.

Oh!
I can do that.

That's where I squirt foam
into your mouth

and make a mold.

Come in the back.

If you go back there with him,

you'll need a bite guard
and a rape guard.

You want the gas?

Is that necessary?

You're gonna want the gas,
sweetheart.

Let's get outta here.

One more song before we close.

I sing Spice Girls'

Aww, tell me what you want,

what you really, really want.

That boy's more stiff

than Michele Bachmann's husband
at a Chippendales.

I will give you the money
for trip to fancy dentist.

Really?
Oleg, you would do that?

It's favor I do for you.

And at some point,
when I come to you for favor,

you will say yes,
like I say yes now.

Well, I'd need to know
what that favor might be.

I can't say for sure.

Will it be in a week
or a month?

I can't say for sure.

Will it be sexual?

Yes, it will be.

This I can say for sure.

Thank you, but no.

I am such an idiot.

I like it.
Keep going.

My bite guard is
just sitting in the bathroom

of my townhouse.

If I could only
get up on the roof,

then I could break in
through the skylight

like I used to when I snuck out
in high school.

Hello, I'm Max.
Have we met?

When I was 15, I paid
the security system guys extra

to not wire the skylight,

and then I snuck out and went
to Ilana Shapiro's Sweet 16...

- Cute.
- In Greece.

Hardcore.

I used to sneak
out of the house

and huff spray paint
with an ex-marine.

And sometimes,
I'd just sneak out,

look up at the stars,
and dream.

And then you said that.

See, I told you I can get this skylight open.

Turn on a light!

Wait till I close
the closet door.

Why are the floors so bouncy?

It's called "carpet."

What?

No way.
No way.

Is this Narnia?

I'm about to say something
I swore I'd never say.

O.M.G.

Again...O.M.G.

It's lame, but nothing else
really nails it.

This is the room that O.M.G.
was born for.

Max, it's just my closet.

Your clothes have a house!

Look, look!

You are rich!

Like, I know you've said
you were rich,

but you are rich.

You're embarrassing me.

Are you crazy?

This is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

What's this do?

Oh, my God.

You have a shoe rotisserie.

I designed it.

I call it my
"Ferris Heels."

I'd judge you
if that wasn't exactly what

I'd call it if I had one.

Okay, we should really go now.

Lemme just grab my bite guard.

What?

You have a museum
in your closet?

Come on, it's just a bathroom.

Just a bathroom?

It's the Louvre of pooping.

Here it is.

Ow. Ow. Ow.

Oh, yeah.

Do you two need
to be left alone?

We have to go.

Can't risk staying much longer.

Wow.
Just when I thought your voice

couldn't get any more grating.

It'll loosen up.

Oh.

Seriously, we should go.

Oh, um, I just have to do
one more thing before we go.

I think me and your tub
are going steady.

Oh, you found
the jacuzzi button.

I don't know who found who,

but we're together now.

I'm totally stealing some
of these ridonculous bath soaps.

This one's shaped like a vagina.

Seashell.

Sister, this is
a mint green vagina.

Did you go to the prom
with your dad?

That's my debutante dance,

when I came out.

Out?

Like you came out
that you were dating your dad?

Gross.

I think I can still fit
a goose feather pillow in.

Hey, what's this one of you
and Chestnut and your dad?

Oh, that's when my dad

bought Chestnut for me.

It was my first-period present.

Your dad got you a horse
for getting your period?

O.M.G.

Know how I celebrated
getting my period?

Stole a painkiller
and half a beer

from my mom's boyfriend.

Wasn't a horse,
but it was pretty awesome.

How come there are no pictures
of your mom?

'Cause there aren't any.

She cheated on my dad
when I was five,

and my grandmother
got rid of her.

Not in, like, a mob way.

In a society way,
which is worse.

So who raised you?

Well, Estella from 1989 to '96.

Then, Dominica from '97 until
she went back to Guatemala.

Then no one.

Funny.

You didn't have a father, and I
didn't have a mother. So we're--

Oh, we're alike?

Look around.
We have nothing in common.

Hey, what's this button for?

Music.

Oh, lemme guess.
Show tunes? Boy bands?

Both: I love this song!

♪ You are the girl ♪

♪ that I've been dreamin' of ♪

♪ ever since
I was a little girl ♪

♪ you are the girl ♪

♪ that I've been dreamin' of ♪

♪ ever since
I was a little girl ♪

♪ One!
I'm bitin' my tongue ♪

♪ Two!
He's kissin' on you ♪

♪ Three!
Oh, why can't you see? ♪

♪ do do do do do do do ♪

♪ do do do do do do do ♪

♪ do do do do do do do ♪

♪ Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! ♪

♪ Dance! Dance! Dance!
Dance! Dance! ♪

See?

I knew what we had
in common wouldn't last.

Were you crumping for a second?

Maybe. Were you
tootsie-rolling for a second?

Yes.

Okay, get dressed.

We really should go now.

I have all the essentials.

Tampons, toilet paper,
comforter, body shimmer.

Wait, what about the clothes?

Oh, what am I gonna do?

Walk around Williamsburg
in a $3000 gown?

Oh, my God.

Wait a minute.

Grab everything
with a price tag on it

that we can resell.

Or that you think
I'd look amazing in.

Not the furs!
They're wired!

Why would you wire the furs?

Everybody wires the furs,
bitch!

Security's gonna be here
in ten minutes.

Just grab everything you can.

Wait! How are we going to
carry it all back to Brooklyn?

Jealous?

Look, two seats.

I think you got more stuff
than me.

Well, you spent five minutes
saying good-bye to the tub.

This was my fa purse
to take dancing.

How'd you keep it
on your shoulder

when you went all mad crump?

Look.
$200!

It's not enough we're sitting
on the subway in furs...

You gotta make it rain?

This is so exciting.

It's going right
into our cupcake fund.

- Or--
- Or what?

Where was that place you
always went with your dad?

Toro with black truffle.

You are about to have
a sushi toro-gasm.

Will you calm down?
It's just--

Oh, sweet bejesus,
that's delicious!

If this is sushi,

what was that other stuff
we ate?

Wrong.
On every level.

We need more of this.

Like, all of it.

Can we have some more toro?

Thank you so much.

And, uh...

I get it now 'cause I'm rich.

I don't know how
you're pulling it off.

What do you mean?

Giving up everything
that you had.

The maids, the closet,
the dentist, the sushi, the tub.

All of it.
The tub.

I almost can't give it up,

but I only had it for an hour.

You're kind of a badass.

Max, you just called me
a badass.

I'm drunk on black truffle.

It's my dad!

Wait, he actually exists?

Like the townhouse and the tub?

The tub.

Hi, daddy.
How are you?

I miss you so much.

I'm good.
No, really.

I'm still staying in Brooklyn
with my friend, Max.

She's great.

Oh!

Oh, okay.
Hold on.

Love you, daddy.

He wants to talk to you.

Me? Why?

I wouldn't know what to say.

Take it!
He's only allowed five minutes.

Yo, what's up, Martin Channing?

Oh.

You're welcome, but I di--

Well, thank you.

Yeah, she's great.

Real trooper.

Well, bye.
What?

Okay, I'll tell her.

Daddy?

He's gone.

So that's what a father
sounds like.

What did he say?

He wanted me to remind you
to wear your bite guard.

See, he can't be
as bad as everyone says.

He just can't be.

Oh, my God.

The 200 didn't cover it.

Start checking the purses!

Oh, hey.
Do you take hats?

Any cougars in the house?

And in case you don't know,

"cougar" means older lady
with a large sexual appetite.

Lady past prime
with tight clothes

who wants sex from young men.

Max, what is the one thing
worse than karaoke?

Oh, no.

That's right.
Open mic night.

Cougar also have face lift.

From behind, look 22.

She turn around, 72.

It's true!

It's funny 'cause it's true.

Bad news.

They heightened security
because we tripped the alarm.

The entire townhouse
is locked down.

We can never go back!

My tub!

Why does anything that gives me
pleasure wind up behind bars?

Forget about the tub.

Everything was inventoried.

We can't sell the furs.

I should've thought of that!

Yeah, you should've.

'Cause you know they always
inventory the furs, bitch!

Previously on 2 Broke Girls!

Sophie, this is
so generous of you

to offer to buy us dresses
for the gala,

but as much as my shoes
love being back

- in their place of birth...
- Oh, your shoes were born here?

Mine were born in China,
but I adopted them at payless.

Maybe we should
find something cheaper,

at one of
those consignment stores.

"Consignment stores"?

Come on,
what are we, gypsies?

This is big fancy ball.
We need ball gowns.

Never really been
a fan of balls.

In fact, always thought
they got in the way,

but here we are.

Well, we do have
to look amazing

if we're approaching
Martha Stewart with a cupcake,

so we'll find
a way to pay you back

and start by doing some
cleaning jobs for you for free.

No! Every year
I give money to charity,

and I like
you two girls

way more than the babies
with the broken smiles.

So don't worry.
I got plenty of cash.

Aww, a roll of hundreds.

Reminds me of my Christmas
stocking stuffers.

Yeah, this is fun day.

I'm like Richard Gere
and you're my two hookers.

Well, when you put it
like that,

I'm a little
more comfortable.

Good afternoon.
How can I help you?

Hi, how are you?
We don't have a lot of time.

We have to be
at work by 6:00.

Can you show us your best
formal spring couture?

Perhaps you ladies
might be more comfortable

down in ready-to-wear.

As I said,
we're in a bit of a rush.

We might move a little quicker
if you dropped the attitude

and picked up
some dresses.

Show her your wad.

Let's look
at some dresses.

Yeah, and get us
some champagne,

like in the movies.

# The patron, own,
let's go get it on #

# the zone, own,
yes, I'm in the zone #

# is it two, three,
leave a good tip #

# I'm-a blow off my money

one more time #

One, two.

Han, did you just go up
on your tiptoes like a big boy?

Well, I wasn't expecting
a photo opportunity.

And I left my tom cruise
man-heels at home.

Max, give him a break.

This is a man who was
too short to be a jockey.

Oleg, give me your camera.

I must approve picture.

We've taken it
three times already.

Han, if you want
a nip slip, just ask.

My dress is too pretty
for this conversation,

so I'm gonna go get the cupcake
from the refrigerator.

And I'm going to warm up
my new town car for the ladies.

New?

What is this, 2002?

I hope so,

then I will have chance
to meet you for first time

all over again.

Now this is not
professional driver talk.

Hey, fancy ball Buster,
what's your deal?

You told him to get
a dream and a drive,

and he did.

Max, I have two sore spots.

Trusting men and...

And here, where that
crazy Jamaican

wove my extensions
too tight.

I'm thinking I should wait
to put the cupcake

in the cupcake purse
till we get out of the car.

We want our beer batter
maple bacon cupcake

to represent
our cupcake business.

We have a new record.

She cupcake four times
in one speech.

We should go.
Upper East Side from Brooklyn

at this time of day
is crazy.

But we came in here
to show Earl.

Maybe Earl decided
not to come

since he had the night off.

Max, we really should
be there at the start.

That's prime Martha Stewart
stalking time.

You're right.
And Martha will probably

have to leave early
to get up to bake;

A little something
I knows about.

The only difference
between Martha and I

is she probably doesn't
have to worry about

waking up her roommate
who lives

four feet from the oven.

But otherwise, twinsies!

Hold up, hold up, hold up.

Earl, slow down,
your heart.

Sorry I'm late, ladies.

But if I run any faster,
the cops

tend to pull guns on me.

Got held up
at the florist shop,

but I made it.
Here you go, ladies.

Aww, Earl,
you got us flowers?

Wrist corsages.

I hope they're still
in style.

They're a classic, Earl.

Like you.

Mmm, that was
worth the run.

Let's go, ladies.

Oleg is waiting
to drive you.

And you drive me crazy.

Yeah, yeah.
Tell it to the marines.

Here, Earl,
take my phone.

I can't fit it
in the purse with my cupcake.

Have the best time
in the world.

And say hello
to "huge" Jackman for me.

That is not a good sign.

That car is smoking harder
than Bob Marley

on a rasta holiday.

Sophie, if my cousin Yuri
said he would be here

in half hour
with parts to fix,

he will be here
in half hour.

Actually, it's been
40 minutes.

Your cousin is like you.

- He takes too long to come.
- Oh, this is news.

Suddenly a woman
wants a man to finish fast.

Oh, please.

Sex is not
a carnival cruise.

I'm a busy woman.

You get on,
you get off.

Can I get a hit off that?

We'll just have to wait,
I guess.

I mean, if I still lived
in Manhattan, I'd hail a cab.

But that's not gonna happen
out here in the boondocks!

Plus, even if we could
afford a cab,

we'd be stuck forever
in rush hour gridlock.

Could you take it down
a notch?

Hipsters are starting
to look at us

like we're trying too hard.

Where did han go?

He said he might
have a plan.

Oh, my lord and Taylor!

That little mother
can ride.

You two look like
two princesses in a fairy tale.

Are you feeling safe?

I couldn't feel any safer

if we were riding
a rubber into town.

Here we go.
Bye, guys.

- Bye.
- Go, Chestnut!

Oh, check it out.
You see what I see?

Hello, officers.

We're on way to the ball
down the street,

and we were wondering
if we could please leave

our horse with your horses?

And I can save you
the time

on the breathalyzer test;

No, we are not drunk

or on some bachelorette
party scavenger hunt.

Our car broke down
in Brooklyn,

so we rode over
the Brooklyn bridge and up.

You rode a horse
across the Brooklyn bridge?

That's badass.

Yes...
And illegal.

In that case,
we took the tunnel.

Well, I think we can help
you two ladies.

Not gonna happen, Dave.
We're on duty.

Officers, we're already
a little late.

And with all due respect,
we don't have time

to play good cop,
bad cop.

Or in your cases,
hot cop, hot cop.

Well, I think we can help
you ladies.

Let's get you down
off of there.

I got the one
in the low-cut.

Thanks officer hot
and officer hotter.

Max, I'm really impressed
with how well

you're maneuvering around
in that long skirt.

Yeah, I was a serving wench
at a medieval times restaurant.

It's a breeze
when I'm not carrying

a tray loaded
with Turkey legs and ale.

There's the "will call"
table.

Walk in front
and I'll hide behind you,

as I'm the most hated woman
in New York.

So basically,
I'm a human shield?

Well, you have more up here
to stop anything.

- Max!
- What?

Did someone pull a gun?

I knew that
was gonna happen.

No, I screamed because
I saw the couple

whose sworn statement
put my father in prison.

Max!

Acid in your pretty face?

Sorry, I stayed up
all night reading

what people want to do
to you in your hate mail.

What was it?

I went down so fast,
I may have smeared my cupcake.

That's the filthiest sounding
clean thing I ever heard.

It's fine. Good.

Now let's go get those cheap
plastic security bracelets

that ruin
our expensive gowns.

- Can I get your name?
- Caroline...

Channing.

I'm sorry, what?

Caroline...

Channing.

What's with you?
Just say your name.

Channing.

Did you say channing?
Caroline channing?

Wait, are you
that Caroline channing?

Shh, yes, and I personally
called the R.S.V.P. number.

It has to be there.

Channing,
channing, channing...

No, I don't see
"Caroline channing."

Shh.
Maybe it's under my name.

Max black.
I'm with her.

Black... no, no, no,
I don't see any blacks here.

You mean besides
the ones working security?

Let me check with Paul Platt,
the party planner.

He's on the phone
with him right now.

Hey, Brody.
Both: Oh, no.

There's a problem
with the list.

She's not on it.
Her.

- Caroline channing.
- Sh

Paul, I've got
Caroline channing,

and she's not on the list.

If everybody in this line
could just wait until

we get the Caroline channing
situation under control...

If you say "channing"
one more time,

I'm going to actually
pull your voice box out.

And its s so much
more violent than it sounds.

Yes, Paul,
I'll tell them.

There's been
a little mix-up.

Five more minutes
will get you right in.

You're not getting in.

Well, that's it.
We tried.

- We gave it our best shot.
- Oh, no.

This is the closest
I have ever gotten

to anything in my life
almost working out.

- We are not giving up.
- How are we getting in?

- Security's everywhere.
- Yeah, out here,

but not
at the servers' entrance.

I catered this
last year.

That's right,
we're going backdoor.

Ooh!

That lady
just punched me.

I knew
that was gonna happen!

So you can
just walk in here?

Anyone can
just walk right in?

Well, it helps
that last year

I made out with
the tent flap guard, Rico,

but basically,
yeah, anyone.

When I think
of all the times

I left my purse
on a table here unattended,

I shudder...
Shudder.

Okay, so we can't
get in the actual building

without being caterers,

so we have to change
into those uniforms.

Wait.

You never mentioned
anything about

a rent-a-clothes
situation.

Small price to pay
for us making it.

Is it? Is it
a small price to pay?

Hurry, we have
a superstar to stalk!

I thought I would hate it,
but I'm kind of into it.

I'm very Janelle Monae.

No, you're Janelle
I-have-no-Monae.

What are we going to do
with our dresses?

We can't leave them out here.
I need them inside.

I have to look amazing
when I meet Martha Stewart.

What does it matter
what we're wearing?

We're still going to be
the two crazy girls

chasing her down
with a cupcake.

- That's why it matters.
- Oh, ooh!

I know.
Here.

Help me get
the shelves out of this.

We can hang
our dresses in here

and push them in.
Brilliant.

Kind of like the Louis Vuitton
travel wardrobe I used to have.

Or the service elevator
I was born in.

Coming through, hot food.

Look out, very hot!
Man, it's hot.

You're a waiter,
not a weatherman.

Hey, pretty girls,

I like the way you push around
that big steel box

why don't you come over here
and I'll have sex with you?

A display like that
really makes you appreciate

oleg's nuanced wit.

Okay, let's go right
to the ladies room

so we can change.

Is it that way
or that way?

What?

Shh, Johnny!

How'd he get invited?

This used to be
an exclusive event.

He's "made it,"

he goes where
"made it" people go.

Why are we hiding
from that lowlife?

If he sees me
in another waiter uniform,

I'm the sad girl
always in the uniform.

If he sees me
in that dress at the ball,

he can suck it.

Ladies room, that way.

The ladies room
is right down here.

Push harder. Harder!

Do you want Martha
to see you dressed like that?

- Move! Coming through!
- Excuse us.

Food emergency.

Fingers, fingers,
fingers, fingers.

Coming through,
coming through.

- Excuse us.
- Look alive, red!

- I almost hit you.
- Hold up.

Now just hold up.
What is going on right now?

You can't bring
food in here.

Oh, it's not food.
That would be weird.

It's dresses.
We have to change into these,

'cause she has this guy
she wants to impress,

and I have to change
into it

because I'm stalking
Martha Stewart.

Ooh, I'd be
a terrible spy.

Usually I don't get
the long stories

till the end of the night,

and by then,
the girls are crying

and begging me
for Wisdom and tic tacs.

I'll go first.

I have to get two of these
in one dress.

Miss, do you have
a shoehorn?

Come on,
chanel shoes!

Come on,
chanel knockoffs.

Why are you
not dressed yet?

'Cause ladies take forever.

It's all the spanx.

Well, go, use my stall.
I want to go stick my head out,

and see if I
can scope out Johnny.

No, ma'am, no!
Not fair, ma'am.

Try the handicapper.
This side.

Good idea.

I cannot
get a break tonight.

- Psst, yo, Max.
- Johnny!

Who are you looking for?

The Dominos guy.

I was hiding in there,
'cause five more minutes,

the pizza's free.

I was hoping
I'd run into you.

Eh, no big deal.

Pretty big deal.
You look amazing.

Amazing. I will go
as far as amaze-balls.

Thanks.

You look like a guy
in a commercial

who has a ring and puppy
hidden somewhere.

Can you believe it?

We're both
at this shmancy thing.

Look how far we've gotten.

Actually,
when you think about it,

we didn't get
very far at all.

Nope, you're right.
We didn't.

Yeah, why?

Timing, I guess.

Timing?

Okay, whatever.

You know, from now on,
when I think of you,

I'm gonna think of you in this
and not the uniform.

You know,
from now on,

maybe you shouldn't
think of me at all.

Gotta go,
Mr. Manhattan.

That was awesome!
Caroline, where are you?

I'm almost dressed.

I just had the perfect
in-your-face good-bye

with Johnny.

And speaking of
"in your face,"

he couldn't take his eyes
off my boobs...

Boobs that
he can never have,

now that
he's getting married.

Damn, girl, you look good.
What you doing later?

Can I get your number?

Oh, no, the cupcake got
a little smushed in my purse.

We can't show this
to Martha Stewart now.

Sure, we can.

You think she never
had a cupcake smush on her?

I doubt that very much.

Martha Stewart
is perfect.

Her feet don't even
touch the ground.

The woman probably doesn't
even go to the bathroom.

Martha Stewart's
hardly perfect.

And how are you
this evening?

No, you're right,
Martha Stewart isn't perfect.

Oh, I never said that!

In fact, I hear
she's a real ballbuster.

You did not hear that.

Yep, a real ballbuster,
you know?

No, I do not know.

Would you mind handing me
a towelette please?

Oh, one's fine.
Thank you so much.

But the fact that Martha
Stewart is so tough...

Caroline, you need
to get out here right now.

The fact that she
is a real ballbuster...

Oh, dear God, help me.

Is what I like
and respect about her.

I mean,
the woman's a genius.

Now it's getting
interesting.

And besides, you can't
really believe gossip.

Look at all
that hate mail I got

with people
calling me a bitch,

and I'm not a bitch.

Well, that's debatable.

- Martha Stewart, hi.
- Hello.

I'm Caroline, and this is
my business partner, Max,

and we have
a start-up cupcake business.

Dude, are you serious?
You're still going for it.

I know this is
highly inappropriate,

but we brought
a cupcake here tonight

in hopes that
you might taste it.

So you want me
to taste your cupcake

in the ladies room.

What's inappropriate
about that?

We're a start-up business.
We've got to take risks.

This is Max.
She's the baker.

You're the baker.

I'm the baker.

Hm, it looks
quite appealing.

Oh, my God.

I know this
is a social event,

so I'm so sorry
for making it about business.

When you're in business
for yourself,

you have
to take every situation

as a business opportunity.

Look, I have
five of these in here.

I love your magazine.

I read every single issue

until they realized I didn't
even go to that doctor.

Well, in spite
of the fact

that you have not
yet washed your hands...

I was just changing
my dress in there.

- I'll taste it.
- You will?

I like
your entrepreneurial drive.

And I have a feeling
that it's actually

the only way I'm gonna
get out of here alive.

That is our beer batter maple
bacon spring break cupcake.

- Hm, clever name.
- Thank you.

It is a little smushed,
though. That's unfortunate.

I told you.

Mmm.
Quiet tasty.

I like it.

Do you girls have a card?

Get it out, get it out,
get it out.

Ah, thank you very much.

"Max's homemade cupcakes."

Well, you know who'd
really like that cupcake?

Stoners.

She said
"Max's homemade cupcakes."

Both: Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!

Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!

Earl, I noticed
you're still alive.

What's your secret?

Well, it's my positive
attitude,

a little bit of genetics,

and knowing how to take care
of your body.

I use jojoba.

What is that, like a lotion?

No, it's a ho named hoba.

She comes over once a week.

(peter bjorn and John)
¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ¶

Max, you just got box delivered
at home.

I don't want another box.

I got my hands full
with this one.

I used to have so many packages
delivered to my house,

my dad had to buy fedex
just to save money.

I remember a time before mail.

You just didn't get stuff.

Nope.
I don't want that.

It's a delivery from my mother.

The last thing she delivered
was me,

and I'm still cleaning up
that mess.

Aren't you at least curious
what she sent?

Unless it's a brand new
childhood,

I'm not interested.

Here, Earl, hold Max's box.

But she's like a daughter
to me.

Look, Caroline,
I brought in my fish tank,

which Max has been calling
my olympic-size swimming pool.

See, han? The world's different
above sea-level.

Now, come over here
and say hello.

I'm saying hello to fish now?

That's where I'm at?

You too, Max.

I want my diner family
to meet my fish family.

I got an aunt that drinks
like a fish.

Maybe she's in there.

Oh, no, she's in jail
for vehicular manslaughter.

Please enjoy my ecosystem
of love.

Never tap on the glass!

Just look at that meaty paw
of yours.

It's like an earthquake
to them.

Oh, there's my prize.

The royal blue tang fish.

$500.

Han, I'm not surprised
you have to pay for blue tang,

but $500 seems high.

Hey han,
jojoba'll do it for 25.

Well, I hope your fish
will be very happy here.

I mean, no one else is,
but who knows.

Let's go, Max.

[Speaking Ukrainian]

Did Oleg take Liam neeson's
daughter?

I'm breaking up
with all my ladies

so I can start up again
with Sophie.

And oksana's not taking
it lying down,

or bent over
like she usually is.

Well, I'm sorry
I never got to meet her.

Just tell her that you
and Sophie have decided to be--

what's the Ukrainian word
for "monogamy"?

There isn't one.

You're either ugly or
you're sleeping with everyone.

Uh-uh.
No way.

Leave it out here.

Let the bomb-squad
figure it out.

don't you wanna know
what she sent you?

Maybe there's money in there.

[Obnoxious laughter]

So you're just gonna leave it
out in the hall

like a room service tray?

Oh, my god,
I used to have room service.

Oh, my god,
I used to have a room.

Well, I don't want
it in the apartment.

This is a place of positive
energy and good vibes.

[Obnoxious laughter]

I'm sending it back
to her tomorrow.

I will go to my shallow,
unmarked grave

not knowing what's in that box.

[Knock at door]

Hey, Max, you got a box
out here,

and there's a Bear in it!

Oh, my god.

She kept that?

How did my mom ever keep that?

She can't even keep her teeth.

That's what was in the box?

A Teddy ruxpin doll?

Are you registered
at mustybears.Com?

Not a doll and not his name.

I had it legally changed
to t-rux.

I used the same lawyer
my mom hired

to declare me native American
so she didn't have to pay

for parking at the casino.

For six months,
I had to answer the phone,

"Max proudfoot."

You know, in Poland,
we didn't have dolls.

Yeah, we just hired
little gypsy kids

and we carried them around.

Yeah, mine was called gurgio.

Yeah, and I think uh,
he had a little bit of polio.

Hey, didn't those things talk?

They did if you had
four "c" batteries.

Wait, I think I have some.

Yup, they came
with this adorable Teddy Bear

singing cassette,
so of course,

I smashed that with a rock
and made my own.

Yeah, my gurgio didn't talk.

I'm not sure he had a tongue.

But he used to squeeze me
really tight.

And then I found out later,
he was 35.

You had four "c" batteries
in your nightstand?

From what?

Do you wanna hear the Bear talk
or don't you?

[Phone rings]

Oh, I'm sorry, girls.

I gotta take this.

It's another guy
that I'm breaking it off with.

I sure hope Oleg's worth it.

I just dumped a guy
with multiple personalities.

Yeah, and he took it okay,

and not great,

and pretty bad.

There's no note
or anything.

This box is really just a well
of disappointment.

Why would your mother
send you this?

Why would she do anything?

Why would she bite our dog?

Why would she make out
with our Jack o'lantern?

I don't know.

Well, Max, she did send you
your favorite toy

after all these years.

Maybe she's trying
to make amends.

Oh, make amends?

She couldn't even make me
a sandwich.

Okay, you ready?

I know you are,
but what am I?

[Laughing]

Oh, my god.
Max, is that you?

Is that your little Max voice?

Careful, I'm about to open up
a can of whoop ass.

It is you!
How old were you there?

Ten. "Whoop ass"
was kind of my thing.

Still is.

I mean, I guess I always knew
you were a little kid once,

but I couldn't picture
it till I heard that.

Like I couldn't picture me
eating fruit

from an exxon station
till I did that.

So, are you two ready
to order?

Oh, yeah. I'll have
the Turkey club with fries.

This is why you're single,
Rita.

I'm not single.
I'm married to your father.

I love you, but stop pushing
your lifestyle in my face.

I'll have the salad.
Dressing on the side.

Obvs.

Obvs, obvs.

Well, I'm sending t-rux
back to my mother.

He's going right
into this empty box

I found in han's office.

And Max, before you send
it back,

I'm gonna need those batteries.

Oh, don't worry, I have
no desire to see you

hugging the milkshake machine.

Oh...My...God!

Is that a Teddy ruxpin doll?

Rita, I want that!

Your birthday just passed,
Elliot.

But my coming out party
is coming up.

What is that,
like a queen-ceanera?

So bitchy. Love her.

A vintage Teddy ruxpin
is worth like, $500,

and my mom works,
so she has to buy my love.

One more word,
and I'm taking away spa day.

That's harsh, honey.

He's obsessed with the '90s.

But you weren't even born.

I know.
I blame her.

She couldn't find a man
till late in life.

There go the pedicures.

There go my sandals.

As much as I love watching
will and grace,

this guy's not for sale.

I'm sending him back
to my mother's place,

which, according to
the Rhode Island parole office,

is a cardboard shanty town
outside of big lots.

Well, here's my card.

And let's face it, you look
like you could use $500.

So bitchy.
Love him!

I was just offered $500
for t-rux

from baby Anderson Cooper.

He has cards?

I'm jealous
of a nine-year-old?

That's where I'm at?

Hey, as much as I would like
that $500,

my mother doesn't
get to think this Bear

gets to make up
for my childhood.

She doesn't get off that easy.

Trust me, we shared a pullout
couch for nine months.

Girls,
can I see you over here?

I can't believe we have
to talk to the fish again.

I can't believe Max hasn't
put han in the tank yet.

Max, Caroline, every night
from now on,

I need you to move the skimmer
along the top of the water

and take out
the floating matter.

Han, you know I'm off diner poop
patrol for life

after I had to clean the booth
where the senior left...

Well, we'll just call
it an elderberry.

Well, Caroline, Max said no,
so you have to do it.

Han, you're kind of a baller
around your fish.

All right, I'm gonna do this
fast.

Get in and get out--

same thing I do when
that bird is in our shower.

[Bell dings]
Pick up, Max.

Look, I'm calling to tell you
I met somebody else

so I'm breaking up with you.

Now put your mother on.
I'm breaking up with her too.

I can't believe this.

I'm a cabana boy for fish.

I guess now I can add
"fish poop remover"

to my resume
next to "supreme court intern."

I feel like there was a fish
in that last one.

Yup.

Oh, no, it's the expensive one!

That's so me.

I really didn't expect to see
you digging through garbage

till you were 30.

Oh! Ah! Ugh!
It's still alive!

I need to keep her wet.

Oh, covered in tuna, that's
gotta be traumatic for it.

I feel like it went down
the drain.

It was an accident.
I swear.

I love fish.
I would never hurt one.

Unless you count eating Sushi,
'cause then I'm like

Jack the ripper.

Caroline, are things
going swimmingly?

Jack, he's talking to you.

Uh, oh, yeah.
Swimmingly.

Especially the blue one.

He went in his little house.

He doesn't like
to use the restroom

in front of his friends.

Yeah, we're a lot alike.

Thank you so much
for seeing us so quickly.

Sure, you guys can just
wait in here.

Elliot's finishing up
with his pilates.

Do yourselves a favor.

Tell him his core looks tight.

Max, I'm so sorry
you have to sell t-rux

for the fish money
because of me.

Talked to the fist,
because the face is pissed.

I'm getting attitude
from a Bear?

That's where I'm at?

I can't believe all this stuff
he has from the '90s.

I can't believe he has to have
a party to come out.

That kid came out, out.

His umbilical cord
is a Gucci belt.

Oh...These toys!

This is like looking back
at my childhood

but, you know, a time before
rainbows became political.

[Gasps]

Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

Oh, my god.

A my size Barbie!

I had ten of these.

Not to play with,
they were used as decoys

in case of a hostage
situation.

And now your whole life's
a hostage situation.

Sorry I'm late.

My trainer, Gary,
and I got derailed

talking about the real
housewives of orange county.

Your core looks really good.

I know, honey.

Now while I get my check book,
say hello to the olsens.

You got a lot of toys.

When I was a girl your age,
I only had this.

I don't suppose I could play
with my size Barbie

for a second.

I feel like that's
a "no, bitch."

I'm not--I'm not just talking
about the toys.

You got a pretty sweet set-up.

That nice lady out there,
giving you everything you want,

taking care of you.

She's just a mom.
Everyone has one.

Not really. Some people
just have bad ass bears.

Max,
are you sure about this?

This is the only thing you have
from your childhood.

Not true, I have a dent
in my skull

from a ball-peen hammer.

The last time I change
the channel

during three's company.

Can we fast forward this
to me having the Bear

and you two leaving?

Okay, just take it,
it doesn't matter.

No, Max.
It does matter.

We're not selling this.

He has enough toys.

I mean, all I wanted to do
was touch the life-size Barbie.

Okay, I see what's happening.

I've been down this road
with the beanie babies.

I'll give you 600 for the Bear.

Sold.

No, Max!
That's your childhood.

700.
- Sold!

No, Max!

Caroline, my childhood
is not worth $700.

The most my mother ever got
for me was 40 bucks

and a big gulp.

But that's "little you"
in there, Max.

And she's priceless.

And she's about to erased
and taped over

by the soundtrack
from frozen.

Frozen?

Who am I?
Me, a year ago?

No.
Can't have her.

Well, what are we gonna do now
about the other child?

The one in the diner?

Well, I guess he's just gonna
have to grow up.

Grow up? You think
if he had that ability,

he wouldn't have used it yet?

So what--
no Bear?

Oh, please!
You'll have a Bear in your life.

Trust me.

All right, Max.

You're gonna help me
tell him, right?

You like giving him
bad news.

No, I like giving him bad news
about how he's short

and has a big head.

You know, fun bad news.

Exciting news!

I got the fishies
a new house!

I got it cheap.
It was a foreclosure.

Uh, han, can we talk to you
over there

in the booth--the far booth?

Can it wait?
I want to put in the new condo

so Max will stop calling me
a slum lord.

Oh, that can wait,
I mean, those fish

aren't going anywhere.

Except for the blue one,
who's definitely playing

some kind of twisted game
of hide and seek.

Oh, yeah, he loves
that little house.

He's going to love
this one even more.

Max, can you join me?

I'm pretty busy waiting
on tables right now.

Okay, what's going on?

Max has never waited
on a table in her life.

Max, I need you over here.

I'm just putting down
this grilled cheese

'cause I don't want
it to get cold.

Now I'm freaking out!

Max, don't do this to me.

I know where the bodies
are buried, literally.

I move them every six months.

Well, what is it?

Han, sometimes in life,
things happen

that you don't want
to happen.

Yes.

And even though it's hard,
you know,

you just have to face up
to it.

I suppose.

Oh, dear god, this is rough.

And, well...

Han, I don't wanna have
to tell you this,

I know this is the last thing
you ever want to hear--

oh, just say it!

The tampon machine
is broken again.

Later, I'll get my blindfold
and fix it.

Word of advice?

When you do finally
kill me,

you gotta work on your game face
for the cops.

Max, please.

I can't tell han
I murdered his fish.

I can't.

Well, I can't tell him either.

Oh, hell, I'll tell him.

I'm a black man, everyone
already assumes I did it.

Thank you.
Thank you so much.

It's just a fish.
He'll be fine.

I've decided I'll give blue
the new house

at its birthday party later.

It's the damn fish's birthday?

I'm out.

And you're all invited.

Blue's two years old today.

They don't usually live
that long.

No, they do not.

That's it, we can't tell him.

Even at han's age,
which I am guessing

is somewhere between
14 and 53,

some kids just aren't ready
to grow up.

What are we gonna do?

We're gonna run out
and buy a new one.

Where are we gonna get
the money?

Oleg, you know how
two years ago

you offered me $1,000
for a back rub?

Of course.

Caroline will do it
for $500.

Deal.
One last hurrah.

Over the clothes,
above the waist,

and I don't know why,
but you have to wear a condom.

Yes, father Dominic rosello,
please.

Oh, he's celebrating mass?

Oh yeah, could you just tell him
that Sophie kachinski

is converting to monogamy?

And uh, she won't be kneeling
at his altar anymore.

Oh, yeah, yeah,
he'll understand.

Where's han
and does he know?

No, but I can't keep pretending
I see that fish.

I'm a pot-head
with a touch of glaucoma.

I'm seeing stuff
that's not there.

Not seeing stuff
that's there

it's confusing.

Okay.
Come on, come on.

Put it in, put it in,
put it in.

I have a whole new respect
for every guy

that's ever gone out
with you.

Happy birthday, blue!

(Han)
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday, blue.

Where's blue?

I haven't seen her
all day.

I just saw it.

Yeah, it was definitely there.

You're not gonna give blue
that cupcake

without a photo-op, are you?
Where's your iPad?

I just saw it.
Yeah, it was definitely there.

Yeah, han, go!

You need a pic so you can
post it on Facebook

or fishbook or whatever.

Good idea.
Here, hold this.

Hey, Caroline,
you look less flat.

You finally get that boob job
you needed?

I feel like the baggy broke.

Yup, that's what happens
when you get the cheap implants.

Oh, my god,
there is definitely something

moving around in my bra.

Well, it's good you can still
recognize that feeling.

It's right--oh! Oh!
I touched it!

Gross!

Someone, put your hand in my bra
and help me.

Why now?
Now that I'm off the market!

No, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm afraid I'm gonna squish it
and kill it again.

Okay, just get up on the counter
and drop it in the tank.

What?

Get up on the counter,
spread your legs,

and just let it fall
into the tank.

You know what?

Forget the back rub.
After this, we're square.

Okay, straddle the tank,
pull out your uniform,

and let it go.

Now I owe you money.

Just squat over the tank
like you're delivering

a fish baby.

I'm delivering a fish baby?

This is where I'm at?

Stop asking.
That's where you're at.

Okay, now that I saw, right?

Caroline, get down!

It's not that kind of party.

Max, you're really still gonna
send t-rux back?

After we got bullied
by a kid

with a tiffani Amber thiessen
pillow?

Relax, t-rux is right over there
by the register.

And by the way,
he's our first employee.

Anytime we get a bone-head,
customer, he can say,

"talk to the fist,"

(both)
"'Cause the face is pissed."

I'm just sending
my mother something

to say thank you
for everything she gave me

when I was a child.

Aww, what's in there?

Nothing!

Oh, you look pretty sharp tonight, Earl.

Going somewhere special?

Max, i am free black and 75.

Who knows what the night will bring?

Well, here's a twenty.

Can you break this the way you just
broke my heart?

Pop-pop.

Look at all this.

People really tipped us well tonight.

Yeah, well, don't get used to it.

Thanksgiving is almost here,
and as soon as people realize

how much money
they have to spend

on holiday gifts,
their wallets snap tighter

than Kim Kardashian's legs
after the wedding check cleared.

I've always loved
this time of year--

spiced pumpkin lattes,
bringing my winter furs out,

then bringing my winter furs

to the dry cleaner's
to get the red peta paint out.

For me, it was jumping
into a pile of leaves

and finding a used condom.

What's up,
children of the corn?

I will stay tonight
and decorate diner

for American holiday
of Thanksgiving.

Wow. I'm surprised you got
the right holiday decorations.

Last month, you put out
Easter bunnies for Yom Kippur.

So many Jewish holidays,
I cannot Wikipedia them all.

What, like I don't got a life?

My father and I had
a very special

Thanksgiving tradition
every year.

Oh, let me guess.

You'd fly someplace like
the Bahamas, lay by the pool,

and he'd light other people's
stolen money on fire?

No. We'd rent out
the Waldorf Astoria ballrooms

and feed the homeless.

Don't look at me right now.

And after, we'd fly down
to our home in St. Barts

for two weeks.

Okay, you can look at me again.

I stayed
at the Waldorf Astoria once--

For that money,
it should eat me first.

Okay, ready to go?

Han, if you'd really like
to do something in the diner

to honor the spirit
of Thanksgiving,

you can open your doors
and feed the homeless.

Yeah, put your money
where your cornstalk is.

Caroline and I
will work for free.

Isn't it enough that
when I see them on the street,

I smile and pretend
to fumble for change?

No, it isn't.

You can afford to open
the diner for one night.

You can't put a price tag on
those kind of emotional rewards.

Yes, I can.
$18 for 16-pound turkey,

and I will need many of them.

There--price tag.

Here, I will pay for turkeys.

Jeez, dude,
where'd you get that?

I sell cigarettes
from New Hampshire

to schoolkids in New York.

It is a good profit
and beautiful drive.

I love the leaves.

All right.

I'm feeling y'all.
I'll bring the pie.

My mother used to make
the best chocolate pie.

I remember one time
she got so mad

at this white woman
she worked for,

she took this chocolate pie
into the bathroom--

No, hold up.
That was from the help.

I know it's not Burberry
like we're used to,

but I'm telling you,
used moving blankets

are gonna be in this year.

Who's a trendsetter?

We're really lucky
November is so warm.

Another thing I'm giving
thanks for this Thanksgiving--

global warming.

I think the three remaining
polar bears would disagree.

Max, it's time
to teach me how to bake.

Okay, well,
if we're doing that,

first I have to go get baked.

I'm serious.

It's the beginning
of the holiday season,

and with all the potential
Christmas cupcakes

and festive gift baskets,

you're gonna need
as much help as you can get.

Festive holiday gift baskets?

No way.

I'm not into all that crap.

Oh, no. Are you gonna be
one of those,

"I am too cool to believe
in the wonders of Christmas"

type of bitches?

I am so many types of bitches,

I've lost count.

And the only wonder of Christmas
I'm aware of is...

I wonder how you're gonna
keep up that attitude

through Christmas this year.

Why, because this is my first
holiday without any money?

Uh, yeah.

Money isn't what makes

the holidays special, Max.

Uh, yeah.

The holidays
are totally about money.

It's about spending money
to buy things

to stuff into
the giant black sucking hole

in the center of each of us
that reminds us

life is hard and then we die.

And that's my Christmas card.

Max, I'm aware this holiday
season will be challenging,

will I miss my 20-foot
Christmas tree

decorated by ten gay men? Yes.

Will I miss those ten gay men

outing my cousin Steven
before he was ready? No.

My holiday spirit
is bigger than my money.

So come on,
teach me how to bake.

We only have a couple weeks.

Fine. Pour a cup of milk
into the mixer.

This will be fun.

When I was little, I used
to make my father cakes

in my easy-bake oven.

My easy-bake oven
was repossessed.

So, um, speaking of your father,
are you doing okay?

I mean, this is
a hard time of year

for people who have feelings,
and just...

With your father in prison,
how are you doing?

I'm doing great.

I actually just found out
that since it's Thanksgiving,

they're allowing me to come
see him for the first time.

Well, that excitement
will probably taper off

after the full-body
cavity search.

I don't know. I might like it.

It's been a while since
I've had any cavities searched.

All right. Pour the milk, slut.

One cup milk.

There, how's that?

Good.

Now into the mixer.

There, how was that?

Uh-uh. We're not playing

"Rich girl gets a trophy every
time she does something normal"

Just cover the bowl
with the towel

so it doesn't splash out,
and turn it on.

Oh, it's not plugged in.

Oh. Right.

No, not without the towel!

Christmas comes
but once a year,

and I think it just did.

Wow. These high-end mixers
are a lot of money.

I thought if we came
to a big department store,

there'd be a lot of them,
and the prices would be better.

We can't afford these.

How much did you
think they'd be?

I don't know.

I guess I'm not used
to looking at prices.

I usually just point,
pout, and it's purchased.

Yeah, I had a version
of that, only it was more like,

point, and when
they look the other way,

stuff steaks
down your pants and run.

Come on, there has to be
a mixer here we can afford.

There is.

Here.

A $5 spoon?
That's what we can afford?

Yeah, if we put it on layaway,
work hard for a few years.

I'm used to being poor
around your stuff,

but not around stuff
that I want.

What happened to all your
"money's not important"

holiday spirit now?

Max, it feels like you want me

to be depressed
about the holidays.

No, no. I'm just saying
that it's okay for you

not to be all up
and everything around me

if you're not feeling it.

It's all right
to let your dark side out.

Come to the dark side.

Oh, my God.

Look, they're hiring elves.

Why would I go to the dark side

when I could go to Santaworld?

Let's go get in line.
I've always loved Santaworld.

Me too,
as a David Sedaris story,

not as an actual
real-life option.

Come on.

If we get hired, we could use
our employee discount

to get one of the really
good cake mixers.

And then it'd be like
it came from Santa!

Come on, Max,
we'd be great elves.

I have the holiday spirit.
You're great with kids.

And we're both
so desperate for money,

we'll wear
other people's tights.

Max, I've been coming
to this store at Christmastime

with my father
since I was little.

I'd get all dressed up in
my fanciest winter coat and hat

and then stand
in line to see Santa

with my hands in my muff.

And they didn't throw you out?

There is nothing Christmas-y
about this hallway.

It looks like the place
Santa sends promiscuous elves

to get the results
of their S.T.D. test.

Okay, that's
the kind of comment

that almost got us knocked
out of the first round.

You're lucky
I edited your application.

Why, what was so bad?

You requested to work
in Santa's sex toy shop.

Max, that's not even a thing.

Tell that to my
candy-cane-shaped vibrator.

Max!

I call it "Santa's big helper."

Please try and get
into the holiday spirit.

I know. If we get hired,

we'll go right home and watch
Miracle on 34th Sstreet.

It'll be a miracle
on 34th Street

if we make it out of the bottom
of this slave ship

without elf scurvy.

Hi.

I couldn't help but overhear you
mention Miracle on 34th Street.

That's my absolute favorite
Christmas movie.

Mine too!

My second favorite
is it's a wonderful life.

Mine too!

I've got Schindler's List
on Blu-Ray.

- Hi. I'm Mary.
- I'm Caroline.

Hi. I'm Mary.

It's cool.
We don't need to talk.

That's Max. She's kind of
a Grinch about Christmas.

Oh, like my brother Patrick--

He's always teasing me
about loving Christmas.

He calls me "Mary Christmas."

Get it?

It's 'cause my name is Mary.

I can't help it.

It's my favorite time of year.

- Mine too.
- Yo.

Disconnect
before it's too late.

Don't be so cynical.

Especially Christmas eve.

It's an O'Brien
family tradition.

All seven of my sisters
and brothers--

we line up on the staircase
in our brand-new Christmas PJs

and have our picture taken.

Bitch is 30.

It's my father.

Hi, daddy. You'll never guess
where I am right now--

applying for a job
at Santaworld.

No, it's not depressing at all.

The man's in prison, and he
thinks this is depressing.

Oh. Are you sure?

It's really not that far.

Okay. If that's what you want.

Call me on Thanksgiving.
Love you.

He thought about it
and doesn't want me to come.

He said he can't face
having me see him in there.

- You okay?
- Fine.

Quiet, please, people.
I have an announcement.

Everyone in this corridor
has been chosen to be an elf.

Mazel.

Yay, we're elves.

Report to work at 3:00 A.M.
the morning of Black Friday.

Ooh!

This is so exciting!

♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪

Okay, well...

- I'll see you both then.
- Okay, Mary.

Great, 3:00 A.M.--

you, me,
and definitely-a-Virgin-Mary.

Good night. Get home safely.

Ooh. Maybe I should not
have said that to homeless.

That is it.

2:00 A.M.--
Freebie Thanksgiving dinner

is now officially over.

According to my calculations,

we served over
300 turkey dinners

and only had two knife fights.

Thank you, Caroline.

This experience taught me
that rich or poor,

home or homeless,
we are all the same.

Wait. Where's my wallet?

They took my wallet,
those dirty sons of--

Oh, here it is.

Yes, we are all the same.

Well, I have two things to say.

First of all,
I'm incredibly proud of us

for spreading the spirit
of Thanksgiving together.

And secondly, someone left
an adult diaper in this booth,

and I am not dealing with that.

What's with the sad face?

You saw the bathroom?

It's just--even though
we fed the homeless,

it doesn't feel like
Thanksgiving without my father.

But you made a lot
of people happy here tonight,

and you should feel
pretty good about that.

- Yes, I do.
- Come on, elf.

We better clear these tables.

We have to be at Santaland
in an hour.

Why you have to be there
in the middle of the night?

Because it's Black Friday,
and the doors open at 5:00 A.M.

Yeah, we want to be there
right on time

to see the first person
trampled to death by UGGs.

We have to work

all night and then
all day tomorrow.

- How are we gonna do this?
- I got the answer right here.

Max, I'm not doing cocaine.

If we could afford cocaine,
we could afford a mixer.

Nine-hour energy shots,
aka elf juice.

I've never done these.
Do they work?

Millions of
wired-off-their-asses

college students
can't be wrong.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Did you just drink
that whole thing?

Yeah, why?

Nothing.

I'm sure it's not too much.

They suggest sipping it, but...

Who are they?

All right, we'd better go.

We got to go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

Oh, you should've sipped it.

How do I look?

Because I kind of feel like
I look like a North Pole dancer.

You actually look cute.
You look good in red...

And green--
red and green together.

You can pull off anything.
You're so beautiful.

- I don't tell you that enough.
- Whoa!

Whoa, slow down, speed racer.

I know. I can't stop talking.

What was in that stuff
you gave me?

I don't know.
The ingredients are in Spanish.

Well, my corazon
is beating muy rapido.

Okay, and why aren't you
in your elf costume yet?

Because I was talking
to those people over there,

and there's a chance--
a slight chance, but a chance--

I could get moved to the
strolling Christmas carolers.

I overheard their ethnic mix
is short a token blond.

And I'm blond, baby!

Forget it. You got me into
the underbelly of the elf beast,

and you are not bailing on me.

But those period costumes
are so much prettier.

I will knock you from here

to Rudolph's house
if you abandon me.

We are in this together.
Now go get your bells on.

Okay, I didn't want
to tell you this

because it's, well, gross,
but the last elf

who had the tights they gave me,
well, let's just say

her little lady elf friend
visited unexpectedly.

Ew.
Talk about a period costume.

You're right. It's disgusting.

I can't do this anymore.

I'm leaving. I don't want
to do this anymore.

I feel tired and wired
at the same time.

This was an awful, awful,
awful, awful, awful idea!

All right, calm down!

Jeez, you're like
a Christmas crack monkey.

Look, we are not going
anywhere, okay?

You got me all elfed up,
and now we need these jobs.

So just go talk to someone

and tell them why you need
a new pair of tights.

I can't. It's embarrassing.

Look, either you ask her,
or you rip out the crotch

and risk showing six-year-olds
your winter wonderland.

Now I'm sad.

You, the one
with the dark hair,

- I need you to come with me.
- Where?

And is there
a drug test involved?

Change of plans.
I need for you to be Mrs. Claus.

The other one had to leave--
blamed menopause.

Menopause, please.

I had my uterus yanked out
on my lunch hour,

and I was back
at my desk by 2:00.

Follow me...

Unless, uh, you don't want
that extra $2 an hour.

Oh, no. You are not leaving
me here alone

when I'm crashing on elf juice.

If I can't be
an old-timey singer,

you can't be Mrs. Claus.

Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm throwing you

under the sled, sister.

That extra $2 an hour
will bring us closer

to the really good mixer.

And the way my life is going,
this might be my only chance

to be married to a rich guy.

I'd double-check those tights
if I were you.

Ugh.

These tights suck.

Hi. Hi, elf.

I just got assigned to the front
of the line with you.

Oh, crap.

It's me, Mary.

"Mary Christmas."
You know, like...

- My brother Patrick always says.
- Yeah, you said that.

Look at how cute
we look...Jingles!

I just named you Jingles.

Get it?
'Cause of all your bells.

Oh, listen...

Ah, this is my number-one
favorite Christmas song.

Ooh! What's your favorite
Christmas song?

Silent night. Get it?
'Cause I want you to be silent.

What's the matter with you?

You're acting like an elfhole.

Oh, hello, children!

Who's next to see
my husband, Santa?

I am so mad at you right now.

Oh-ho-ho!

Uh, hold on, children.

Mrs. Claus is just
having an issue

with one of her elf employees.

What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

You abandon me on Christmas

the day after my father
abandons me on Thanksgiving?

You have balls.

Christmas balls...

Like on Santa's tree...

Or a Hanukkah bush.

Look, I've got
my own problems, okay?

Santa is kind of hands-y.

And you leave me here
with this one

when I'm coming down
the bad side

of nine-hour energy mountain?

I don't know what's
at the bottom, but so far,

not the miracle on 34th Street
I was hoping for.

- Well, elf--
- Her name is Jingles.

One more word, Mary, seriously.

Listen, Bipolar Express,

you need to jingle
all the way up that mountain,

because all these kids
are looking at us.

Hello!

- You got your list for Santa?
- Yep. Got it right here.

Well, he's waiting for you,
so go right ahead in.

- Yay, let's go!
- Hi.

Oh, you look so pretty
in your hat and your coat.

Thank you very much.

I used to have
a coat like that.

But she gave it to a reindeer
because he was very cold.

Oh, you have your list
for Santa?

Let's see what you want.

- Ooh, a pretty doll...
- Had it.

- An easy-bake oven...
- Had it.

- A Barbie dream house.
- Oh, had that, too.

Had all those things,
and now I have nothing--

- nothing to stick in my big hole.
- Okay.

- Jingles, what are you doing?
- Tell them, Max.

No, no. I'm not Max.
I'm Mrs. Claus--

Mrs. Beyonce Claus--

and I'm married to Santa.

No, tell them
what you told me--

that it's all just stuff we buy
to stick in our big holes.

I've been married for 50 years.

I don't even think
about holes anymore.

Why is she talking
to children about holes?

- I'll get her.
- Okay.

- Caroline--
- No, Max, you were right.

They should know the truth.

Mrs. Claus, have a little,
uh, elf control.

Jingles, come into
my little house.

No, Max. They should know.

There is no
miracle on 34th Street,

and it's not such a
wonderful life.

If it were,
I wouldn't be standing here

in crotchless tights
in the middle of Santaland,

with a father in prison,
too broke to buy a mixer.

Stop it, you're gonna
ruin Christmas.

Christmas is all about money.

If you want stuff from Santa,
you got to buy it,

because there is no--

Merry Christmas!

Get her out of here now.

And you, put your
knees together!

I hope I didn't ruin Christmas

- for all those sweet children.
- No, you didn't.

All they saw was
a crotchless elf freaking out.

But "Mary Christmas"
will never recover.

They'll find her in her
studio apartment in two weeks

hung from the chimney
with care.

Well, this is all
kind of your fault.

You told me to come
to the dark side.

I just told you to get
in touch with your feelings.

I didn't think you'd turn
into Darth Caroline.

Once I went there,
I couldn't get back.

Yeah, and chugging
that elf juice didn't help.

It wasn't just the drink.

Before those presents
came crashing down on me,

reality did.

I have no money
and a father in prison

who didn't even want to see me
on Thanksgiving.

Yeah, well, there are a lot of
people way worse off than you.

Yes, your father's in prison,

but at least you have one
and you know where he is.

And you have a home and a job.

And you have a freaking horse.

So...

Happy holidays.
It is a wonderful life.

You're right. I am so lucky.

Well, since right now is the
closest to the Christmas spirit

we're probably gonna get,

Santa wanted me to give you
your Christmas present now.

It's our new mixer.

We're gonna old-school it.

Aw, you spooned me.

I feel bad.
I didn't get you anything.

Max, you got me everything.

Before you, I was living
on a subway, and now look...

I'm living near a subway.

So did you buy this?

No, it's from Santa.

Jingles, did you steal this?

Yeah.

I grabbed it
when they were throwing us out.

Wow, Caroline Channing.

You keep this up, and you won't
have to ask permission

to visit your father in prison.

But I did give $2
of our cupcake-fund money

to the Salvation Army Santa.

So God bless us, everyone!
It's a wonderful life!

It's times like this
I really miss Darth Caroline.

Max! Over here at our white trash window.

I need help with shower.

All right, Chestnut we're
heading for work, soon.

You know the rules...

No R-rated movies, no sugary snacks and I
want you standing up and asleep by 11.

What's the problem?

I can't turn it on.

Well, drop your towel and
tell it has a big nozzle.

Did you even do a rat check?

Yes... Theodore is gone. Even
he got a better apartment.

Max, remind me... what separates
us from homeless people?

We're not as tanned?

Yeah, and we have a sometimes functioning
shower and that sweet shower curtain.

Hmm, which was gifted to us
by a homeless person

who no longer needed his cape.

That should do it.

Hey, why'd the sound stop?

That's weird.

Ah!

- All right. All right.
- Ugh.

Ugh.

Well, I got it turned on.

What's that, buddy?

It doesn't get any sadder?

Well, well, well, Caroline,

I didn't know it was "bring
your boyfriend to work" day.

Even our shower head is broke, Earl.

We got blasted with rusty water

and something thick.

Ugh, oh.

I feel so dirty.

Stop. We showered at Sophie and Oleg's.

That's why I feel dirty.

There was a rubber ducky
in there who looked like

he'd seen some really messed up stuff.

Look, we will do what we always do

when we need a new appliance
or a fishnet body stocking.

We'll ask Oleg.

Did somebody say fishnet body stocking?

Hey, everybody!

I'm going green,

and I don't just mean my eye shadow.

Yup, I'm getting my body
ready for pregnancy

with healthy eating
and less smoked meats.

I think going green is more
about the environment Sophie.

Oh, yeah?

And how many babies
have you had, Caroline?

Sophie, I wish I were that fetus.

I'm jealous of anything that

gets to be inside you for nine months.

You know, Oleg, since Sophie's
doing a food cleanse,

maybe you could do a cleanse
for your potty mouth.

I like that idea.

Since I'm changing for a
baby, you should too.

From now on, everything you
say should be G-rated.

Yeah, but the G doesn't stand for 'Gina.

So I'm supposed to serve bone-in
rib eye and pulled pork

and not make any comparison to my junk?

Well, I'll be over here
eating healthy in my booth.

Max, what are we gonna do
without a working shower?

Where will I cry?

And where will I hide from you?

Girls, if you need a shower,

there are wonderful
facilities at my new gym.

Well, they obviously have child care.

They even give me a 6:15
wake-up call every morning,

so I can make it to my
ideal body workout.

I'll give you a wake-up call right now.

Sleep in.

With that body, nothing's gonna work out.

Well, I have two "friends
and family" one-day passes

that I've been saving for my parents' trip

but last month they littered in Korea,

so they're in jail.

Hey, I found something green on here.

Two pistachio ice creams, please.

Sophie, I'm not sure I...

Just bring me something green, bitch.

Max, are you in here?

Ah, only lady here

has been in the shower a long time.

This isn't yours, is it?

Nope, and I'm guessing
it's not yours either.

It is now.

Girl,

why didn't you tell me a
shower could be this good?

I didn't think you'd believe me,

like when I told you they
make hangers just for pants.

Have you been in there this whole time?

I got out to pee a couple times.

Then I didn't get out
to pee a couple times.

While you were meeting
water for the first time,

I took three classes.

Body Rocket with Papo,

Flex Flow with Nat, and
Ab Attack with Abby,

and I just signed up for Celtic
Hip-Hop with Devandre O'Brien.

Yo, can you fit these
bad boys in your purse?

And, uh, don't forget my new hat.

I'll make room for them
next to the hand towels.

Ah, good for you, mami.

So I said to my nanny,

"Just take her to the emergency room.

"I cannot miss my workout with Brian

because Harlow ate a jar of Play-Doh."

FYI, bottomless shaving
cream in the shower.

Gave myself a Santa beard.

Hi, I wasn't listening in... all this tile,

your voices really carry.

Who's Brian, and what's
this amazing class

you're talking about?

YBBBB with Brian. Yoga Booty
Ballet Boxing and Beyond.

And it's beyond.

What studio is it in?

I'll go. Max?

There's no Max here!

One Ab Blast Immune Boost with banana.

Anyone else?

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Can a brother get some bee pollen?

Thank you, Brian.

Are you sure you haven't taken

Yoga Booty Ballet Boxing
and Beyond before?

'Cause it's like your booty
just instinctively knew

how to go beyond.

Oh, hello, Caroline, and you're Brian.

I've seen your trainer
photo on the wall.

I guess it wasn't
retouched as I assumed.

Brian, wait up.

Did you forget we're doing
30 days of sweaty selfies?

Can I buy you a juice?

And make out with you?

Joke, I'm kinda married.

Yeah.

Caroline, how about I
create a juice for you

that will optimize your workout?

Has he ever bought us a juice?

No, and we bought him a car.

Schiller, dude, give me a life boost.

Schiller, I'll have the
life boost as well.

Schiller.

Am I saying that right? Schiller.

Will you be in class tomorrow?

I'd love to see your flying lotus.

My lotus only has

a one-day pass, and it doesn't fly,

it takes the bus.

Not anymore.

I got us jobs at the juice bar.

We can take all the classes
and showers we want.

I told them I had juicing experience...

not a lie if you count the
week I dated Lance Armstrong.

Earl, this one shower,

the water comes at you from every angle,

and not because sewage is backing up.

You do seem happier, Max.

You're even kinda smiling.

How high are you right now?

No, I am totally clean.

Literally.

Showered Max is a pleasure to be around.

Also, she's much less itchy.

Hello, I'm a member
of Physique Total Body.

Swipe, swipe, swipe.

I love belonging to a place
where not everyone's allowed.

Hey, everybody!

No, it's not fitness nut Jane Fonda.

It's Sophie Kuchenski!

Yep, and everything about
me is healthy and green.

Hey, Sophie, since you're being green,

we brought you a Green
Genie from our gym.

Oh, you did?

Ah.

We don't really know what's in it.

We're not good at our jobs there either.

Aw, look at that. I'm
really proud of her, girls.

Suck it down, baby,
but not in a sexual way.

This is delicious.

I love it, yeah.

Ah. Oh.

I love this drink so much,

I'm gonna take it to the bathroom,

and I'm gonna love it in there.

Don't touch anything.

Hey, look. It's the Oldsen twins.

Did you tell them we worked here?

My diner uniform fell out of my gym bag,

and they didn't believe I was a
stewardess on Air Yugoslavia.

Hey, gym buddies.

We don't eat.

Well, you've come to the right place.

And thanks again for turning
me on to Brian's class.

I'm glad you like it, but... Jodie?

Yeah, you can't take it anymore.

So... yeah.

Why not?

Brian likes you,

which we totally don't understand,

but... Jodes?

Yeah.

We don't want to share him.

He's all we have.

So...

yeah.

You two are married with children.

Exactly. Brian is all we have.

We can make it really uncomfortable

for you at the gym,

and people are already talking

about your discount yoga pants.

So... yeah.

Oh, you're not the only person
in here who can be threatening.

Let me go get my threatening friend.

Max. Max, go over there and
give them the dagger eyes.

You know, the ones that
gave Han the twitch.

This one?

Uh, what is that?

No.

That's like a smile.

You don't smile. Cut it out.

Hey, ladies, look.

We don't know what that means.

So... yeah.

What? I'm trying,

but I guess showered Max
doesn't have it in her.

Oh... you know I'll say this girls

but don't quote me.

It ain't easy being green.

Now where's ginger?

Where's ginger?

I don't know, on that island

with Gilligan and the others?

And where's her Slim Down Smoothie?

In the blender.
Can you finish it?

This wheatgrass smell makes me sick.

Well, man up. I'm balls deep in
three gut busters over here.

Oh, God.

It smells like the Jolly
Green Giant's jock strap.

Oh, my God, it's like...

Stop. You gagging makes me gag.

Okay, almost done.

Slim Down Smoothie!

Kinda got away from me.

I won't charge you for the extra.

Um, I wanted banana in this.

Max, banana.

You wanted a banana. Banana.

Ugh. Where is Schiller to relieve me?

It's time for my YBBB class.

He probably got his hair caught

in the ab crunch machine again.

That damn crunch machine.

Okay, he's here. I'm out.

After class, you relieve me.

No dillydallying.

I got a hazard cone holding the shower

with the railing and the bench in it.

Ooh, nice earrings, Raquel.

Oh, Pav� diamonds.

Found them in a locker.

She doesn't need 'em.

Oh, you want this?

It's a fitness band.

Found it on the floor...

of a locker.

- Thanks.
- Mm.

Huh. They were not.

Hey, mami, I just heard
those two rich moms

trash-talking your friend.

Tell her to stay clear of Brian's class.

Their husbands are silent
partners in the gym,

and also, in their marriages.

Wait, are you telling me
I could lose my shower?

And your juice bar jobs.

Oh, right, that whole thing too.

I gotta stop her.

Feel that nice long stretch.

Can I help you?

Uh... someone reported a
dangerous, wet mess in here.

I don't see a wet mess.

Then you're not looking right here.

Go away. You're interrupting my flow.

Good, now try and hold it.
That's right, Caroline.

Okay, you feel that?

Let's get a nice big stretch.

That's big enough.

Miss, we're in the middle of a class.

And now let's all go into child's pose.

- Hey.
- Max.

Those moms are looking at you

like you put dressing on
their salad and mixed it in.

Very good. Your hips are remarkably open.

Thank you, Brian.

I can't lose that shower.

I finally found something
to make me feel good

that doesn't end in "arijuana."

Miss, you're stopping our flow.

That's exactly what I said, Brian..

YBBBB is a moving meditation,

so move it on out of here.

Why you gotta BBBB so rude?

Namaste.

And, you, Namaste away from him.

I'm back. See? Nothing happened.

Those two moms didn't do anything.

I mean, how dangerous can they be?

They're almost 40

40? That's almost 50.

Great class.

I felt quite the burn.

How about I buy you ladies
each a Sex on the Peach?

Great, just not from her.

Han, what's so funny?

Caroline... rumor has it you
let one fly in yoga class.

Max, what's Han saying?

You tooted. Floated an air biscuit.

Pass-ah the gas-ah.

Still need me to clarify?

Okay, hi, um, to be clear,

I didn't do what they said. I wouldn't.

If I had, I would have
already thrown myself

down a StairMaster.

You mess with the bull,

you get the fart rumor.

Oh, my God, those 60-year-old women

started a fart rumor about me.

At least they didn't get us fired.

Ah, phew. Ha, no pun intended.

Hey, Brian, great class.

Wanna design a juice for me?

Kinda busy right now.

I got a recently divorced dad looking to

get back out there in a big way.

Plus, you farted.

I can't believe this is happening.

I'm being shunned in public
for something I didn't do.

It's my father's Ponzi
scheme all over again.

From now on, I'm Caroline,
the gas-ah pass-ah.

Look, I know you're in a fart spiral,

but their husbands own this place,

so don't do anything to ruin
this sweet situation for us.

Sorry, Max, but I never told off
those Upper East Side ladies

for how they treated me five years ago,

so I'm gonna have to let these
two rich bitches have it.

Oh, no.

Just because you're in
sad, loveless marriage...

We couldn't even hear you,

so... yeah.

I'll be happy to repeat every word.

Oh, man.

My fitness band slid off!

I broke the Mega Juicer 5000.

You know why they call
it a Mega Juicer 5000?

'Cause it costs 5000.

We know. We bought one for Brian.

I think you just got fired, mami.

Oh, here's a good-bye gift.

Another fitness band.

Raquel, will you tell
the shower with the bench

that I love him?

Oleg, how's it going in there?

I'm ready to screw it in.

Said with zero sexual innuendo.

Here. How lucky are we that Raquel found

this shower head in the locker?

I burned 515 calories walking home.

Oh, that's the time.

Still, nothing to sneeze at.

Who needs a fancy gym?

Oleg's here right now to
take care of our hole.

Okay, now you're doing it on purpose.

Anybody wanna go grab a
lettuce wedge at Wedgies?

There she is, my vegan vixen.

Just look at that healthy glow.

Mmm.

Mmm.

Sugar.

That's not a glow. It's a glaze.

I had a doughnut.

Yeah, it fell on my face.

I had to eat it, or I
would suffocate to death.

I've been on my best behavior,

and you're not holding up your end,

which, for some godforsaken reason,

I'm not even allowed to comment on!

Oh, maybe we could have a cheat day,

and that day could be...

today?

Pound cake? Know what I'd like to pound?

Oh, I sure do.

Mmm.

What are we waiting for?


Max, guess who's
getting a divorce.

Please tell me it's us.

Nope, we'll be together
way past when we should be.

Like The Rolling Stones.

It's Jason and Winona Williams.

Wow, I really thought
those two were gonna make it.

We're talking about those two
sisters who play tennis, right?

Never heard of them,
but there are a lot

of famous people
I've never heard of.

Like that guy who's on TV
sometimes and he's always like,

(babbles)
"Blah, blah, I'm on TV."

Yeah, that's Bill Maher.

Anyway, they're rich,
globe-trotting socialites,

and they want to throw a party
at our dessert bar

to celebrate the collapse
of their marriage.

They celebrate divorce now?

My mom missed out
on, like, 12 parties.

They're coming tomorrow
to see the place, so maybe don't

wear your "Team Satan" T-shirt.

Why, 'cause there's
a stain on it?

No, this could be
a $5,000 job, Max.

I was offered
a $5,000 job once.

I said, "No way."

Come to think of it,
that was Bill Maher.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Hey, look,

it's Saddington Bear.

Oof, unlike torrential rain,

this jacket does not
repel insults.

I have to go check the drains.

Oh, if you find
my love life down there,

bring it back to me.

Han, the hurricane
ain't coming, man.

My body always knows when
a disaster is on its way.

It predicted the '97 El Niño

and my third wife, Diane.

That's true,
and when he gets chest pains,

it means it'll be
partly cloudy.

No, that's a heart attack.

Shortness of breath
means partly cloudy.

Pardon me if I don't
just blindly trust Earl.

He voted for Richard Nixon,

this year.

Man, he's gonna get us
out of Vietnam.

Well, I'm not taking
any chances.

This may come as a shock to you,

but this diner is all I have!

Not true.

You also have
tiny arms and legs.

Oh, look, a Minion.

Hey, everybody!

Look, it's me,
my Barbara, and my manny.

Yeah, Oleg and I

hired him to help
with Baby Babs.

You know, in Poland,

a manny has to have
his penis removed.

Yeah.

But here, he gets to keep it!

I'm Max, this is my
first time meeting a manny.

I mean, a lot of men watched me
when I was a teenager,

but they paid me.

Shane!

I'm not just paying you
to stand around.

Well, at least burp one of us.

Isn't that the sweetest?

My wife, my baby,

and the man with a lady's job.

You're not nervous
your manny is, you know,

extremely good-looking,

and you're, well...

Hung?

He's not good-looking.

His eyebrows don't even
meet in the middle.

Sophie didn't want
to hire a woman because

I walk around naked a lot,

and I'm, well...

The grossest?

A stink machine?

Girls, my wife is here.

Stop flirting with me.

Max, are you gonna
go out with Shane?

Because he's staring at you.

Unless he's trying really hard
to read that sign.

Uh, I'm already
in a relationship

with Randy, remember him?

'Bout yay tall, yay wide,
yay long.

I know how "yay long."
It's your screensaver.

But, uh, didn't you guys
break up?

(incredulous laugh)

(scoffs)

You are so naive, mi amigo.

This is all part
of me and Randy's dance.

I say we should break up,

and he says
it's definitely over,

so we're still
very much together.

I know I've been out
of the game awhile,

but that makes less sense

than dress Crocs.

I didn't ask your opinion
when I bought them,

and I'm not asking for it now.

And this is
the part of the dance

where he shows up
and surprises me.

Damn it,
I should have worn my Crocs.

(laughs)

Awful news!

I was unable to fix the drains!

Turns out,

we don't have any!

We need to protect ourselves.

I'll be outside,
filling sandbags.

Anyone who wants to help,
follow me.

No one's behind me,
are they?

Nope, just the shadow
of a child holding a lantern.

Oh, you know what, Shane?

I'm bored.

Now, come on,
let's go back to the apartment.

And you can walk on my back
while Barbara naps.

You know, like mannies do.

Bye.

Let's go!

(upbeat rock music)

Where are Jason and Winona?

They need to get here
before the storm does

and my hair frizzes.

Well, Randy better get here
before the storm too.

(cell phone chimes)
Ooh, this could be him!

(scoffs)
Damn it.

The one time I don't
want a text from Chili's.

Although they're
practically giving away

these sizzling fajitas.

CAROLINE: (gasps)

Jason and Winona!
You made it.

I was worried
something horrible happened,

like you got
caught in the storm

or you got back together!

(both laugh)

I think it has to be
below zero

for hell to freeze over.

And we should know.
We've been to the Arctic.

He murdered a penguin.

It was an accident!

If it was the penguin
from Happy Feet,

you'll pay for that
with your life, my friend.

That's Max.

She thinks cartoon characters
are real.

I'm Caroline Channing.

And she thinks
Matthew McConaughey

actually loves driving
a Lincoln.

Why would he endorse that?
He doesn't need the money.

End of story.

Ugh.
This place is so cute.

Almost as cute

as the mud hut in Borneo
where I realized

I didn't love you.

That was five years ago.

Okay, maybe save that
for the toast?

Here's some of the themed drinks
we're working on.

Almost Single Malt Scotch.

Resent-Mint Chocolate Chip
Cookie Shooters.

Still debating the

"Tequila" Him Would Have
Been Easier shots.

(wind whooshes)

Oh, hate to break
this meeting up,

but I think my boyfriend's here.

(wind whooshes)

Yeah, he doesn't like
to bother me when I'm working.

Well, maybe I should get going
before the weather gets too bad.

I have a date I should have
gone on five years ago.

Oh, I bet it's not even raining.

(thunder rumbling)

See?
Just a little sprinkle.

You wear a bra?

The hurricane is headed
right for Williamsburg.

Fedoras are
blowing down the streets.

Craft beers
are spilling everywhere.

And indie bands
are cancelling practice.

Sorry, girls,
I guess Shakira was wrong.

My hips do lie.

This explains why
Randy isn't here yet.

He's probably
stuck in the storm.

Max, you're being delusional.

And I know that
because I'm delusional.

Han, I have to get home.

Sophie's alone with the manny

and she gets turned on
by bad weather.

It's true.

Last time it snowed,
we made out a little bit.

Her favorite porno
is The Perfect Storm,

even with Diane Lane's
horrible Boston accent.

Oleg, no, it's too dangerous.

Yeah, it is.
Han, go with him.

(lighting crackling)

Even the wind pushes Oleg away.

(lightning crackling)

(panting)

That's my worst experience
being blown

since I got caught
in the hand dryer

in the ladies' washroom.

(electricity sputters)

Oh, no.
Everyone into the walk-in.

Ugh.

Well, I guess we're stuck here.

Another hostage situation.

Just like our honeymoon.

JASON: Oh, you loved Tehran.

(lightning crackling)

CAROLINE: So do you guys
want to see a sample menu?

Max, light a match
so they can see.

MAX: Give me a sec.
I'm looting the register.

Sorry, it's a reflex.

*

*

Should we eat all the food
before it expires?

Two years ago.

This is the safest place
in the building.

This used to be
my gift-wrapping suite.

I mean, man cave.

Am I sitting on
a sack of potatoes?

Nope.
Just my prostate.

So sorry for the inconvenience.

Can I offer you
some pinto beans?

A tub of slaw?

Mouse skeleton?

Well, it does remind me
of that time in the rainforest

when we stole that tribe's food

and they hung us up
from our genitals.

WINONA: Oh, yeah.

Oh, you looked so cute that day.

-(chuckles)
-All upside down and screaming.

Stop.
(both giggling)

"Upside down and screaming"?

Oh, that's it.

I'm FaceTiming Sophie
to make sure

her storm door
is sealed shut.

(phone trills, hums)

Sophie.

For once I'm grateful
you have all your clothes on.

Although...

stay focused, Oleg.

Hey, Oleg.

Yeah, we're fine, I was just
reading Barbara her horoscope.

Now she's about to find out
who her true friends are.

Yeah, oh, and tell the girls
that we brought Chestnut in.

"We"?

What happened to his shirt?

Chestnut's?

Well, I took it off.
He was warm.

No, Sophie, the manny.

His nipples are staring at me.

Well, what do you think
happened to it?

He spilled his wine--
hey, Oleg, I gotta hang up.

We gotta close the windows.
It's a perfect storm out there.

SOPHIE: Yeah, I think I am
gonna get up there

on that horse
bareback with you.

(call disconnects)

"Perfect storm"?

Oh, no, this is terrible.

There's wine.
There's a storm.

There's a horse in the mix.

The sexual possibilities
are dizzying!

Wine?

Ooh, that reminds me.

Oh, sorry.
We're out of wine.

Who wants a
Capri Sun and vodka?

(laughs)
Scratch that.

Who doesn't want
a Capri Sun and vodka?

What am I gonna do?

I have travel Scattergories
in my emergency backpack.

Perhaps we roll
an F for fun?

Perhaps we roll you outside
for fun?

Oof, so much for the community
coming together during a crisis.

Oh, what's the bathroom policy
around here?

Just go anywhere?

(lightning crackling)

(electricity sputters)

Oh, no, no,
this is not good.

My diner is more screwed
than Sophie right now.

Too soon?

(electrical clank)

CAROLINE: (yelps)
Hold me!

HAN: Just so you know,

that is a flashlight
in my pocket.

*

(thunder rumbling)

Are we gonna talk about
what happened?

Max, please tell me
they make

really, really small
flashlights

that move on their own.

Do you want me to lie to you

or do you want me to tell you
that was Han's penis?

Wow.

Caroline and Han are
really getting at it over there.

This storm is
turning people on

more than alcohol
and low self-esteem.

Even Han got some action.

I don't hold hands and tell.

Or maybe I do.
This is kind of a first.

I could tell.

Your thumb was
all over the place.

I hope that was your thumb.

That's it.

I can't risk Sophie being alone

with the Elephant Manny
any longer.

Even a 2 like him looks like
a 5 in this bad weather,

and Sophie has a thing
for 5s.

If I die, Max,

you know what strippers
I want at my funeral.

Yep, same ones
I want at mine.

I want Bagpipes
at my funeral.

She'll be expecting
your call.

The sexual tension
is rising.

This is turning into a real
"will we or won't we?"

We won't.

We can't!

(both panting)

You know what I've
always wanted to do?

Have a "getting back together"
party?

Same price,
less Adele on the playlist.

No.

You know.
We should...

BOTH: Drive through Syria!

-(laughs)
-(squeals)

Syria?

Is that a new
Middle Eastern fast-food place?

(blows raspberry)

Baba ghano-thank-you.

Syria sounds beautiful.

Let us throw
your going-away party.

And birthdays coming up?
Graduations?

Quinceañeras?
Just 'cause?

Why almost die in Syria

when we could be
out there right now

almost dying in a hurricane?

Oh, there's the woman
my family forced me to marry.

Every second we're in here
is second we're not

risking getting electrocuted
by downed power lines.

We'll see you guys later.

(hearty laugh)

Wha--
we do funerals.

Wakes, shivas, too.

Tell your captors.
(door shuts)

Unbelievable.

I'm so bad at relationships,

I can't even
make a divorce work.

I'll give you some pointers.

First rule, have sex
with her big-mouthed sister.

I'm gonna see if Randy
posted anything on Snapchat

about his travels.

I know what you're thinking,
and you're wrong.

He is not in LA,
enjoying the sunshine.

Hey, I'm here in sunny LA,

just about to take
my dog for a walk.

You know, people are saying
we're starting to look alike.

RANDY: Thoughts?

Because to tell you the truth,
I don't really see it.

Although I have been

peeing on fire hydrants
more than usual.

You know what?
(blows raspberry)

I am calling him.

He wants me to.

You saw the look on his snout.

You're acting more mixed-up
than me.

And yesterday I ordered
a cheeseburger from an ATM.

And I gotta say,
it wasn't bad.

He's not answering, and it's
going straight to voicemail.

(gasps)
Maybe Snapchat got it wrong

and he's on a plane.

He probably blocked you.

Right, baby?

Give me your phone.

(line trilling)
RANDY: Hello?

(phone hums)
It went through and he answered.

'Cause it wasn't my phone.
He did block me.

Max, I'm sorry.

We're really broken up.

Don't feel too bad.

From what I saw,
he had kind of a dog face.

Ooh-ooh.

My hips think that

the storm is over, y'all.

Why don't you go
check for flooding, old man?

Just like you did for Noah.

Sorry, that's the cockiness
of my new relationship talking.

We should all go.

None of us have anything left
to live for anymore anyway.

Uh, excuse me,
I have plenty--

okay, you're right, let's go.

*

*

Yes!
Yes, it's okay.

Wow.

I guess the hurricane
looked us up on Yelp

and stayed the hell away.

It survived the storm!

My diner's alive.

Yeah, parts of it have
chased me around the kitchen.

I love how you're funny.

The storm is gone.
My body got it right.

Now, if it could only
pump blood on its own.

Great.

Oleg survived too.

(blows raspberry)
This hurricane sucked.

I made it home,

but Sophie and the manny
were gone.

And I could tell by the look
in Chestnut's eyes

and the wine on his mane
that they're not coming back.

Oh--Oleg,
you're here!

Sophie,

you're here.

Oh, I was so worried.
What happened?

To my churro?

Well, yeah, it got wet.

Oh, Oleg,

I didn't want to be
in the hurricane without you.

And I didn't want
anyone to be in you

without me.

Oh.

Don't be silly.
We're family now.

Plus, the storm
got me all horned up.

Confession:

I'm not just wet
from the storm.

Oh, my God,

does this guy always know
what to say or what?

Oh, Oleg,
let's go home.

I love happy endings.

Oh, well,
if Barbara's sleeping,

I might be able to
give you one on the way home.

Caroline,

we need to talk about
what happened in there.

Okay, but do I have to be here?

Look, I've been thinking
that sometimes

crazy weather makes
you do crazy things.

Yeah, I just listened to
Sophie and Oleg talk

for like an hour.

I--I guess what
I'm trying to say is

we're Dones-ville.

Han.

Shh.

No, no.

Don't beg.

This is hard enough
as it is.

But...

keep that chin up.

You'll find someone.

I recommend the Internet.

Thanks, Han.

It was fun while
it never started.

Max, I hate
seeing you like this.

You know what?

Maybe Randy only
blocked you because--

Because he didn't want to
ruin the surprise of him

coming here to see me?

All right.
Yep. Sure.

I'm gonna check
his Snapchat again.

Not now, Max.
Let's go hug our dessert bar.

It was probably so scared.

Hey!
I'm running 'cause I'm late.

Gotta get to New York--

(gasps)
Great, his story cut off.

But you were right!

I was?

Ooh, it unfroze.

Philharmonic
at the Hollywood Bowl.

Well, that's it.

He's not coming to New York.

I have to face reality.

He's bowling in LA
with his buddy Phil.

*

(gasps)

Oh, my God!

Cray, right?

I didn't even know
Randy liked bowling.

No, Max, look!

Is that tree new or
has it always been there?

I know the condom
stuck to it hasn't.

The diner is fine,
but our beautiful dessert bar

gets hit by the hurricane?

But...

your hair looks good
right now.

Just "good"?

I'm calling Han.

I weirdly feel like
I need him now.

It's going
straight to voicemail.

(gasps) Han!
I was just trying to call you.

Yeah, I blocked you.

I just can't go there
right now.

Caroline, don't cry.

We have insurance.
Right?

I don't listen to 100%
of what you say.

We'll be fine.

I just think
blocking a person is mean.

Okay, Chestnut,
it's time to play that game

where we take shots
while we pay our bills

that Max so cleverly named,
"that game where we take shots

while we pay our bills."

Hey, if you want me
to think of a better name,

we should probably stop taking shots

while we pay our bills.

If this bill says first warning,

we take a shot, and
Chestnut gets a carrot.

If it's a final notice,

Chestnut gets two carrots,
and we take a double shot.

And if it's gone into collections,

we shoot ourselves, and
Chestnut gets three carrots.

And also, I'm gonna take shots
whenever I want to.

All right, only a couple bills to go

and $149 to pay them.

That's an odd number.
Shots!

Man, our electric bill is $72.

That's an even number.
Shots!

Next up, I have gas.

Ah, thanks for the heads-up this time.

We have $77, and the bill's only $76.84.

Numbers!
Shots!

This is the first time
we've ever broken even.

Wait, what do we do when we break even?

Shots?

I'm so proud we paid all our bills

and with actual
American dollars this time.

There might've been a
couple of pesos in the mix,

that or the nickel
has a sweet new donkey.

Look, girls, I got the new iPhone,

and Siri thinks I'm hilarious.

I hear that phone
has a great camera for selfies.

Or, in your case, elfies.

Smile, Max.

Nice.
#willdiealone.

Oh, already got a like.

Hey, everybody.

Big news.

I finally met the man of my dreams.

Sophie, that's not news.
You've known me for years.

Oh, Earl, another place,

another time, another woman,

another man.

Hey, girls, you better
wipe down my booth.

My boyfriend's parking
his Lincoln outside.

Yeah, he dropped me off
first 'cause he's a class act

and 'cause he had
to put his pants back on.

There she is.
There's my Peanut.

You hear that?
He calls me his Peanut.

Holy crap, she's looking even prettier

than the last time I saw her.

What'd you do,

get some beauty creams
on the way from the car

to the diner?

Oh, maybe.

Sophie, it's nice to see you
so giddy about something.

Yeah, you're like me
sitting on that broken washer

at the laundromat.

I'm Nicky, but my friends call me

when they need money.

I'm Caroline.
This is Max.

I'm gonna ask you the same question

I ask every guy around your age.

Are you my dad?

Maybe one of you dolls can get me

a glass of water to wash down my tums?

Sexy and he has an ulcer.

Sure, I'll go get you some
menus and the wine list.

Don't get excited.

That's just a list of everything

Caroline's whined
about in the last year.

What's up with
Robert de Zero over there?

I used to have a
leather jacket like that.

Then I realized, when you have
the right to bear arms,

You bare them, baby.

Omelet. Pick up.

I think Oleg just got jealous.

I think Oleg just got
underarm dandruff in these eggs.

Enjoy.

Here are your menus,

and we're out of everything
in the pictures since 1974.

So the little girl
smiling eating a waffle,

she's a grandma now,
and she calls Penn Station home.

Here you go, dolls, for your trouble.

100 bucks?
It's like free money.

Can you imagine
what he would've given us

if the glasses were clean?

All this money
and I didn't even do anything.

I'm one mustache away
from being a Kardashian.

Yeah, Nicky's a big-shot bookie

with a Yorkie and a membership

to the VIP lounge at the race track.

A Yorkie and a green leather jacket?

Are you even real?

I love horse racing.

I used to go to the track all the time,

and not to brag,
but I do own a Thoroughbred.

Oh, yeah, she does.

I see it eating out of the garbage can
from my window.

Here, that's Chestnut.

That's a beauty,
but not as much a beauty

as my Peanut right here.

Oh, he just compared me to a horse,

but I like it anyway.

Why don't you two dolls join us

at the track's turf club some afternoon?

Oh, we're busy,
and it's all the way out in...

Are you paying?

Of course.

Oh, then we're there.

In fact, can we go right now?

Yeah, we're not doing anything.

Max, look, the turf club.

Us way up here,

the horses down there on the track

being forced into their starting gates.

This is so exciting.

Girl, we've been here 30 seconds,

and you already blew your bugle.

Pace yourself.

Max, Caroline,

over here!

Wow, I haven't seen Sophie this happy

since that girl slipped on the ice
in front of our building.

That girl was me, Max,

and I really hurt my coccyx.

You have a coccyx?
You want to go out sometime?

Hey, girls.

Come on, Peanut.
Get a little closer to me.

Closer. Little closer.

Closer. Little closer.

What can I say, girls?
I can't get close enough.

Do you hear that?
He can't get close enough.

Thank you so much for inviting us.

It feels great to be
back at the track again.

Ah, horse racing is, after all,

the sport of kings.

I'm more interested in the sport

of king crab legs right over there.

So is this an
all-you-can-eat deal here,

Or will a waiter come drag me away?

Knock yourself out.

How much could
a girl like you possibly eat?

You know how a cobra
can swallow an entire pig?

It's like that.

Hey, Caroline, you want two or three?

So Max tells me you met
at 24 hour fitness 24 hours ago.

Yup, he spotted me in a handstand.

Nicky, who am I gonna bet on?

Who do you like, besides me?

Sophie, go with Mess in a Dress.

She had great morning sprints,

first-time blinkers,

jockey weighed in a pound under,

and at the preakness,

she was second in seven furlongs,

and this race is only six furlongs.

Yeah, you're talking for long.

Yeah, I think I'm gonna
go with number three,

My Uncle Hank.

My Uncle Hank?

He's out of jail?

Yeah, we should probably
eat this and head out.

Oh, see, that's my horse.

My horse, Uncle Hank.

And look, see?
He just pooped.

He's trying to get away from it.

I know about that.
That's how I am.

Okay, got to make the donuts, but first,

give me that kisses, sister.

Aw, so romantic.

Max, maybe we should
get in on the action.

Nah, that's a lot of tongue for me.

No, I meant place a bet.

And, Max, I think I'm in a three-way.

Well, you look exactly
the way I imagined

you'd look in a three-way.
Reading.

Come on, we have that free money,

and you love to gamble.

Yeah, but nothing stupid,
just, like, not using a condom.

Oh, what the hell?

Wait, wait, Nicky, Nicky, here.

Here's your money.
200 on Mess in a Dress.

Oh, wait, I think
I have a mess in my dress.

You got it, doll, and I'm sending over

some of those special popovers.

Sophie, make sure you get one.

Oh, do you hear that?

There's gonna be a ring
in one of those popovers.

I didn't hear any of that.

Well, why else would
someone order popovers

Unless they were gonna
hide a ring in it?

I just ate the entire
cast of Finding Nemo.

I'm not saying I'm sick.

I'm just saying
that clown fish wants out.

Afternoon, ladies.
Enjoy the popovers.

And are you finished with that?

Ah, let's just say
it's finished with me.

And they're off.

This is so exciting.

I know.
I wonder which one it's in.

Oh. Oh, not that one.

All right.
Whoops, not that one.

Look, look, there's our horse,

Mess in a Dress.

She's in the lead.

Oh, no, not that one.

Yes, yes, yes.

No, no, no.

And the winner is Mess in a Dress.

We won! We won.

Are we being winners right now?

I don't know how to be that.

Suddenly I don't know
what to do with my hands.

Nothing.

I mean, who in the hell
would order popovers

And not hide a diamond ring in it?

Here you go, dolls.
6 big ones.

Max, this is incredible.

We had 200, and now we have 600.

Even more free money.

And, waiter, bring my Peanut

one of those banana splits.

You hear that?

There's a diamond ring in the bottom

of the banana split.

And, Leon, for your trouble.

Really? 100?

Yup, I was a waitress
before I was rich.

And also after that fish,

I might need you to
carry me to the subway.

Whoever that is going through my pants,

you should know I have a gun.

Max, it's me, Caroline.

Why do you think I bought the gun?

Okay, Max, you know how today

we won 600 on our 200
after just that one horse race?

Yeah, that was weird,
but not as weird

as waking up to see
you standing in the dark

going to third base with my pants.

If I bet our winnings
with the three-to-one odds

on this horse tomorrow,

Do you know
how much I can make us?

Let's see. 2, carry the 1...

Get out.

I have the racing form right back here.

Don't bring that over here.
That's been in your crack.

See? Right here.

First race tomorrow.
There She Blows.

If she's blowing that
early in the morning,

she deserves our money.

I've done all the research

and checked it with Chestnut.

It's a sure thing, like
the sun coming up tomorrow

Or that Somali pirate

never getting another acting job again.

You go out and get addicted
to horse racing

after I worked so hard

to put pills and weed on the table?

I am not addicted.

Now, where's your cash?

'Cause it wasn't in your piggy bank,

which someone, not me, broke.

You think you don't have a problem?

Then, fine, you can have the money.

You won't be sorry.
Where is it?

In my bra.

Where's your bra?

On my boobs.

You sleep in your bra?

Have to.
Last time I let them out at night,

they didn't come home till 4 A.M.

and couldn't tell me where they'd been.

Max, just take it out of there, please.

Nope, I'll tell you
what I tell every guy

who wants to get in there.

It's 12 bucks for adults
and 10.50 for seniors.

Fine, I'm doing this for both of us.

Still think you don't have a problem?

Geez, where is it?

Is there a map or a tour guide?

Coming up on your left.
You're about 20 minutes away.

It's quite a walk.
You might want to take the tram.

Got it.

Feel good about yourself?

I will after that race tomorrow.

And I promise I'll never do that again.

That's what my Uncle Hank said.

No, I meant I'll never
ask you for money again.

That's what Uncle Hank's wife said.

No more gambling.

Now I feel like you read
the transcript of Uncle Hank's case.

Oh, wait, you forgot some.

Just kidding, it's late,
and it felt kind of good.

Max, I hope Caroline gets here soon,

'cause if that girl walks
in one full hour late,

I'll have to respect
the hell out of her.

She's still at the track,

and I'm dying to know
how our horse did.

So much suspense.

I feel like I should
be peeing on a stick.

You girls are still playing the horses.

Keep that in check.

My gambling problem got so bad

I couldn't even afford my drug problem.

You're back!
So how did we do?

We did great.

We won our bet on There She Blows.

Yes! How much did we get?

Are we talking "add avocado" money?

Well, we did do great,
and then we did not great.

And then we did bad,
and then we did real bad.

And then we did terrible.

Long story short, I'm out of tums,

and we owe Nicky $3,000.

You... You owe Nicky.

When I got addicted to Pizza Pringles,

I didn't make it your problem.

Your breath made it all our problems.

Max, Nicky's not,
like, dangerous, is he?

I bet he's not, but even if he is,

Don't worry.

You can survive in the trunk of a Lincoln
for five, six days easy.

Max, I know I can make
all of this money back

If I just win one more race.

I just need a sure thing.

There is no such thing as a sure thing,

Except my mother
never picking me up from school.

Look, there are two horses tomorrow

that look really good,

Buck That and Little House on the Gary.

Little House on the Gary.
That's my friend Eddie's horse.

We don't have time to pretend

you have a friend named Eddie right now.

I do. Eddie Jones.

He's a famous jockey.
We met at the tailor.

We got to talking as we were both
having our jeans hemmed.

Where'd you buy them, JC Puny?

Han, please, you have to help me.

You have to talk to your friend Eddie

and get me the scoop
on the race tomorrow.

Okay, I'll help on one condition:

No more short jokes from Max.

She can do that.

You can do that, right, Max?
Don't answer.

So no more short jokes
starting right...

Okay, wait, but first,

Didn't I see you on a baby food jar?

A mouse set a trap for you.

And don't you
have to bring a ring to Mordor?

Okay, let's do this.

Eddie said he'd meet us down here.

Han, I really appreciate this.

You're doing me such a big, big favor.

Yeah, and we're surprised
you can do anything big.

Okay, that's it.

Han, wait.

I don't need it!

Max, see what you did?

What? I was on autopilot.

What did I say?

Han, please, Max won't say anything.

Good, 'cause I've had it up to here.

You don't have it up to there.

Don't need it!

Max!

Please, you have to stop
with the short jokes.

This is my life.

But that's my life.

Keep it up, and I'm gonna be
at the bottom of the East River

with that hipster artisan cheese truck

you pushed off the Brooklyn Bridge.

You're right.
No more short jokes.

Maybe I should wait outside.

So, Han, where's Eddie?

I think we should talk to him

as quickly as possible
before Max passes out.

I don't see him.
I'm sure he'll be here shortly.

And I just bit the inside of my mouth.

Hey, it's Han!

I haven't seen you since
we took our little trip.

No, man, I saw you
after my small business

on a softball game.

Hey, I got new car, a Mini Cooper.

This is hell. I'm in hell.

Eddie, hi.
Is there anything you can tell me

about today's race?

Is there a sure thing?

Oh, you get yourself a bad bet?

Bad bet and beyond.

Well, let me give you a little tip.

I'll be outside.

And coming down the home stretch,

Little House on the Gary
has the lead.

Come on, Little House on the Gary!

Run! Run like Caroline after sundown

in an ethnic neighborhood.

The Hoof, The Hoof, The Hoof is on fire!

He's winning. He's winning.

He's winning!

Oh, no, what's happening?

He's falling behind.

Oh, Lord. Oh, my sweet, sweet Lord.

He's losing. He's losing.

He's losing.
Han, what is happening?

Well, maybe I'll take off.

Your friend said it was a sure thing.

There is no sure thing

except another
Taylor Swift breakup song.

And Little House on the Gary

falls to pieces
as Falls to Pieces wins.

So what do we win
if our horse finishes last

and wanders around
the track with a giant erection?

All that and we lost?

Thanks for lunch.

Han, you're so small
your house is a tic tac box.

You're so small you ride
in your car cupholder.

You're so small your parents
are a ladybug and a tater tot.

I could see that, actually.

I don't need it!

You see, Caroline?

This is why I quit gambling,

this and the escalator
was always broken.

All right, let's just calm down.

This is the turf club, not Goodfellas,

Though that was placed
on real-life events

and took place not that far from here.

Right, and maybe
he won't be so hard on us.

Nicky is Sophie's boyfriend.

Well, I just broke up with Nicky.

Why?

I just saw him beat the crap

out of some guy that owed him money.

Oh, no, here he comes.

There you are, dolls.

My leg is next.

Tough break.

I'm gonna take my 3 grand and go.

Peanut just broke up with me,

so I'm gonna go home and get in bed

with my dog and my wife.

I have to come clean.
We don't have your money.

I got out of control.

Doll, relax.
I'm a reasonable man.

We can work out something.

Oh, good.

Hope he shoots me first.

I'd rather be dead than hear you beg.

Still got that thoroughbred?

I'll come by tomorrow to get it.

He can't take my horse.

What am I gonna do?

You can always move to New York
and change your name to Max.

Wait, I already did that.

What is wrong with me?

I should have known better.

My father has problems with money.

It's in my DNA.

And now all because of a stupid bet,

I'm gonna lose Chestnut.

If it makes you feel any better,

my mom once lost me in a bet.

Still can't believe she thought

Robert Redford was in Tootsie.

We can't lose Chestnut.

Damn it, damn it, damn it, people.

Make me come out of retirement

Just save your gambling asses.

Now, all I need is 100 bucks.

Hey, Caroline, how fast
can you have a baby?

Hey. Hi, Leon.

Remember us, the ones
who tipped you 100 bucks?

Oh, of course, it's hard to find

that kind of generosity in this place.

It gives you hope again.

Yeah, we're gonna need that back.

Well, actually, I need all my money.

I support my mother.

Yeah, maybe not today.

Max, I can't believe it.

I screwed me and the horse I rode in on.

Why don't you film that
and get your money back?

Caroline, look.

Earl, you did it. You saved Chestnut.

Yeah, well, we brown studs

have to stick together.

And I'll take that.

And since I don't trust myself,

I'm donating this 200
to my favorite charity,

So here.

Now, no more betting,

'cause the only sure
thing in life is death.

Have a nice day.

One for you, and one for me.

200, we're back to our free money,

And this time, it's going
right in the savings account.

Well, it's not earning
much interest in there.

Here.

We're keeping this in a bank

with two major branches.

Synced and corrected by backinblack


Pick up!
Tables 12, 4, 11.

Got it.

Hey,
when you get a second,

stop looking at my boobs.

Excuse me.

Waitress?

Dude?

Hi, what can I get ya?

We need some...

Is that annoying?

Is that
obnoxious and rude?

Would you find it distracting
if someone did that to you

while you were working?

Oh, you don't have a job.
Sorry.

Damn, dude,
she burned you.

Oh.

No, hipster.

Do not think we're on the same
team. We have nothing in common.

I wear knit hats
when it's cold out.

You wear knit hats
'cause of coldplay.

You have tattoos
to piss off your dad.

My dad doesn't know
he's my dad.

You think...

This is the sound
that gets you service.

I think...

This is the sound
that dries up my vagina.

The other waitress
disappeared, the Russian one.

We need horseradish.

Please.

That, ladies,
is how you treat a waitress.

Paulina!

Oh, so... so good, oh...

Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
you were on break.

I just need
some horseradish.

- Here.
- Oh, cool.

Excuse me,
where's my waitress?

She's coming.

Earl.

Earl!

I made your favorite,
red velvet.

My little cupcake
brought me a cupcake.

Oh, no, no.
It's on the house.

It's your birthday.

How old are you gonna be?

75.

Oh, Earl, if you were just
three years younger.

Max, Max, big news.

The new boss fired
that Russian waitress, Paulina.

Turns out Chesty Kournikova
was Vladimir puttin' it out.

Hello today.
I have paycheck for you.

I need to talk to you.
You fired Paulina, Han?

I am no longer Han Lee.

I have new American name

to go with
changing neighborhood.

To go with
the changing neighborhood.

You need to remember this
for your immigration exam.

Correct. To go with
the changing neighborhood.

Bryce?
Your name is Bryce Lee?

Wait, wait,
um, um, um...

Don't hire a new waitress,
okay?

I've been doing
all the work anyway,

and I really could use
the extra money.

You need help.

- No, I don't.
- Everyone need help sometimes.

I don't. I've been waiting
my whole life, okay?

I've waited on tables,
I've waited in bars,

I've waited on
home pregnancy tests.

I already hire new waitress.

She work in all top restaurants
in Manhattan.

I gave her
Paulina's uniform.

Hi.

Mr. Lee,
not to complain,

but I think someone
wore this uniform before me,

like right before me.

Is it possible
that I could get another one?

Maybe one that's
a little less moist.

Also this mustard color doesn't
really go with my skin tone,

neither do
the mustard stains...

And these
various other stains,

and smells.
I hope that's clam chowder.

So...

I think it'd be better
for everyone,

including
my immune system,

if I just keep on wearing
what I'm wearing,

and not the apron,
'cause this is Chanel.

So thank you,

and let's waitress.

Whatever that is,

it does not belong
in this diner.

It belongs
in a show on Bravo.

But she blonde,
hair so shiny,

good for business.

Where do you even
find these people?

The Russian hooker, the one
before that was a meth addict.

You train her,
I am boss.

- Da boss.
- Oh.

Fine, but make her
wear the uniform.

Are you sure we can't get
the meth addict back?

She was really good
at cleaning.

But her teeth
fall out.

You are really judgmental,
you know that?

I'm only gonna say this once,
so pay attention.

I'm Caroline, by the way.
And you're Max?

Don't get attached.

This is the Williamsburg diner,
owned by Han Lee,

who just changed his name
to Bryce Lee,

because I guess he wants people
to take him even less seriously.

Eight months ago he bought it
from the Russian mob.

Clientele used to be
all eastern bloc criminals

and crack whores, but then
he took it over and ruined it.

Hey, sexy woman.

You look so pretty today.

You look so beautiful, I forgot
how bad your personality is.

Thanks, Oleg.

Hey, Barbie.

He will hit on you
aggressively and relentlessly.

He doesn't realize
he looks like that,

and I don't have the heart
to tell him.

Could we have some menus?

Oh, sure.

Don't smile.

'Cause it raises the bar,
and then I have to smile,

and I can't be doing that.

It's exhausting
and I have a bad back.

That's Earl,
we're in love.

Do not talk to him,

unless you want to feel whiter
than you already are.

Oh, and that stain?

Not clam chowder.

Go marry the ketchups.

Marry the ketchups.
I'm on it.

Okay.
Now divorce the ketchups.

Stop.
Just stop.

There's no such thing
as divorcing the ketchups.

You've never waitressed
a day in your life.

Yes, I have.

You expect me
to believe you

after watching that whole
Temple Grandin routine?

- I'm telling Lee.
- Okay, okay,

I may have enhanced
my resume.

Enhanced?
What, are we in Paris?

Please,
I really need this job, okay?

We lost all of our money.

My trust fund was taken
for legal fees.

My dad is in jail.

What? What are you,
Martin Channing's daughter?

Where's the paper?

Martin Channing?

The guy who ripped off
the entire city is your father.

He told us we were
having a good year.

You're
Caroline Channing.

You're like
a billionaire.

Was.
Was a billionaire.

They froze all our assets,
everything's gone.

I only have
what I could grab,

and I grabbed
all the wrong things.

- So do you know the president?
- I've met him.

- He's hot.
- He's the president.

- Have you been to Switzerland?
- Yes.

- Do you have a horse?
- Yes.

- Do you know Paris Hilton?
- No, she's a hundred.

Excuse me, uh,
two hot chocolate, please.

- Comin' up.
- It...

let me do that, please.

I'm a really
fast learner.

I went to
Wharton business school.

I got 2,300 on my SAT's

Can you make a hot chocolate,
or not?

Nailed it.

We split the tips.
Give me yours.

You did better
than I thought you would.

Listen, tonight
I thought of a way

we could make
some extra money.

They've totally
underestimated

the price point
on those red velvet cupcakes.

In Manhattan the asking price
is at least seven,

so we could sell them for seven,
and then pocket the difference.

Nothing about that
sounds wrong to you?

It's not our fault that
the idiot who makes the cupcakes

doesn't know their worth.

I'm the idiot
who makes the cupcakes.

New information.

That's stupid.

No one would pay $7
for one of my cupcakes.

Really?
'Cause...

Well, at least we know
you're not adopted.

So how'd you even
end up in Brooklyn?

Oh,
I went on monster.com.

Typed in
"place where nobody

from the Upper East Side
would ever go, ever,"

and this diner came up.

You can't wear
a fancy leather jacket

outside in this neighborhood.

You have to turn it
inside out.

Oh.

Fur. Cool.
Turn it back.

So where do you live?

Our townhouse was taken
and bolted up by the bank, so...

Is this where I'm supposed to
feel sorry for you?

I mean,
I don't want you to,

but just so you know,
a well-adjusted person would.

I'm dead inside.

You make that
pretty obvious.

Anyway, I'm just gonna stay
in the city with a friend.

I live a couple of blocks
that way.

I'd walk you to the subway,
it's just that I don't want to.

- Okay.
- Okay.

♪ ♪

Why is the music so loud?

Whoa!

It's 3:00
in the morning.

I'm sorry.

It's cool.
So what are you doin'?

The band's practicing.

But you're not
playing any instruments.

Yeah,
that's how we practice.

We, like,
listen to other good music

and play it in our head.

It's like The Secret.

Well, I have a secret
for you guys.

- Get out!
- Whoa!

- Uh, you guys better go.
- We should go.

Sorry, guys, I still
have to make the cupcakes.

Cupcakes? For why? You can
just buy 'em at the store.

You can do that in
the morning, babe, come to bed.

No, I can't. I have to
be in the city by 10:00.

Fine.
You can have three minutes.

Fine, you can have eight,
one for each ab.

Boom!

Stand clear
of the closing doors.

Well, I can cross that
off my bucket list.

Hey.

I have a taser!

Oh!

Oh, my God.

I am so sorry.

I didn't think it would hurt
so much. It's pink.

It didn't feel pink.

I didn't know it was you.
I thought I was being raped.

That's not
what rape feels like.

Did you...

did you
sleep on the subway?

I had nowhere else to go,

and I'm too afraid
to sleep outside on the street.

God, you're spoiled.

Next stop, greenpoint.

Ugh! Get your stuff. Come on,
I'll take you to my place,

but hurry.

'Cause I have to be
in the city in 30 minutes.

Call me.

Oh, my God,
you've been robbed!

This is
how it always looks.

Oh, my God,
totally cute!

All right,
I'll be back at 4:00,

and we can go to work together.
Bathroom, bedroom,

boyfriend sleeps till 4:00,
yard.

Oh, you have a yard.

Looks like a really nice place
to relax and do crack.

It is.

I gotta go, I'm gonna be late
for my other job in the city.

You have two jobs?

Yes, I babysit
for a Manhattan socialite diva.

Now I have a set.

Sorry I'm late.

Oh, thank God
you're here,

there is
a bridge and tunnel smell

over by the babies
that's stressing me out.

Their diapers
probably need to be changed.

Again? I swear,
the morning nanny just did that.

Motherhood is for reals.

Max, remind me,
what's my Twitter password?

Twitter password.

Yes!

Hi, Brad.
Hi, Angelina.

Max, I need to tell you
something because we're family.

Now get me room temperature
water and come over here.

We are victims
of the Channing Ponzi scheme.

Me, David,
and Brangelina.

How much money
did you lose?

Hold my hands.

Nothing.

But it really scared me.

Open that?

So do you know
Caroline Channing?

No,
but she lost everything.

She has no money.

Can you imagine
having no money?

I mean, you wouldn't even
have any money.

You should twit that.

And no one
will even talk to her.

I heard she went
to six different friends' houses

for a place to stay,

and they all had to pretend
they weren't home.

- That's not cool.
- Yeah.

- That's really sad.
- So sad.

Breaks my heart.

I guess motherhood has really
opened me up emotionally.

Max, I need to hold
one of the babies,

bring me one.

No, the other one.
That's not the good one.

Hello.

Oh, hi. Oh, I'm so sorry
if I woke you up.

Who are you?

I'm Max's friend.
Uh, don't tell her I said that.

I have a feeling if she heard me
call her my friend,

she'd stab me.

What are you doin'
over there?

Just washing my uniform,

trying to make it
a little more cute

and a little less crusty.

Oh, watch out!

Oh!
Sorry, oh, my...

- Do you have a towel or a rag?
- No, I... I got it.

Oh, okay.

I'm Robbie.

I'm uncomfortable.

You're getting me wet.

That's the point.

You're Max's boyfriend.

It's cool.

No, it's not.
Back up, Jersey shore.

You're pathetic,

and that's coming from someone
who's homeless

and wearing white
after labor day.

And I've seen better.

No, you haven't.

Hey.
Why didn't you wait for me?

I thought we were
coming over together.

Oh. Um, I wanted to get here
early to marry the ketchups.

Listen,
I heard something

really upsetting
about you today.

What did he say,
that I came on to him?

Him who?

Nothing.

Him, Robbie?

It's none of my business,

but you deserve better
than that guy.

Yeah,
it is none of your business.

Ooh, I was just starting
to feel sorry for you.

I'm just saying,
you're worth more than that.

What, I'm supposed to
believe you about this?

The person who lied
on their resume,

and lied about the cupcakes...
you're a liar.

- I'm just trying to help.
- You know what?

Since you seem to know
so much about everything,

why don't you
take your Wharton degree,

and your ridiculous coat, and
figure this all out yourself.

Max.

- Max, wait.
- Oh, look,

the arcade fire concert
just let out across the street,

good luck with that.

She's coming back,
right?

She's not gonna
leave me here alone

with a restaurant
full of people?

Let me put it to you
this way.

You might as well be

a night maid
at the Schwarzenegger house.

You got screwed.

- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

That feels so good.

Now put your tambourine
around it.

Hi, honey, I'm home.

I want you gone
by the time I get back.

Babe!
Babe, I can explain.

You weren't
supposed to be home.

People say
I deserve better than you.

Who?

That blonde girl? She doesn't
know what she's talkin' about.

She went to Wharton

and Switzerland.

Yo, yo.
Look at that.

That girl is
workin' harder

than Stephen Hawking tryin'
to put in a pair of cufflinks.

Here, let me help you
with that.

I don't need any help.

Everyone needs help
sometimes.

This isn't
what I ordered.

This is Caroline.

She may have gotten
your order wrong,

but she does
get some things right.

Thank you.

No, thank you.

What'd you see in that guy,
anyway?

He had these
muscle thingies.

- Oh, those things?
- Yeah.

I don't know
what those are called,

but they make smart girls
stupid.

Max!

I thought your tight ass
wasn't coming in tonight,

and my heart
broke in half.

You know what, Oleg?

I needed that.

So, um...

I need a roommate,
if you want to crash.

Hmm.

Not gonna lie, the subway's
cleaner than your couch.

Wow.

I just felt myself
starting to like you.

Really? Because I really feel
like we could...

I knew that wouldn't last.

Come on.

Tomorrow we can
go into the city

and get
the rest of your stuff.

Everything's locked up.

What, you have nothing that
you care about that we can get?

Well,
there is one thing.

The weirdest thing
is that nobody stopped us.

I'm gonna save
a fortune,

keeping him here
instead of in the stables.

When did you put this whole
horse-in-my-yard thing together?

I can't help it.

I see an opportunity,
and I make it happen,

like with your cupcakes.

Like what
with my cupcakes?

Ready?
To open a bake shop,

all we need is
250 grand start-up money,

for the real estate,
and the basic equipment...

Yeah. Oh.

- 250 grand, that's all?
- Yeah.

Did freakin' Chestnut here
kick you in the head

while I was in Starbucks?

Hear me out.

If we both worked two jobs
and made $2,000 a week,

we could open a cupcake business
in a little over a year.

In the past two days,
we've made $387,

and that's a good start.

We can make extra money
at other jobs,

like publicists,
advertising executives...

Janitors, drug mules.

We really need to
work on your self-esteem.

So...

You, cupcakes,
me, business background,

us, success.
What do you think?

I think
you have a horse.

I think we have a horse.

Don't get attached.

(upbeat rock music)

What the hell are we doing
here on a Tuesday afternoon?

The only customer
we've had was Earl

when he forgot he works here
and ordered lunch.

First of all, you're forgetting
the pack of dogs

that wandered in,
had an orgy, and left.

Probably easy for me
to forget 'cause

I wasn't the one
they tried to have sex with.

And we still have to work here
because our dessert bar's

only been open a week;
we need income.

(sighs) I don't like
working in the daytime.

You can see freaky things
in this light.

Look, there's an ant
carrying a stool.

Look, there's
a waitress carrying nothing.

Wow, Han,
you have new-stool money?

Are you in Forbes'
"40 Under 4 Feet?"

I didn't buy this.
Lady Luck threw me a bone.

I'm sure she hated herself
in the morning.

A beloved old man in
my building passed away,

and after the neighbors
paid our solemn respects,

we cleaned the dump out.

Han, that is so disrespectful.

We didn't get a text?

Ooh, I forgot my sweet
hemorrhoid doughnut I scored.

You don't need hemorrhoids
to enjoy it.

Hemorrhoid doughnut.

All of the comfort
and none of the calories.

Ooh!
A new stool.

2005 is shaping up
to be a great year.

That's Han's stool.

Well, Han's stool just bought
a one-way ticket

to Earl's butt.

This the saddest episode of
 Game of Thrones

I've ever seen.

Still, I'm rooting
for the dwarf.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Tonight, we are hitting the
chic-est spot in Williamsburg

to poach their chic-est patrons.

If we start out
with a cool clientele,

models, gays,

rich guys that want to have sex
with models and gays,

we'll be an in-spot
for at least five years.

Were you talking to me
that whole time?

Who else would
I be talking to?

You're the only one here.

-(giggles)
-Oh.

That was a Randy giggle.

And that's Randy's penis.

Not all of it.
It's a pretty small screen.

Yeah, we decided to continue
our nonexclusive,

long-distance,
sexting thing.

Is that the Oxford English
 Dictionary definition?

If Oxford likes to get naked
and squat over a phone.

But your girl's running out
of sexting ideas.

There's only four emojis
that look like penises.

Five if you count
the corn on the cob.

Don't ruin the corn
on the cob for me.

I use that for barbecues
and farmers markets.

That's what you were
talking about?

I've just been adding
"in my pants" to everything.

Example:

"What do you think about
climate change

in my pants?"

Come on, I need you
focused tonight.

No more sexting.

Just put it away and
tell him to do the same.

All right, let me just find
the eggplant emoji

and, of course, the pants.

(knocking)

Hey, girls.

(cheers and applause)

Oh, do you need
a hand there, Soph--

I can do it!

Sophie, why the enormous
old-timey stroller?

There better be
a cartoon baby

dressed like Al Capone
in that thing.

Hey, girls,

can Barbara and me
stay down here tonight?

Oleg and I can't have sex
for two more weeks

and it's just getting
too steamy up there.

So, that explains
the heavy panting

we're hearing through
our ceiling, our walls, and

most disturbing of all,
our drain.

I gotta pee.

I gotta go all the time now.

You know, that's
something that you girls

need to know about me.

Any time that we talk,

I'm peeing a little bit.

Uh--yeah.

Oh.

There's daddy's
little jock block.

(sighs) I tried to release my
sexual frustration creatively,

but my erotic poetry

was rejected by
 National Pornographic

for being, quote,
"just disgusting."

My sexts are so lame.

Why can't I be disgusting?

There's a burrito stuck
to the side of your dresser.

You're there.

"Can't wait for you
to put your butt

"on top of...my butt

in my pants"?

Jeez, thanks for the nice break
from being horny.

I am not proud of
how not slutty it is.

Now, give me back my phone.
It hasn't had its shots.

-Sent.
-What?

"Your testicles are
two glistening Cadbury Eggs,

and Mama's got a sweet tooth."

This mama's got puke
in her mouth.

I cannot believe you'd send
something so disgusting.

You are dead to m--
(text swoosh)

(gasps)
He likes it!

You want to turn a man on?

Heh, you call Oleg.

(strained moans)

I hope it doesn't
make you too jealous, but

I was just
sexting with Randy.

Yeah?

-Yeah?
-Oh...

(strained moans)

Caroline, get the hose.

* *

Okay, now remember,
we're targeting models, gays,

and upwardly mobile millennials
with discretionary income.

Basically anyone
better than us.

Were you talking to me
that whole time?

And yes, I was talking
to you that whole time.

IDs, please?

You know they don't
force you to use

the first picture they take.

I'm eating a pickle in mine.

I think you look great.

Hi, I'm Jake.

Hi, Jake.

ID, Jake?

He's about 27,

lots of discresh income?

27 exactly.

Guess my weight
and I'll buy you a drink.

So, um, how do you maintain
such a dork-less clientele?

I need to know 'cause I have
a roommate situation.

Watch and learn, pickles.

Oh, sweet,

I found Carmen Sandiego.

I don't know where in the world
you're going, buddy,

but it ain't in here.

(both laugh)

Oh, you got this.

But do not let the guy
in the overalls

get out of here without me
calling him "Farmer Yawn."

Max, I am killing it.

Jake, you've met.

Nahani and Ariel are models.
They can eat whatever they want.

* Hate them

And then, this is Tad

and Jameson, they're gay.

I perform reenactments

of the life and tragic death
of Amy Winehouse with Barbies.

I work at Staples.

Oh, power couple.

None of New York's elite
are here, besides me.

I guess I'm not going backstage
at Barbie Winehouse.

You tried to make them
come to this bar

and they said, "No, no, no."

(gasps)
My gay guys at 12:00.

I spoke too soon.

And you spat a little.

Tad!
Jameson!

Welcome to the
M and C Dessert Bar.

No, you're not dreaming!

If they were,
we'd be shirtless dudes.

This place is fabulous.

Can I have one of these
cookie dough-tinis?

It's my cheat night,

that's why I'm with him.

(jovial commotion)

Hmm, not sure
who these gals are.

Max, did you talk about
this place at Pep Boys?

I told Manny and Moe,
but I didn't say a word to Jack.

Oh, Tad.
Let me get you another one.

It's fine, it's fine.

-It is?
-No.

That's gay for "we're leaving."

They chased off
my hot gay guys.

I don't want to be rude here,

but who invited
these horrible women?

Charlene's in the house!

(cheering)

And there it is.
Damn it, Max.

Why did you invite
your bouncer buddy

when you know I'm trying
to cultivate a vibe?

I didn't invite her.

And I did not think
she'd be wearing gym shorts

and a SUNY Albany sweatshirt.

Hey, I know you guys
were trying

to get the cool crowd in here,

so, you know,

boom!

And where are they?
The cool people?

All right.
Take it easy.

Maybe they are cool.

Is that one eating a PB and J?

All right!

Who wants to take on
Big Reba?

Take on how?

Max, you speak Goon.

How?
How--how?

Not fluently.

I only lived in Goon
for a semester.

You're on.

On how?

How--how?

CAROLINE:
Oh good, they brought rope.

I hope they brought
some for me too.

And they did not
bring deodorant.

Ladies, what is this

and how can we
make it stop?

You got a front row seat
to New York City's elite

underground ladies'
arm wrestling.

One, two, three,

wrestle!

(all shouting)

Oh, my God.

I own an arm wrestling bar.

No, you don't.

We own an arm wrestling bar!

(screaming)

* *

I hope you're texting Charlene
and the rest of

her WWE Raw crowd
to never come back to our bar.

Uh, you were sobbing
and begging them to stop.

I think she got the message.

I don't know
if she was listening.

She was carrying Big Reba
around on her shoulders.

This is pitiful.

I just sexted Randy
a picture of a penguin.

I don't even think
penguins are that sexy!

Oh, my God.
Everything is turning me on.

I just walked in on
an elderly lady in the bathroom

and almost lost my mind.

What were you doing
in the ladies' room?

All right, fine,
it was a man.

Yeah, we all have problems.

I have sexter's block.

Want me to take a stab at it?

See, that's already better
than anything I have.

Just write it down.
I don't want

your fingerprints
on my phone.

You think I still
have fingerprints?

Oh, my God.

Are you really gonna
have sext with Oleg?

I don't know why
you think I'm above this.

Out of the way.
Earl's looking for me.

And as soon as he realizes
he's outside,

I'm in big trouble.

Can you unfollow a person
in real life?

Where would he least
expect me to hide this?

Up high?

"Shorty wouldn't go high,"
Earl would say.

Oh, won't I, Earl?

Han, you're talking
to yourself.

And why don't you just
buy another stool?

Earl wants this one.

And for once in his life, he's
not gonna get what he wants!

I'll just keep it under here
till he forgets about it.

Which should be
in about an hour.

Yesterday I caught him
putting pennies on his sandwich.

Hide and seek, old timer.

I don't know
how it's possible,

but he's getting weirder.

Those wrestlers won't be back
tonight, right, Max?

Right, God?
Are you there, God?

It's me, Caroline,
the one you forgot about?

Where'd that turd
hide my stool?

Thanks, y'all.

I knew Shorty wouldn't go high.

Oleg, how you
doing over there?

You're gonna need
a bigger data plan.

* *

(commotion)

Max, it's been
two nights in a row.

If we don't
nip this in the bud,

we're both gonna be lady
arm wrestlers' girlfriends.

You're not exactly thriving

not being a lady
arm wrestler's girlfriend.

And I don't see
what the problem is.

They're paying customers.

They're drinking beer.

From a helmet
they brought with them.

Oh, no, no, no, no.

Don't go, don't go.
Please, please, sir.

Well, the last of our vibe
is leaving.

Pretty sure all these
ladies have vibes.

Guessing vintage plug-ins.

That's it.
Everybody!

Everybody!

You cannot have your arm
wrestling meetings here anymore.

Find a dock or a junkyard

or a Buffalo Wild Wings.

Who wants to drink
where they work?

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

This is discrimination.

-Yeah!
-Yeah.

Look, miss,
I am extremely pro-lesbian.

(audience groans)

Please be lesbians.

We're not lesbians.

Ooh, swing and a miss.

Actually, I am.

That's the first time I've said
that out loud, isn't it?

Wow, that's freeing.

I am just anti-arm wrestling
in my dessert bar.

Well, tough ta-tas.

Which happens to be
my other nickname.

Go ahead, take a shot.

I'll pass.

MAX: Hold on, um,

is that an open offer
on the, uh, ta-ta punch?

Will you at least
order some drinks?

Okay, we'll order

12 waters.

Tap.

(laughter)

You guys, please,
this is my dream.

And my dream doesn't have
soda-stained sweatpants in it.

It's jelly, but whatever.

I'm a reasonable woman.

Yes, that is true.

She's more reasonable than the
Big Reba at the train station.

Fine, we'll leave.

If one of you can
beat me arm wrestling.

But if neither of you can,

my squad and I stay.

(squad grumbles affirmatively)

Getting real '80s movie
up in here.

Huh?
Who's it gonna be?

It has to be you, Max.
I'm weak,

fragile, beautiful,
but approachable.

Ready to get taught
a lesson there, Jugsy?

(scoffs)
School's in session, Reebs.

But call me Max.

Jugsy is my mother's name.

Do it, Max.

She is gonna take you down

to downtown...

Mmm.

In a car,

made of...

pain.

Maybe just watch.

On my count.
One, two, three, wrestle!

(screaming)

(whimpering)

(roars)

(yelling)
Oh--oh!

Wrist can't hold!
Nothing in the tank!

All the sexting!

Fight, Max!
Put your back into it!

My back's shot too.

Haven't you seen my front?

(screams)

(cheering)

We're staying, girls!

Max, what are we gonna do?

I think it's pretty clear.

You're gonna have to
arm wrestle Big Reba.

Can't I just marry her?

Come on now, Caroline,
you got this.

You've been wrestling
with disappointment for years.

And I'm losing.

On my count.

One, two, three,

wrestle!

(screaming)

Ya'll seen the stool?

Han hid it again.

What in the sweet name of Jesus
is going on in here?

Earl, I'm trying
to motivate Caroline.

Do you remember any
of the lines from Rocky?

I'm gonna tell you what
I tell three tourists a day.

I am not Carl Weathers.

Max, I'm losing it!

-Help that poor girl.
-Uh, Caroline,

look at all these
arm wrestling ladies

in your dream dessert bar!

You were aiming
for five years of class,

you didn't even get
an hour!

(grunting)

Hey, I can't get the carriage
in the dessert bar!

The only place it would fit
was the car wash.

Hey, what is all this?

Caroline is trying win
our bar back,

and I'm trying to inspire her

by pointing out
how bad her life is.

And I didn't get a text?

Max, help!

Uh...you haven't had sex
in a year!

And I think you know
I'm being quite generous there.

(screams)

It's working.
She's lonely.

You chased a dollar onto
the third rail of the subway,

and you didn't get it!

(screams)

You work as a waitress
in a diner!

(roars)

Did you mention
the waitress thing?

Yes, I just did, Earl.

Sorry, things are getting
to me a little late.

Wait, did--did you tell her
that baby Barbara

is gonna get married
before she is?

(screams)

Caroline,

six years ago,

you had a billion dollars,

and now--
I'm gonna say it...

Say it!

Old Navy is out
of your price range!

(wails)

(cheers and applause)

* *

I haven't heard from Randy.

Oleg's graphic sexts
must've freaked him out.

Even Siri covered her eyes
after that last one I sent.

You ask Michelangelo
to paint,

and then you criticize
the painting.

Why are you bringing
the Ninja Turtles into this?

I just want to know
what to do now.

I completely understand
if you don't

want to take love advice
from an arm wrestling champion,

but why don't you just say
"hi" or "I miss you"?

"Hi, I miss you"?

No "in my pants"?

Okay, fine.
I'll give it a shot.

Hey everyb--

(cheers and applause)

Damn it.

Do you need
a hand there, Sophie?

No, I got it!

You really don't.

Earl, you can have the stool.

I've had a really hard year,

and I allowed myself
this one indulgence.

But, if it's important--

Sweet, I'll take it.

Oof!
Cold as ice.

I didn't come here
to make friends.

No stool for you.

Hey--hey,
why don't we settle this

the 80s movie way
and arm muscle for it?

At my age, only thing
I can beat is a little girl.

So, yeah.

Bring it on.

This little girl's
tougher than she looks.

EARL: You won't be able

to sit on that damn thing
after the ass whooping

I'm about to lay on you,
Shorty.

Shorty's ass can take
a lot, old man!

We don't want to hear about
your personal life, Han.

One, two, three, wrestle!

Have they started yet?

When this is over,

I'm gonna be wiped out.

You gonna help me carry
my stool back up there?

Here's an idea.

Yeah, you say it, Han!

Burn in hell!

(both straining)

(strained moans)

Remember when I used to
make you moan like that?

(moaning)

You really turn me on.

(various strained moans)

Barbara, you stay
with your daddy.

He's a very sexy man.

Randy texted me back
"I miss you."

Aw, that's so sweet.

Oh!
In his pants!

(grunts)
Damn, Han,

I didn't realize bad breath
was your secret weapon.

(cheers and applause)

Stool me, Shorty.

Who am I wrestling for
the hemorrhoid doughnut?

(cash register bell dings)

(upbeat rock music)

*

It's payday!

And I'm not talking
about the delicious

little treat with nuts.

Han, not cool to brag
about yourself.

Here, Max, maybe you can use
the money to buy a new attitude.

"New attitude"?

Isn't that the name
of the boy band you're in?

And Oleg, you'll notice
I docked your pay

'cause you didn't even come
in yesterday.

I told you,
I was working from home.

There you go, Earl.
don't spend it all in one place.

You think you pay me enough
to spend it in two places?

Oh, my god, this is less than
it cost me to get here today.

And I walked.

I know.

That's all I made?

What is this,
"12 years a waitress"?

With you it's more like
"12 beers a shift."

So many words,
so little everything else.

[thud]
Man: Whoa!

[Caroline gasps]
Not the face!

Not my beautiful face!

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

I warn you,
I was in the nutcracker suite.

What's that mean?
- This!

[Groans]

don't worry Max,
I handled it.

Yeah, I just handled it too.
That's my Booty call.

Are you telling me
you know him?

No, I don't know him.

He just comes over for sex
on Tuesday nights.

Do you need help up?

Not yet, I'm still crying
a little.

Okay, up you go.

Walk it off.

[Groans]

Yeah, I bet that hurts.

Nice going Caroline.
You ruined the best part.

Hi, I'm Caroline, the roommate
and prima ballerina.

Sorry about your sugar plums.

Sebastian.

Ba-ba-ba!
No names! No names!

Uh, Caroline,
you want a soda?

We have soda?

No, we don't have soda!

Why are you asking him
his name?

He doesn't wanna know my name
and I don't wanna know his.

Hey, mind if I use
your bathroom?

I need to check on the boys.

See if they're girls.

How do you not know the name
of the guy you're intimate with?

"Intimate"?

Max, there are certain things
you have to know

about the guy you're engaging
in sexual congress with.

Only you can make sex boring.

Well, not too bad.

One's okay and the other one
left on crutches.

Later.

Sebastian, wait.

This is Max black.

Max, this is Sebastian.

Nice to meet you, Max.

Yeah, nice to meet you too.

And you can just call me
what you usually do.

"Oh, god."

Hey is that a new shirt,
Earl?

Why, yes it is, Max.
I just got it in 1987.

[Text message ding]

Oh, great!
Look at this text.

It's from the guy
whose sperm count you lowered.

His name is Sebastian.

Oh, he's inviting you
to come see him dj.

Oh, damn it! I told you
I didn't wanna know anything

about him,
and now I know he's a dj.

Which means he unemployed,
so points for that.

So what are you gonna text
him back?

Nothing!

The only back-and-forth
I want from this guy

is on his back
and for the fourth time.

The best sex is secret sex.

Then maybe don't talk
about it while I'm eating.

Well, I have a sexy secret.

A crush on a girl.

Oleg,
we all know it's me.

That sweat-pant salute
never lies.

Not you.
don't kid yourself.

You couldn't handle
this beast in the sheets.

I could totally handle you
in the sheets, Oleg.

What are you fighting for,
Caroline?

Hey, everybody!

All right, weather report:

I just came back from a date and
it's raining losers out there.

There's my sexy, sexy,
secret crush.

Who, Sophie?
Not so secret.

You two have already done it in
every public space in Brooklyn.

Yeah, and your apartment,
twice.

What?
We didn't even wake you!

Sophie, baby,

I've been looking
for the perfect woman

and it turns out, what I want
is in my own back door.

Backyard.

I think you're both right.

I hear your truck pull up.

But I'm not sure I wanna sign
for your package anymore.

I knew you were going
to say that.

So as a reminder,
I've created a sizzle reel

of our best sex.

So it's an stdvd?

It's the extended version.

Uncut, as you know.

That's it,
cancel my brownie!

Sizzle reel?

I'll watch it tonight
while I eat my fajitas.

[Text message dings]

Max, you just got another text
from Sebastian.

Who?

Please, can we go to the club
to see him dj, Max?

I wanna dance.

The last time
I shook my Booty

was when we ran out
of toilet paper.

Max, thank you so much
for taking me dancing.

Well, you signed that paper
that said if I did,

you'd do the side work
for the next six months.

Are you sure
this is the address

of the club Sebastian
gave you?

Who?

Sebastian!

This can't be the address.
It's a whole foods.

I know what it is.

I can smell the cage-free
body odor.

Let's just go in, ask someone
if they know where the club is,

and maybe rip a grape off
a stem--I'm starving.

Whole foods, wow.

Reminds me of when
I was a whole person.

Max, we can start looking
for the club.

All right, all right.

I'm gonna lay down some beats
while you check out our beets.

Organic!

See?

This is why I didn't want
to know anything!

You ask a guy his name
and you find out

he's dj'ing next
to radishes.

And what kind of loser
comes here to dance?

¶ ¶

woot! Woot!

Holla!

And I don't mean
the kosher bread!

Oh, no.
How did you find me here?

Whole foods is my sexy secret.

You know
what's not a secret?

The organic preparation h
in that basket.

Whole foods is where I come
to get my groove on.

Why?
Is Chuck E. Cheese closed?

As much as I'd love to see
what else you're gonna buy

to rub on your butt,
we're leaving

before that dj sees me.

You mean
dj fresh-and-local?

The music be bumpin'
and we buyin' pumpkins!

Let's go. I can't believe
I wore these for this.

Wake up.

It's Tuesday, and the dj
didn't come.

Maybe he just drank
too much.

No! He didn't show at all.

There's no dj fresh-and-local
in my ones and twos.

Well, what did you expect?

You ran out of there without
even saying "hi."

We should've stayed
at the club.

Stop calling it a club!

He DJs at a supermarket,

which is the lamest thing
I've ever seen,

not counting the time

you tried to bring back
the phrase

"oh, no, you didn't."

I'm surprised at you.

What if I judged you
for some of your jobs?

Uh, bar-back slash captain
of a shrimp boat

in the Gulf of Mexico
isn't the bomb?

What about when you worked
at the gap?

Who told you about the gap?

You, that time you were drunk,
folding a sweater,

and you tried to help me
"spring into Summer"

with cargo shorts.

Fine! I fell into the gap.
I needed the money.

Maybe Sebastian needs
the money, too.

Who?

[Knock at door]

And if you ever tell anyone
about the gap,

you will have a gap
between your neck

and where your head
used to be.

"Oh, no you didn't."

Hey, I wasn't sure
if it was too late to come by

but the ouija board said,
"go ahead, the girls are up!"

You use that?

The only spirit I listen
to is 2-buck-Chuck,

and he mostly tells me
to take my top off.

Yeah, ouija helps me make
all my big decisions.

Like coming to America,
adopting a Chinese orphan,

and leaving a Chinese orphan
at the fire station.

Those boards are creepy.

You never know what you're
inviting in.

I mean, what if we open
a hellmouth?

Aw, come on, girls,
look around.

I mean, you already have.

Okay, now shh.
Okay...

Ouija,

should I take Oleg back?

Yes?

Oh, now, see,
that is creepy

because I was shoving
it to "no".

Do you want to get back
with him?

Well, I'm torn.

And also,
I don't know what to do.

[Dance music plays]

Throw your hands in the air
like you just don't Kale.

¶ ¶

Max, I'm proud of you
for overlooking his job

and giving this guy
a chance.

He's making a dj face.
I'm out.

Oh, my god, Dylan.

No, we can't leave now.

I just saw this girl,
and she is the last person

I want to see.

What is the problem?

It's hilary waldare.

We went to wharton together.

So competitive with me.

Loved it when I lost
all my money.

She even threw a party
to celebrate

and then had the nerve
to invite me.

Worst party ever,
by the way.

Uh, worse than being
at a dance club

that has a price club?

Max black in the house of grain.

And now he saw me.

Well, I'm gonna go hide
before she sees me.

I'll be in tom's shoes.
Nobody's ever over there.

I'm bustin' out some free range
electronic dance music.

That's right!

I'm bringing it
in my own bag.

¶ ¶

uh, okay, we good?

See you next Tuesday.

Come on, stay.
What's your hurry?

I can't watch any more people
dance-shop.

Max, come on.
Get in front of me.

See what you can do.

Oh, you're behind me
this time--that's new.

All right,
everybody,

frisee, 'cause we got
a special guest dj

in the hizzay

who's so hot
it's radicchio.

Go on.

Bob, I'd like to bid $1.00.

$1.00, Bob, $1.00.

Have your pets
spayed or neutered.

Speaking of neutered pets,
here comes han.

Still counts
as a dj shout-out.

Hey,
why wait till Tuesday?

Why don't I take a break
and we can go in the back.

I just need to find someone
to cover me.

Someone bogarted
all the nut butter.

How about half of someone?

Can I help you, miss?

Max?

What are you doing?

I'm thirsty, broke, and they
cut me off at the free lemonade.

What are you doing?

Well, two dudes
were getting it on

in the family restroom, so...

Where's Sebastian?

Who?

Oh, milk.
Bottom shelf.

What's up?

You're not doing it
in the dairy case!

Uh, no I'm not,
'cause you won't go away.

Do you have to ruin sex
everywhere?

Well, Max,
if I wasn't lactose intolerant

before, I am now.

Oh, my god,
Caroline Channing!

Hi!
It's hilary waldare.

Oh, my god! Hi!
- Hi!

I haven't seen you
since your party.

Someone said you left crying.
How are you?

I'm great! I mean,
I'm shopping at whole foods,

buying some organic fuel
that I'll probably take

a couple sips of in spin class
and then throw away, so...

Oh, good, 'cause I heard
you were still poor

and that you were working
as a waitress.

A waitress?

That is insane.

That is so insane it should be
in an ice tub in an asylum.

I'm so glad you're great,
because when I saw you

in those three-year-old
Louboutins, I got worried.

Also, you have
an orange juice mustache.

Oh. Where's Max?

Milk.

Max, listen--
- busy!

Hilary's still here.

And she called me a waitress.
How dare her.

She humiliated me,
and I didn't even get

a party this time.
I'm going home.

(Store manager)
Hilary waldare, report
to register three.

Oh, my god!
Did he just say--

(store manager)
Hilary waldare.
Register three.

He did!
Oh, my god! Max!

Busy!

What?
Do you wanna just join us?

Hilary waldare works here,
as a cashier!

So I win!

Everyone knows on the job
humiliation chain,

it goes:
Prostitute, hostess, waitress,

cashier, Princess Jasmine in the
Disney electric light parade.

What happened
to not looking down

on other people
with crappy jobs?

Oh please, this is real.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I have got $14

burning a second hole
in my pocket,

and I'm gonna spend it here
at register three.

[Sebastian moans]

Whoo!

What, you couldn't wait for me?

This goes out to Kelly
in prepared foods.

The Kelly with the cystic acne,

not the Kelly
with the bald spot.

Now, where my Adele-heads at?

I'm glad you have no line,
'cause I have an exclusive

private yoga class to get to--

oh, hilary!

Yes, Caroline.

I am a cashier.

I'm sorry, a what?

I'm a cashier.

Yeah, turns out things
aren't great.

My husband left me
for my dad.

And they didn't even cut me
in on the lifetime movie rights.

It's on in January--
father is the bride.

Let me just weigh your salad.

Well, I'm sure you'll pull
yourself together like I did.

'Cause I'm kind of killing it,
life-wise.

That'll be $28.

There's only $14 here.

$28 for a salad?

Well, that's dinosaur Kale.

Oh! Mistake.

Didn't want the dinosaur Kale.

Never liked dinosaurs
and really don't like them

in my Kale.

Dinosaur Kale gone.

You're just putting it
on the counter?

Oh, I don't usually shop
for myself.

Is that not how it's done?

Caroline, do you not have
enough money?

No, hilary,
I have enough money.

I just don't know why
I have so many eggs.

Here. You're holding up
the line.

You obviously don't have
enough money

to pay for your salad.

Sad.

I don't know what
you're implying.

Oh! Here is my very successful
business partner.

Sorry it took so long.
I couldn't find my pants.

I don't know how they made it
all the way to the loading dock.

Face it Caroline,
you came here to humiliate me

and you can't even afford
that egg.

On your face.

Miss, did you drop
this $20 bill?

Yes! Yes I did!

I dropped some money,
too.

don't push it.

Thank you, sir.
This is very kind of you

and I really appreciate it.

Anything for my favorite
waitress.

[Gasps]

Oh, I knew you were
a waitress.

Your store
sucks!

I just had sex
in your dairy department.

Keep the change.

And buy your dad-husband
a wedding gift.

Okay, one more time.

Ouija,
should I be with Oleg?

15 out of 15 yeses.

That's still unclear.

Sophie, this is silly.

You know you two wanna
get back together.

Caroline, we already have
the ouija board.

We don't need another thing
around here that's flat

and wrong all the time.

Fine. Sophie, if it's not me,
after all I've offered you, go.

Ask the spirits who the man
you are supposed to be with is.

Ouija, please spell out
the name of the man

that I'm supposed to be with.

Oh, look, it's moving.

"V," "a," "n,"--

this is what the world
was like before the Internet.

"K," "o."

"Vanko."

Vanko?
Yeah, that sounds cute.

Yeah, I like it--
I'm sorry, Oleg.

The spirits have spoken.

I'm supposed to be with someone
named vanko.

And they know the best.

So you're supposed to be with
someone named vanko?

Mm-hmm.

"Vanko Oleg golishevsky"?

I go by my middle name
'cause there were seven other

vankos in my family.

But I didn't even know that.

Yeah, that means the ouija is--

oh, uh...

Ohh...Yeah...

Oh, no, no, vanko.
No!

I--
no, I--

we can--you and I can get back
together, okay?

But I just can't be here
right now.

No, I mean,
this is just too damn spooky!

[Shrieks]

I can't wait
to tell my brothers,

vanko and vanko,
about this.

Ah, ah, ah...

Word on the street is
you've been talking some smack

about cashiers.

Okay, Rock Paper Scissors.

Loser has to ask the guy
in gym shorts at table 12

to stop Sharon Stoneing us his balls.

By virtue of having this conversation,

aren't we both losers?

Look who's back from Hollywood.

If it isn't ScarJo and J-Lo.

Said the guy from down low.

Can I get an autograph?

Oops, my bad... still just waitresses.

Han, don't be upset just because
I'm about to make $250,000

and have a movie made about me.

Han already had a
movie made about him...

"Paul Blart: Small Cop."

What's your movie called?
"Straight Outta A Job"?


Yeah, about that? You can't fire us now.

The money hasn't come in just yet.

After that, by all means, please fire us

and fire us hard.

Yeah, how does firing us
on the 27th work for you?

Don't think I won't do it.

I've been wanting another
Asian in the mix for some time.

Oh, and, Han, we're gonna
need the day off tomorrow.

You just took ten days off!

No more vacation days.

Freddie Prinze Jr.
Works more than you two.

Max and I are going to
prison to visit my dad.

As part of his therapy,
he's written a musical,

and he's performing it
with the other inmates.

A musical in prison?

I'd be shaking my damn head right now

if my neck still worked.

And, again, you can fire us on the 27th.

We're in flux now.

And as always, I'm the
one who gets fluxed.

Aw, I missed Han.

I've never heard you say that
without a crossbow in your hand.

I can't wait till we get that money.

Think of all the stuff we could buy.

American toothpaste.

Some toilet paper so we
can stop using our bath mat.

And since we're
unfreezing our credit card,

maybe I'll get a new dress too.

The invite to this musical
said "cocktail attire."

A prison musical with cocktail attire?

Ah, screw it.

I'm gonna feel this
tomorrow, but mm, mm!

Mm!

Hey, everybody!

Today's the day Oleg and me find out

what kind of sex our baby's gonna have.

I beg you to rephrase that.

Baby, I don't want to know

if it's gonna be a boy or a girl.

I'd rather be surprised.

You know, like when you
get a hooker in Tijuana.

Boy, do I.

Or girl, do I.

Oh! We don't know, and that's the fun.

We're gonna have a baker

do one of those gender
reveal cakes for us.

Can you guys recommend a baker?

Uh, excuse me?

Yeah, excuse me?

What the hell is a gender reveal cake?

Like, you bake it and then
you pull its pants down?

Jeez, would it kill you

to pick up a "Rachael Ray
Every Day" once in a while?

We give the bakers a sealed
envelope with the sex.

Yeah, and then the bakers...

you know, if we can find good ones...

will make the icing on the inside pink

if it's a Svetlana...

And blue if it's a Svetlenny.

Well, it beats the way they did it

in my town in Poland.

You were either a boy

or you had to know how to
climb back up out of a well.

Yeah.

Um, you know we're bakers, right?

Hell, yeah.

I'm baked right now.

Well, I'm dressed for my
father's prison musical.

Say that three times without crying.

You look good.

If those inmates weren't
hardened criminals before,

they will be once they see you in that.

What's with all the
miniature liquor bottles

you stole from the plane?

Do I have to host a tiny intervention?

I did not steal these from the plane.

I stole them from our hotel room,

the maid cart, and a few
other people's hotel rooms

when I posed as a maid.

This is part of my presentation

for my idea on how
to spend the $250,000.

Five years ago, we
were sitting on Chestnut

with our iced coffees.

I remember it like
it was five years ago.

And we said that $250,000

the exact amount of money we're getting,

was what we needed to get
our cupcake business going.

Chestnut was so excited,
he made a little poo.

Not so little.

I remember it knocking
that cat unconscious.

Five years later,

cupcakes alone aren't cutting it.

Ouch. But true.

Sure, they're sweet,
delicious, and chic,

but what if we add... alcohol?

Which is sweet,
delicious, and expensive?

We keep the cupcake window,

but we make it into a bar too.

It's two great things put together!

Like you and me?

I was gonna say fat people and tripping,

but yes!

We keep the cupcake dream;

we just add overpriced alcohol to it.

I love it!

We can call it Cupcakes & Cocktails.

Or, if we want to be less douchey,

we call it Dessert Bar.

That is a genius idea.

Usually when you're
drunk, your best idea is,

"Let's call Home Depot and
ask if they have caulk."

So we're doing it?

We're opening up a dessert bar?

Oh, we're opening up a dessert bar.

Celebratory dance?

Am I here yet?

I know I'm either at Max and Caroline's

or a petting zoo.

To be clear, that horse
smell is the couch.

Oh, I just came back from the doctor,

and I have the sex of the baby,
but I don't want to see it.

So please take it from me
quick so I don't sneak a peek.

Caroline,

you hold on to this

until it's time to bake the cake.

Why are you giving it to her?

I mean, you really think
she can keep a secret

with that big Jim Carrey
mouth flapping all the time?

Well, you don't want me to have it.

If I know, I'll spoil it.

I have no poker face.

Neither did my mom,
which is how I became

the legal property
of the Borgata Casino.

Caroline, I'm warning you.

Don't let it slip.

Even if I beg you, don't tell me.

Okay.

Even if I come downstairs
in the middle of the night

and put a gun to your head,

don't tell me.

Okay, well, if there's a gun involved,

I'm gonna tell you.

See, Max?

That's why I didn't
want to give it to her.

Your dad wrote and
directed this thing too?

Dang, he's like the Ben Affleck of jail.

Yikes, it says here

that the guy who was
playing "sadistic guard"

is out for tonight's performance

because someone took his
eye out with a plastic spork.

Oh, my God. That's terrible.

We're seeing an understudy?

Oh, look! My dad's opening the show.

So we're just gonna take
a brief intermission,

and we'll be back with the second half.

Second half? That was three hours!

That was incredible, Dad!

Especially the escape attempt scene.

Some of that violence
looked incredibly realistic.

That was because it was
real, not part of the show.

They beat that guy severely.

Martin, I'm gonna add two more crimes

to your prison sentence:

stealing my heart and stealing the show.

Can you sign my playbill?

Caroline, get my playbill.

Oh, here. Hold Sophie's
gender reveal envelope.

Oh, and this envelope I use as a wallet.

And this other envelope
I use as a makeup bag.

Oh, here it is.

Great. I'm gonna use my crayon.

We can't have pens.

Oh, here. Sign mine too.

I'll put it next to that
framed picture I have

of you and Donald Trump
when he was a liberal.

Well, enough about me.

Who's playing me in your movie, hon?

Not Brad Pitt. It's too on the nose.

Well, they haven't cast it yet,

but they are giving me
$250,000 for my story.

Honey, this is your ticket.

Now you can start your own business.

I have my own business with Max.

The cupcakes?

I'll admit business has been slow.

But we're gonna use the money

to take our business to the next level.

Max had the genius idea
of making it a dessert bar.

We still sell our cupcakes,

but we also serve high-end cocktails.

You can just say the word "muddle"

and charge $20.

That is a fantastic idea, ladies.

Wow, it's so great.

Honey, do me a favor.

Could you get me some water?

I want to stay hydrated
for tomorrow's matinee.

There's talk of Robert Durst
transferring in just to see it,

and I don't want to jinx it, you know.

Oh.

Wanted to ditch the square, huh?

I get it.

Is this finally happening?

Celebration make-out sesh?

Uh, yeah, we got to keep
our hands in plain view.

This whole cupcake business
is not for Caroline.

Well, she's not the baker; I am.

She's the idea person.

Yeah, but you had the
dessert bar idea, right?

And you just said it
was a terrific idea.

Well, as you saw...

I'm a really good actor.

Can I itch my nose?

Look, my baby was brought
up around Wall Street.

She's Wharton bred.

She could never be happy doing
this whole baking business,

and this is her big chance to get out.

But wouldn't she have told me?

She tells me every single
feeling she's having.

And some of it, I even listen to.

What if I just ask her?

She'll only deny it.

She doesn't want to hurt your feelings.

That's why I'm doing it.

But she said she was happy
about the dessert bar.

We danced about it.

Max, listen to me.

I'm her father, and I know her.

And this is her big chance.

You just got to let her go.

I do?

Yeah, and you got to be firm about it,

or she's not going to get the message.

Like in "Poltergeist,"

where they have to be
really stern with Carol Anne

or else she'll stay with the ghosts?

And I'm the ghosts?

Ooch!

Max, what is going on with you?

Are you all right?

I'm fine.

I'm just making Sophie's gender cake.

If you don't want to be
here, go back to Wall Street.

What?

What is going on with you?

You've been pouty ever
since we left the prison.

I'm not gonna take you there anymore

if you're sad to leave.

You know what?

While I'm doing all the work,

why don't you go get
me the gender envelope?

Okay, Moody Giuliani.

Do not tell me you lost the envelope

with the gender of
Sophie's baby in there.

I didn't lose it.

I just don't have it,

and I don't know where it is.

Oh, we probably left it at the prison

when you made me get out the playbill.

Oh, so this is my fault.

The one thing you had
to do, you didn't do.

Like a waitress at a vegan restaurant,

you're bringing almost
nothing to the table.

The $250,000 I'm bringing to the table,

that's nothing?

Oh, so that's your money.

There it is.

So why don't you take your money

and go back to Wall Street?

I'll be fine.

Who came up with combining
desserts and alcohol?

I mean, obviously, you've
been holding me back.

I've been holding you back?

You forgot to wear pants
to a business meeting.

How dare you?

I did wear pants.

I just left them in the bathroom.

Okay, well...

Well, this is a historic event.

We've sold cupcakes for five years,

and this is the first
time you've touched batter.

It's a historic event

because you finally had a business idea

that didn't have the word "fart" in it.

If my hair gets involved, we are done.

Good.

Girls, I'm going to...

What have you done?

I have an egg allergy!

♪ 25 to Li... ♪

Hey, what a nice surprise.

You know what else is a surprise?

That the makeup lights in
a prison are so flattering.

I don't remember him being in the show.

Yeah, he's not.

He's just a felon who
likes false eyelashes.

So what are you doing here?

I think I left an
important envelope here.

I tried calling, but they said

your phone privileges were taken away.

Yeah, well, I had a fight

with the prison theater critic.

That's the headline you go with, Eddie?

"Shanks for Nothing"?

He sure is a big man on his blog,

but he can't look me in the eye.

Well, I would have gone
with "It's A Prison Riot."

I think I left an envelope here,

and I think it ruined
me and Max's friendship

and our partnership.

All right, well, here you go.

Here's your envelope,

and here's your makeup bag.

Hey, um...

I'm real sorry to
hear about you and Max.

Yeah.

Unless maybe it's a good thing

and it's happening for the best

and you get to go back to Wall Street

and reclaim your life.

Wall Street?

Why does every single
person keep telling me

to go back to Wall Street?

Max, you...

all right, it's just Max and you.

Here. Let me do that.

Okay.

Listen, honey.

You only have to work
on Wall Street, okay?

You can live on the Upper East Side

and eventually move to Westchester

if you want a tennis court.

Daddy, did you and Max talk about this?

Kitten, I know you better than anybody,

and I know that you do not belong

in a cupcake shop in Brooklyn.

You could still be friends with Max.

She like tennis?

How do you know where I belong?

Go like this.

I'm not the same spoiled
little rich girl that I was.

Well, now you can be.

These last five years

have made me a different person.

For example, when I walk

into a combination Taco
Bell-Dunkin' Donuts,

you know what they say?

"Hi, Caroline."

Son of a bitch.

See, Daddy, I'm Taco Bell,

and Max is Dunkin' Donuts.

On the surface, it seems
like we shouldn't be together,

but we make an amazing team.

And we have a dream together.

It's not just hers; it's mine too.

Well, that's the hardest thing
I've had to take in all day.

And for lunch, they served
us something called "brown."

See, Daddy, this is where I belong.

Well, not here, even though
I will miss the lighting,

but with Max.

Well...

I guess I can support that.

Look, I'm sorry. Sorry.

You know, I worry, okay?

That's what parents do,

and there's lots of time to worry

when you're in prison,

which is why I focused all my energies

on creating groundbreaking
musical theater.

Are you sure you didn't tell your dad

that I told you that he
told me to tell you that?

'Cause snitches get stitches.

My dad wouldn't hurt a fly.

He'd just steal $1 billion from it.

Not bad for my first cake, right?

Well, if you don't count all the ones

I threw in the garbage.

I did count them. There were seven.

Two of them were fizzing.

But thanks for trying.

Max, Caroline, come on!

How long is this gonna take?

I didn't wait this long
for the polio vaccine.

There's a polio vaccine?

Well, you might have
to wait a little longer

to find out the sex of the baby,

because Max and I have a new
business announcement too.

Is it about me firing you?

Because I already
reserved a karaoke machine

for your Good Riddance party.

I'm not saying cancel
it, but you can't fire us

till we have our new
business idea up and running.

And I'm talking dibs
on the "Thong Song."

All right, so here's our big news.

We should have gone to Rosebud's Bakery

for the cake.

You know, 'cause when
you order one there,

they don't say, "Hey,
guess what happened to me!"

Pretty tacky, Caroline.

Says the guy in a tank top

from the Steven Seagal
for Target collection.

Now the wind's out of my sails.

No, it's not! We're
opening a dessert bar!

All right, give me the knife.

To cut the cake?

No.

Well, then I'm not gonna give it to you.

Like I said at this
diner a million times,

give it to me, Caroline.

Okay, baby, you do the honors.

Why do we need to
know the gender anyway?

They all switch 'em now.

All right, one, two, three.

Boy or girl?

It's white. What does that mean?

Well, it means it has a chance

of getting nominated for Academy Awards.

Oh, no!

I was so busy putting
out that oven mitt fire,

I forgot to put the color in it.

But I could just tell everybody.

No, 'cause if I hear it from you,

I'll already be mad at the baby.

You know what, Sophie?

Maybe it's a sign

that we shouldn't know
what the baby's gonna be.

You're right.

Keep the cake, girls.

We're not gonna pay.

Well, do you guys want to try it?

No, thanks.

I've got a lady coming over.

We're gonna try to figure
out how Netflix works

and chill.

I also have a lady coming over.

Yes, it's a lesbian
masseuse for my ferret,

but it counts.

I guess you're the only one

who's gonna taste my first cake.

I also have a lady coming
over, question mark.

Come on. One bite.

Wow.

Could you dial 911, please?


How could ketchup get this hard?

You just hold it in your hand like this, and say

You are the biggest ketchup I've ever had.

Hey, everybody. I got it, I got it.

Don't panic. At least you caught it in the early stage.

No, I got the papers so we can see if our ticket win the lottery.

120 million dollars.

Fun! If we win, I'll get an eighth of my trust fund back.

Come on. Now, who's got our ticket?

I've got the ticket. I put it in here.

I figured it's where everybody else gets lucky.

By the way, if we win,

I'm gonna buy a condo right next to Great Adventure and go there everyday drunk.

Also put a soda fridge in my garage fo sho (for sure).

Earl, what are you gonna do with your share if we win?

Well, I'll get out of this club chop as fast as I can,

and set me up with some kind of a Hugh Hefner  situation.

Here we go, for the big money.

Woo. If I win, hello Netflix subscription.

We need a six, a ten, a five, a 12 and a nine.

And the first number is��6!

And the second number is 47.

Good thing I didn't pay my share of the tickets yet, suckers!

Before I forget, I printed up more of our cupcake business cards

So we can hand them out at the Williamsburg crafts fair.

Oh, can't wait

Me and you handing out free cupcakes

stuck between hipsters selling crochet

iPad sleeves and Salt-n-Pepa Salt and Pepper Shakers.

We are not just giving them away for free. It's marketing.

One person eats it and spreads it around their friends.

So we are herpes.

Hello, Sophie.

If you looked any sweeter, you would fire up my diabetes.

Oh, Earl. You wouldn't be the first man to lose a limb over me.

Sophie, I'm surprised to see you in here.

Stutter buzz says you and Oleg are no longer together.

Wow, this little girl likes to gossip. Yes?

Won't you scutter your little butt over there

Come see me in my booth.

Are we over here so Oleg can't see you through the kitchen window?

What is this? Diner or back issue of Cosmopolitan magazines?

I grew up reading Cosmo.

I mean, what a six-year-old doesn't need to know? The hidden male erogenous zones.

It's the nipples, the end.

I came to give you girls a cleaning job tomorrow.

We can't tomorrow. We are doing the crafts fair.

We are turning down a real paying job to go to the crap fair?

Yes, it's important that we focus on the cupcake business.

And you can't spell "focus" without "us".

Or FU.

Hello, Sophie.

Hello, Oleg.

So, do you miss the sex?

Oh, you know what? We should go.

No. We are having a conversation here.

And besides, the sex was not that good.

Oh, it was that good.

It wasn't that good.

Please, I beg you. Let us go.

You can go. I'm kind of into it.

Like, it's like a dirty Downton Abbey.

So why are you still standing there

giving me those sad, cow eyes

in that brown velure.

Because it's a good look on me.

And because I'm waiting for you to admit that you came here

because you miss the sex.

I miss summers in Minsk.

I miss smoking in hospitals.

But I don't miss the sex.

Fine, then. What would you like to eat?

I'll have my usual sausage.

Ok, ding. It's ready.

Max's homemade cupcakes.

Max's delicious homemade cupcakes

- Let's move this along. Max's homemade cupcakes.

Max, come on. Could you at least try and have a better attitude at the crafts fair?

I was doing fine until my hair got gang feather by that girl from that church of good vibes.

Hi!

I'm from the Funnel Cake booth back there

and your little table is sadder than watching the notebook at a funeral.

Hey Dutch girl,

why don't you go stick your finger in a dyke.

I'm sure you can find one over near the plus sized denim.

Max, please. We are all business woman here.

Yeah. Some of us wearing table cloth on their heads.

Just so you know they make shift tables cause we are just starting out.

We've only been in business eight months.

Heidi, how long have we been funneling?

Everyday 24-7 for the past three months.

And we already have a booth.

Yeah we do.

I have to say you girls really take the fun out of funnel.

Actually we put the fun in the funnel.

See? You can't start "funnel" without "fun".

Or FU.

Three months and they've already had a booth. We're behind.

Max's homemade cupcakes.

Take this!

See? Success!

Scaring people into participating isn't success.

It's Scientology.

Calling Sophie we're taking that job.

You'd better have a good reason you're late,

because I managed to get here on time despite removing the disease pigeon feathers from my hair.

I do.

So today when we were cleaning up that apartment and I had my hands in a total stranger's toilet,

I realized if we're really gonna be successful, we've got to think outside the bull.

So after I thoroughly washed my hands,

I know they never really come off though, right?

Off your soul, I mean.

I made a call to a connection I know and got us a real cupcake job.

And it's in Manhattan. It's the first birthday party for the son of a socialite.

60 cupcakes with buttercream frosting. Up top.

Buttercream?

This is not the response I was expecting from my business partner.

I was expecting wooo! Awesome job! Thumbs up, buddy.

Why? Is your business partner on a show on Nicklodeon?

Look I don't do buttercream.

Buttercream is a bitch.

If it doesn't stay refrigerated, it falls apart as fast as a two-celebrity marriage.

Max we have to take this job, it's the next step for us,

cause all we're doing these days is cleaning apartment and working at the diner.

That's not all I'm doing. I also babysit for Peach.

Oh, Peach is fine with it.

Why would Peach be fine with it?

Look I was gonna tell you this after the Nickelodeon high five

but that didn't happen and I got thrown.

Peach is the connection I used to get us the party.

You called Peach without asking me and begged her for a job?

I didn't beg. I ask her if she knew anybody who could use us

and she was more than happy to recommend us for her friend Constance.

No way I'm not comfortable with this.

Sometimes you have to do things that make you uncomfortable.

It's the way you grow.

No it's the way you get a ride home from a keger in the woods.

Max.

Max I'm sorry but we can't turn into those people who work and work

just to pay their bill don't have any time to pursue their dreams.

You mean Americans?

I'm telling Peach tomorrow we're not doing it. Now go get some milk.

No problem cause that's what waitresses do and

apparently that's all we'll ever be.

What?

I have to prove the sex was not that good.

Oleg on the food?

Don't say it like that,

That ham was already glaced before we go there.

So I am guessing you are back together?

Oh no no, the sex was not that good.

Oh, it was that good.

I went to get Mayo,

and it all happened so fast.

Ok babies, give me fashion, give me a face, yea.

Peach, I don't know what's going on in your apartment,

but I would like it on the record:

I'm not a willing accomplice.

So what is going on here?

Well, Brad is giving us seduction like his name sake

and Angelina is giving us nothing like her name sake.

This is pretty fancy set up, were the kids nominated for an Oscar?

Best performance by twins in a ridiculous situation?

It's a photo spread for my new mummy blog,

I'm calling it Mummy and Me. Isn't that clever?

And original.

I had a blog since my friend Constance started her blog,

we both have blogs and we both have babies.

Only her babies are adopted from Africa.

She will be winning if I didn't have two from a poor white hell billy thuggery.

About your friend Constance, I think I was supposed to do a party for her.

Max, please don't screw this up because I hate her and I need her to love me.

Yea, here is the thing. Thank you,

but Caroline should never have called you and asked you for a favor.

I'm not comfortable asking to do that.

But I did it for you.

And now you will do that for me.

And Max this has to go swimmingly

which is a new word I just learned.

So you are saying I can't get out of it?

I'm saying: Max, you can't get out of it.

Max, still not talking to me because of the Peach thing?

Fine.

Those are some pretty bad ass buttercream cupcakes,

ain't no drama going on in that box!

Ok, I just went gangster, and not even a smile?

What? Are you planning to never talk to me again?

You nodded, if you were deaf that would be talking.

That's true, my brother is deaf,

not from birth, from firecrackers.

Relax, we still have time.

Ten more minutes on the train and a 15-minute walk.

The buttercreams are not gonna melt.

- Some people just like to create non-verbal drama. - En huh.

Attention passengers.

- There is an obstruction up on the track ahead. - No.

I bet someone jumped in front of the train.

Oh my God, what a tragedy,

the buttercream!

Attention passengers.

We apologize for this delay.

There is still an obstruction on the tracks ahead.

It's totally like a body.

They can't get it off and what not.

We should be moving shortly.

What is with this guy? He said that 20 minutes ago.

How are your cupcakes? Mine are getting a little loose.

Still? Still not talking?

Fine, Max. Now I'm not talking neither.

What is with her? She said that 20 minutes ago, too.

And she just keeps talking.

I know, right?

We probably hit the body.

So it is all up in the wheeling and what not.

Well, if there is what not under our wheels, and I don't get these cupcakes there,

I'm going to lose my babysitting job.

- Are we babysitters or bakers? - I was talking to him.

Stay out of this.

Nina,

if you two are bakers, maybe you should break up some of those cupcakes,

so we all don't starve.

No one is touching these cupcakes.

Our entire future is riding on these mothers.

I think I'm smelling like a, like a dead body smell.

Miss, you are making things so much worse in here.

Are you telling me you don't smell that?

It's like when my sister burned herself throwing firecrackers at my brother's ear.

This train is out of service.

We are approximately two blocks away from the next station.

We're gonna have to take you on foot.

Please form a single line and we will escort you to safety.

We are gonna walk?

They expect me to walk through a subway tunnel in heels?

Hey everybody I think we know who we are gonna eat first.

My god, it's so hot up in here. It's like 200 degrees.

If I faint and fall down,

the others rats will like eat me and what not.

Rats? Max, are there rats?

It's a subway. The floor is made of rats,

but you really have to worry about, the ninja turtles.

Thank you for responding.

Hold up.

I'm telling you right now. If I lose my babysitting job over this,

the rats would be the better option for you.

We are only two blocks from the station. We can still make it.

How are your cupcakes?

They are still holding together.

Like us. We are still holding together.

Geez, come on, don't bring gal. Less talk more walk.

Folks, It's a bit of gap here.

A gap? There can't be a gap. Why is there a gap?

Because people need reasonably price basics.

I'm gonna hop across and help the rest of you over.

Hey miss, you are next.

I put the line on, just grab it.

You know how many times I heard that from a guy in the tunnel?

Hey, just take these.

Careful, sir, it's buttercream!

I'm throwing you my purse. Here it comes.

Thank you. Right. Thank you.

Ok, miss, you next.

Hand me over the cupcakes and jump.

I can't. I'm terrified.

What if I fall? The rats will eat me.

I can never come back from that.

Bankruptcy? Yes. Rats? No.

"Hey Caroline, where are your toes?"

"Well, it's a long story."

Girl, if you fall that third rail,

it will fry you way before the rats get there.

Listen, Mariah, you are freaking me out.

If we're lucky, the rats will eat your mouth.

Caroline, it's ok. It's just a step. Take the step.

Hold these.

Come on, I'm right here.

I took the step, now you have to take the step.

That's right. You did. I do.

Here we go.

Back up everybody. Yea!

Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

Go Caroline, go Caroline, ahhhhhhh!

I saw a rat. We made eye contact.

You know what? It would probably be easier if took those heels off.

Sir, that is never going to happen.

We are in Manhattan.

I may be under it but I'm still in it.

And when they pull out my half-eaten body,

I will be wearing my heels.

Mariah?

Why? I only have one.

What are you gonna do?

Jump back over and do something and whatnot?

Constance, we're sorry, we are late.

I don't wait. I don't wait for anything.

I already have the iPhone 8.

Sorry, we couldn't help it. We were trapped on the subway.

Well, just put some cupcakes on a plate

cause I got a roomful of women out there who need to cut something in half

and then eat the other half, and they need to do it now!

Welcome back to Manhattan. How do they look?

Like they all had unprotected sex with each other?

Oh, how are you two? I'm looking for the babies, I'm about just ten seconds I'm just giving up.

- Peach, there is a problem with the cupcakes.  - There can't be.

Constance will kill me, literally. Her last two best friends went missing.

That is not attractive at all.

Is... is that what food looks like?

Why are there no cupcakes out? If you two work for me, I deport you.

There is a bit of cupcake situation. The buttercream sort of broke down on the way up.

It's not a problem, we can fix it.

I'll just run to a delly get what we need to touch them up and no one's the wiser.

And I take the full responsibility. My partner warned me that buttercream was a bitch.

I'm not being rude, that's technical baking term.

You expect me to pay 300 dollars for these?

Caroline Channing, I have to say that you're a bigger con artist than your father.

Then I have to say you're a bigger bitch than the buttercream.

I'm not your boss, so I can't hit you.

But I'm sure that Peach won't be your boss much longer either.

Right, Peach?

But I love Max.

She's been with me since I bought the twins.

I can't live without her.

You are never coming to another one of my parties.

Max, you're fired.

It's my fault. You lost your babysitting job, and I feel awful.

Hey, I'm the one who call that bitch a "bitch".

And I'm gonna write those awesome films right up until we got evicted.

Why can't you just admit that the sex was that good?

You know it, I know it, the ham with the bite marks in the freezer knows it.

Ok, fine. The sex was that good,

as was the ham.

It was that good because it was more than just sex.

It was love.

Oh... it is not love.

Oh, it is love.

Oh... it is not love.

It was dirty, disgusting sex.

Yes, it was.

Oleg, do you really love Sophie?

Yes, I do. And one day I will kiss her.

Her lips will be mine.

Wait, you never kissed her?

Not on the lips of her face.

But that day will come.

Man, I can't believe that I'm actually saying this,

but that is pretty freaking romantic.

I'm looking for Max, I think her last name is "Black".

Oh, sorry, maybe it's "African American"?

You think her name is "Max African American"?

Peach, what're you doing here? Who's with the twins?

They're in the car, don't worry,

I rolled up the windows and locked the doors, so they're safe.

Max, I'm sorry for pretending to fire you in front of the Constance.

Pretended? That felt pretty real.

Yeah, I'm good. My fake orgasms are so real even I believe them.

Peach, this is all my fault. Please give Max her job back.

That's why I'm here. Max, come back, I need you to watch them tomorrow,

and then everyday.

Peach, I don't think I can work for you tomorrow,

or any other day.

We have to focus on our business.

Max, are you sure you're comfortable with this?

No, I'm not comfortable, but that's the point, right?

You gotta take a step.

Well, then how about just for another year?

By then the twins will be old enough to take care of themselves.

No, but I promise I'll come by and say "Hi" to the twins whenever I can.

Oh, Max,

I will never find someone as wonderful as you who speaks English.

Bye, Max.

Wow, good for you, good for us.

Hope so. That's the first job I ever quit without a job to take its place.

You have another job. You work for yourself.

You're your own boss.

My own boss? I can't wait to sleep with myself to get a promotion.

(Max)
Ah, it's like I'm back
in my mother's womb.

Only, there's food here.

(Caroline)
Ugh, those e-cigs
are so stupid.

I mean, smoking real cigarettes
kills you,

but smoking fake ones
makes me want to kill you.

They're not smoking.
They're vaping.

(Max)
Uh-oh.
He just passed it to her.

Someone's getting date vaped.

I just figured out
the new phones.

Now I've got to figure out
how to smoke?

If I wanted to learn
everything all over again,

I would have had a stroke.

(Max)
Hey guys, sorry, but you're not
allowed to do that in here.

And I'm not talking about
your outfits.

I'll get to those
when I bring the check.

Relax, it's not a cigarette.

It has a battery.

Yeah, so does my vibrator,
but...

can't use that in here either.

[bell dinging]

I didn't approve that rule.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

Well, I think we ordered
too many of our cupcake tees.

There are more
unworn shirts here

than in Matthew MacConaughey's
closet.

Hey, girls.

Look at me.

I got my Sunday bra on
'cause I just came from church.

Was it my church?

The Church of Latter-Day Sluts?

Oleg and I are looking
for one to get married in.

And it's got to have
a wheelchair ramp

'cause I've got a lot of cousins
who were born without leg bones.

I'm so excited for you, Sophie.

You deserve all the happiness
in the world.

I mean, so do I, but that's
obviously not happening.

Are you done with
your pity-party?

'Cause I got to speak to Max.

Max, do you want to be
my maid of honor?

I would rather be
eaten alive by a rabbit.

Which would take a long time
and be a lot less embarrassing.

And Sophie,
you don't really want me

to be your maid of honor.

That's right.
I don't.

So why are we even
talking about it?

Sophie, as honored as I am
that you asked,

it's just not really my thing,
you know, man?

Is this really not your thing?

It's nobody's thing.

You just do it
'cause you're supposed to,

like bleaching your teeth
or your anus.

Thank God I'm off the list,

'cause that bridesmaid spa day
is gonna be rough.

Look, I'm sorry, it's just,
I was a maid of honor

in fifth grade when my mom
married her cult leader.

And then she was
my maid of honor

when I married him a week later.

So I'm kind of maid-of-honored
out.

Maybe I'll get one of my old
sorority sisters

to be my bridesmaid.

I'm gonna go home and find out

which one is still thin enough
to fly commercial.

All right, where are we gonna
store all these shirts?

It's already too crowded
in here

with all the cupcakes, shame,
and failure.

We'll sell some of these
at the cupcake window,

20 of these
are already going

to that fancy boutique
in Manhattan,

and the rest,
maybe we'll get lucky

and find a gay
little league team.

Oh, I know!

Let's get drunk.

That's your solution
to everything.

Seriously.

We need to just take some
to that new bar

where idiots pay $20
for a drink.

Drunk and stupid,
that's our target audience.

And also, the special skills
I've listed on my resume.

So you're saying we're gonna
stoop so low

as to sell T-shirts
out of a duffle bag in a bar?

Yeah, we're there.

How much do you think
this pays?

'Cause I can do that.

Yes, you can.

All you need is a stepladder
and boobs.

Feel like the Star Trek:
Next Generation bar.

Keep your eyes peeled for
Whoopi Goldberg in a crazy hat.

I can't believe I'm selling
T-shirts out of a duffle bag

in the future, too.

Yeah. I fully support mixing
business and pleasure.

Best sex I ever had was
with my boss at a Panera Bread.

I thought you said
the best sex you ever had

was with a dude
with six fingers.

Same guy.

Man, could he make
a sandwich crazy fast.

Hi. Want to buy a cool tee
for your girlfriend?

Let me see if my girlfriend
wants a tee.

You want a tee, honey?

(Max)
Hey! Hey!

Not so fast.

They say "cream filled"
on the back.

Huh, boys?
Anything?

Wow, gays aren't fun
in the future.

Hey.

Jesus comes back
in the future.

So what's in the bag?

I've never met a girl at a bar
with actual baggage.

That's funny because you mean
like emotional.

You're really beautiful.

Mmm. You weren't nearly
this hot in the book.

So can I get you ladies
a drink?

Sure, you could jut change
this water into wine.

Can you, like, do this for me,
just, like, once?

Drinks on me.

Oh, lucky them.

I haven't heard I'm beautiful
from a non-homeless person

in months.

Well, with that hair,
the jury's still out.

Hey, can I kiss you?

I suppose a peck wouldn't--

Say what?

- I'm James.
- I'm wet.

Because my arm was sitting
in water on the bar.

That was so hot, Max.

I have, like, this animal
attraction to him.

What animal?
The Horny Nerd?

Look, I'll leave.
You stay and do your thing.

- But we came together.
- Yeah, I know you guys did.

It happened, like,
the second he kissed you.

I don't do this.
I just met him.

Look, Caroline.

I haven't read the Bible.

But I know that when Jesus
returns,

you must follow him
back to his apartment.

Let go...

let God...

get to third base.

Max, where's Caroline?

I haven't seen her all day.

But I'm guessing
she's in heaven.

[footsteps approaching]

I'm here, I'm here.

Nope, she's in hell.

Walk of shame,
party of one.

Girl.

Gir-irl!

Tell me everything
that happened.

Leave out no details.

It was insane.
I mean, like, so hot.

Like the Caribbean
or our shower that one time.

[screaming]

What are you two celebrating?

I know it isn't
a job well done.

We are celebrating
the release

of the new Star Wars:
Episode VII trailer online.

Seriously?
[giddy laughter]

Max, we did everything.

We--

Oleg, can you give us
some privacy?

What?

I can't be in the ladies' room.

I can't be in the kitchen.

So did you...

No.

Well, did you...

No!

Well, did you at least...

Oh, God, no!

Well, what did you do?

Water a plant together?

We had sex.

Last night and today.

That's a big thing for me.

And, yes, it was.

Yes. That was obvious
in the bar.

Skinny jeans are just
boner X-rays.

Oh, no.
Oh, no.

What, rat in the slaw again?

My rings.

I left them at his place.

I have to get them back.

They're half my belongings.

So just text him and say,
"Yo, I left my rings,

nice wiener,"
"100" emoji, send.

Max, I can't text a guy first.

It's bad enough I have a Groupon
for intimacy oil.

Look, worst-case scenario,
the McRib is gone for good.

Second worst-case scenario,
we can always implement

the two-week rule.

The two-week rule?

Wait, isn't that how long
you have to eat Pad Thai

before it becomes bad Thai?

No, you really have
to read my book.

It means if he doesn't text
for two weeks,

you can break in
and get your stuff.

All that fancy school
and you didn't learn nothing.

Two weeks and nothing.

I really thought he'd text.

I also thought Grown Ups 2
should have won the Oscar.

Still got it.

Come on.

[grunts]

Wait, before I lose
the rest of my self-esteem...

Tell that to the wall
you're currently straddling.

Let me just check my phone
one more time to see if he--

Nope.

Self-esteem gone.

I'm afraid to jump.

Jump, whore, jump!

I sound like my mom
teaching me how to swim.

[grunting]

I did it.
I did it.

That was, like, two feet.

I've snorted lines longer.

All right.

Just another Tuesday.

Going all Bling Ring
in Jesus' backyard.

There.
That's his bedroom window.

I know 'cause we had to close
it, since I'm kind of loud.

Oh, what are you like
during sex?

What do I do if he's home?

Do you want me
to kill him fast,

or do you want him to suffer?

And by that, I mean,
do you want me to hold him

while you ask him
why he didn't call?

He's not home.

According to this Instagram,
he's at Chipotle

talking to a guy with a parrot
on his shoulder.

He had no time to pop off
a text to me.

Oh, it's stuck and I can't fit
my boobs through there.

I can barely fit them
through the Holland Tunnel.

Fine.
I'm going in.

Finally, having no boobs
pays off.

Lift my legs up.

Okay, but your legs in the air

kind of got you here
to begin with.

- Uh-oh.
- What oh?

I don't remember him
having a floral duvet.

Or a bedside toilet.

[barking]

[growling]

Or a dog.
Pull me out! Pull me out!

You've got to read my book.

I have a whole chapter
on pulling out.

[whimpering]

No, no, no, no, no!
Oh, stop licking me.

(woman)
- Buster? Buster?

Someone's coming.

Someone's coming
or getting licked?

Maybe you are
in the right apartment.

[screaming]

Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

No, no.
This is a big mistake.

Ben, call the cops!

We got another crack addict
here!

We don't have crack here!

We don't have crack here!
And tell your friends!

[police sirens blaring]

If these match the prints found
at an Arby's break-in in '07,

it's purely coincidental.

I can't believe
this is happening to me.

My life is over.

Look at the camera.

I'm so humiliated.

And turn to the side.

Ma'am, this isn't
"Vogue: Behind Bars."

Sorry, Officer,
she's a virgin.

Me, myself, spent some time
in the juvie system

up in Providence.

You know a family court judge
named Shelly?

No.
Go.

Oh! Officer, hold.

Thanks, but stay away during
the full-body cavity search.

Proceed.

You think?

So you girls broke into
an old lady's house,

got halfway through the window,
and stole absolutely nothing.

Glad I am protecting
the city from you.

I mean, ISIS who, right?

All right.
Let's go.

If he had just texted me,
none of this would be happening.

I wouldn't be in prison,
I'd be home.

My other prison.

Uh, wait,
if who had texted you?

Thanks for asking.

This guy I slept with
didn't text me

for two weeks after we had sex,
and I left my rings

at his place, so I--

You did the two-week rule?

Yeah.

But she got the wrong apartment
because, knowing her,

her eyes were closed
the whole time.

Well, why didn't you say so?

We got a two-week rule
over here!

Stay right over here.

We'll get you out soon.

I left my billy club
at the Captain's house.

He's got three more days.

See? See?

It's gonna be fine.

We'll just chill here
for an hour.

It's like an edgier
Lens Crafters.

What am I gonna tell my father?

A prisoned prison call?

I can't be here.

I can't be here!

No! No! Come back!
We were good!

[alarm buzzing loudly]

Dumb move.

Dumber than me and the Captain.

Let me guess, our glasses
won't be ready in an hour.

I can't believe you got us
arrested in jail.

Where are we going?

I mean, besides nowhere in life.

You girls lost your
get-out-of-jail-free card.

You're gonna have to get someone
to bail you out.

You're going
in the holding cell.

Yo! Fresh meat!

Sorry, I have a reputation
to uphold.

[Caroline whimpers]

Max, I'm scared.

I got this.

Yo! She's already my bitch!

So she can't be anyone else's.
Sorry.

Hold my belt.

- What?
- Do it!

(Max)
'Sup, 'sup?

Cool, cool.

50 women, 1 toilet?

It's like backstage at The View.

Max, I can't handle this.

I can't handle this.

I couldn't even watch
The Green Mile.

Relax.
This is play-jail.

It's not like we're doing
real time.

Just put on your game face.

I don't have a game face.

Unless the game is
"I Give Up, My Life Is Over,"

then this will do.

Well, do something, because
that's about to get wiped off

your face by the bruiser
covered in tattoos

making her way to us
right now.

Hey!

You guys signing up
for the talent show?

Excuse me?

Yeah. Some of us have been
in here for days,

due to prison overcrowding.

So the guards let us
put on a show.

As long as nobody dies.

Wow, prison has changed.

Maybe I have a Norman Rockwell
idea of prison,

but, uh, what happened to
shanking a snitch

in the food line?

Oh, a talent show,
that's not scary at all.

You know,
I won my yacht club talent show

three years in a row,
in the 10 to 13 division.

That's crazy!

I'm looking at 10 to 13
for grand theft auto.

Where are my manners?

I'm Tanaya.

I'm Max.
This is Caroline.

But you can call us
by our gang names,

White Lightning and The Blade.

Sophie, I need you to bail
me and Caroline out jail.

We got charged with
breaking and entering,

which is also what Caroline
let a guy do to her,

and that's why we're here.

Oh, jeez, Max.

I mean, that's a tough call.

I mean, I don't know if I can.

Yeah, it's really not my thing.

You know, man?

I get it.
I deserved that.

I said no to you,
so you're saying no to me.

Like the old saying,
"Tit for bigger tat."

Yeah.
Hmm.

All right, let's see.

Uh, I would bail
my maid of honor out of jail.

Fine. Fine.

I'll be your maid of honor.

I'll buy you penis straws,
and those glasses

where the nose is a penis.

Yeah! And the penis-shaped
pasta?

I'll do it all.

I can handle the slammer, but
Caroline doesn't stand a chance.

I saw a woman looking at her

like she was
a cartoon pork chop.

Okay.
Well, I'll see you soon.

And watch your back.

Oh, you know what?

It's a ladies' prison,
so watch your front.

Is this your card?

No.

Yes!

Yes, that's my card.

Amazing.

Okay.
What'd I miss?

The magic show
and the improv troupe.

They asked the audience
for a word.

I said, "Help."

Sophie's coming down
with bail money,

as soon as her turkey is out
of the oven.

So 4, 4 1/2 hours,
depending on the stuffing.

Thank God.

Wait.
Bail for both of us, right?

That wasn't her original offer.

But after some negotiating,
we got there.

What did you have to do to--

Max, you didn't agree to--

Yup.

Picture me in something
low-cut and peach.

A slutty peach.

You'd do that for me?

I'm touched and shocked.

I thought you'd have forgotten
me, had sex with the door guard,

and been halfway across
the parking lot by now.

Yeah, well,
he wasn't into me, so...

Walk of shame,
party of two.

Girls, I heard
you got locked up.

Yup. We have to do 30 hours
of community service.

And Caroline won six minutes
of privacy on the toilet

in the talent show.

Well, not so private.

I had to tinkle while a woman
in work boots

made heavy eye-contact.

I went to prison once
for being at the wrong place

at the wrong time.

Meaning, I was down south.

Look who's back
from the big house.

Every house is a big house
for you, Han.

Watch your step, ex-con,

or I'll get the to haul you back
in for impersonating a waitress.

I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I missed this place.

When I was up in the pen, doing
time with my girl, Tanaya--

Well, orange you the new black?

So did you two have fun
in ladies' prison?

And tell me, is it anything
like the 17 XXX movies

I have with that title?

Okay, so I lost two
of my best rings.

So I'm out $11.

I realized I'm tougher
than I thought.

I sang in prison.
I had a one-night stand.

I'm practically Johnny Cash.

Well, Johnny No Cash.

[cash register bell dings]

Evening, ladies.
Gals' night out?

Chasing guys, eating pie,
having fun.

This table is sticky!
Run a damp rag across it!

Would it kill you
to clean a little?

What kinda place is this?

The kind that serves soup cold.

And what's with
your crazy earrings?

What are you, some kinda gypsy?

Whoa!
Hold up, ladies.

You don't get a bitch pass
just 'cause you're old.

Yes, that's right.
I said it.

You come in here with
your gangster granny attitude,

think you can get away

with dumping all over
the lowly gypsy waitress.

No way. At this diner, we don't
discriminate due to age.

If you're gonna act
like an ass,

I'm gonna treat you
like an ass...

No matter how close that ass
is riding to the floor.

Now, I'll wipe off the table
we'll take it from the top.

Hi, I'm Max.
Who wants tapioca?

That's more like it.

Save the disappointment
for the grandkids.

Earl, I need another book
of checks.

The last one fell between
the refrigerator and the oven.

I'd reach for it,
but that falls between

"I don't do that"
and "Oh, hell no."

Look overthere, Max.
Men and women in suits.

This neighborhood is
definitely on the rise.

I remember a time when a black man

couldn't get a cab around here.

And that time was Wednesday.

Max, I was just talking to
the smart couples in booth two.

I know they're smart because
they're the first people in here

who ever ordered the croque monsieur

as croque monsieur and
not "crock monster."

They wanna meet the woman
who made the cupcakes.

I told them you'd be right over.

- Go! They're so nice.
- No, they're not nice.

They're trendy, blood-sucking locusts

who come into this neighborhood
to pillage and destroy

crashed my 21st birthday.

What?

You made these cupcakes?

Yeah, what's the problem?
Spit it out, I've got a life.

We just wanted to tell you
that your flavor palate is...

amazing.

I don't know who you are
or where you came from--

Neither do I.

But these are fabulous.

Well, welcome to the neighborhood.

I knew I liked you guys.

So what did the trendy locusts want?

You are so judgmental, you know that?

They wanted to tell me the
cupcakes are "fabulous."

Thank you.

Maybe now you'll finally start to get it

if someone besides me
tells you how good they are.

I believe the word was "fabulous."

Pick up, Max.

Oleg, from now on, you
may call me Countess Max

of the Fabulous Cupcakes.

And you may call me Sir Oleg

of the Amazing Party in My Pants.

Caroline, the happy,
shiny people in suits

asked me to give you this note.

Oh, what a great idea!

They suggested we sell Max's cupcakes

at the cool new coffee
place in their building.

But you already sell
cupcakes here in my diner.

Han, we're building a cupcake
business that will one day

get us out of here.

That's what we're trying
to do with our lives.

But I thought we
had something special.

Yes, but we're not exclusive.

The diner's cute, but
I want more than this.

Oof.

First girlfriend all over again.

Hey, Johnny.

Max has the tables against the wall.

Oh, we're good in your section.

Caroline, I want you
to meet my buddy Carlos.

Hi.

Well, I'm working the counter.

What's happenin'? Come on, dude.

You have a literature degree from NYU.

I didn't mean to say
that, but when I get nervous,

my Rico Suave comes out.

It won't happen again.

And here's two menus.

What's happenin'?

Dude, I'm nervous.

Hey, guys, I'm in
that section over there.

Oh, we're good in Caroline's area.

Well, if you like hot
coffee in your pants area,

you're in the right place.

Actually, I like that.

Coming right at you.

Johnny's in your section.

Yeah, why?

He comes in here every night to see you.

He's your friends
or...crush or whatever he is.

Shh! He's not a crush. He's a...

I don't know what he
is, but whatever he is,

he's in your section.

- Max!
- Ooh! What are you doing?

You're not supposed to be in here.

I know, I'm a bad boy.

Look, the reason I'm not
sitting in your section

is because my buddy Carlos is
crushing pretty hard on Caroline

and he asked me to do
what I can to hook them up.

Oh. So now you're a bartender,

a street artist, and a pimp.

Ain't nuttin' wrong with me
pimpin' some boy on the side.

Keeps me in spray paint and whatnot.

So?

From pimp to pimp...

Help me out with your girl.

My girl don't come cheap.

Is it hot in here?

Yes, and we're in a freezer.

Yes. My freezer.

I was, uh, just talking to Max.

Um, I'll see you out there.

So is this what you like in the men?

No. He's just a
customer that went rogue.

He is weak and girlish.

A woman like you needs a real man.

You know what they say.

Once you go Ukraine, you
will scream with sex pain.

That probably lost
some of its sensual appeal

in the translation, but
thanks for the offer, Oleg.

Cute, but I'm not interested.
Besides, he's not my type.

Just say it.

You're not interested in him
because he's Puerto Rican.

Where did you get this idea

that I would only date white guys?

For your information, I've
dated all kinds of men.

I once had a Spaniard in Monte Carlo.

Isn't the title of an Abba song?

Are you sure about this? He's cute.

And trust me, you could use a
little salsa in your white rice.

Max, I just lost every dollar I had.

The last thing on my
mind right now is guys--

any type of guy.

Except this guy.

Hi, Chestnut.

I'm much more concerned
with our business

and getting my head back above water.

Men will come sooner or later.

Well, according to my
research most men come sooner.

Oh, I thought we should stop by

that new coffee place tomorrow
and introduce ourselves

and your cupcakes.

I'm not gonna walk in there.
I feel like I'm selling out.

Okay, let's reframe
the phrase selling out

and make it sold out,

as in "Max, we sold out of the cupcakes"

and are now successful."

What's that you say?

I can now afford to buy
the wax dental floss again?

Fine.

But I'm only doing it so
you'll eventually get your mind

off the business and get laid.

Why do you think I
need to get laid so badly?

If I'd just gone through
all the tension and trauma

that just happened to you,

I'd be climbing telephone
polls to take the edge off.

Trust me, sex is the last
thing on my mind right now.

Oh, and speaking of reframing things,

I have a surprise.

I redecorated my room.

I scoped out some cheap
fabric in bedding places

down on Houston Street.

What do you think?

I think you've made a vagina.

What?

Sister, you may think
that sex is the last thing

on your mind, but you turned
your bed into a vagina.

Do you think my vagina has curtains?

I don't know how long it's been.

I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

Okay, but I still
have to make the cupcakes

to bring by that place tomorrow.

I don't wanna keep you awake

so why don't you sleep in my bed tonight

and I'll pass out on your vagina?

Okay, but you better buy
me breakfast in the morning.

I love this place. Looks
like Paris in the '20s.

More like poseurs in their 20s.

Man, they've really
cleaned this place up.

You've been here before?

Yeah, it used to be a liquor store

owned by this old Irish guy

who had freckles on his penis.

Sometimes he'd corner you and flash it,

but then he'd always comp
you a free lotto ticket.

Okay, well, let's try and keep

that sort of charming nostalgia

out of our sales pitch.

Oh, that's the owner.

I scoped it out before you got here.

And remember, I'll do the talking.

Why don't I get to talk?

Freckled penis.

And besides, I have more experience.

All those who pitched business
models to Warren Buffett

as a member of the Phillips
Exeter Entrepreneurs Club

raise their hands. Holla!

Well, if you care enough
to raise your arms about it,

fine. You talk. I won't say anything.

Hi, what can I get for you?

Hi, I'm Caroline and this
is my business partner Max.

- And you are?
- Semhar.

- Oh, jeez.
- Such a pretty name.

It means "light of
the tiger" in Sanskrit.

Oh, jeez.

It's my yoga name.

Help me, God.

Well, Semhar, we just opened

a local neighborhood cupcake company.

Our card.

We're introducing our exciting product

to local boulangeries.

Please try a sample. Max.

Would you like
coconut-coffee, chocolate-curry,

or blueberry-lemon zest?

My absolute fave is the coconut-coffee.

Let's start with that, shall we?

Thank you, but no thank you.

Well, can I ask you why?

They're not pretty enough.

Excuse me?

They're not pretty enough.

Perhaps if you tried one,

you'd see how amazing
our flavor palate is.

Hold off, Flava Flav.

What do you mean,
they're not pretty enough?

They have a charming homemade look,

but my customer would prefer

a more upscale, prettier product.

Just FYI, some upscale residents

in this very upscale building

where your upscale
store actually is located

recently told us they were fabulous.

I understand.

But they're not pretty enough.

Listen, battlefield earth.

This is Williamsburg, Brooklyn,

and no amount of exposed brick and paint

can change the fact that,
right where you're standing,

I've seen Tommy O'Hanlon's wing-wang

more times than I care to remember.

And I must say, it was way less
offensive than your attitude.

And you can shove that up your upscale.

Let's go.

- Namaste.
- Namaste.

What's with the empty hands, Max?

No cupcakes tonight?

No, they're bugging me. I
decided to take the night off.

Be careful with decisions like that.

In 1987, I took a night off
from earth, wind, and fire

and the next day, they
earth, wind, and fired my ass.

Hi. Sorry I'm late.

Mid-afternoon nap in your vagina?

I wish! No.

I went to a cheap bakery
supply store in Greenpoint

and got us some supplies.

Here.

It's the basic cake decorating kit.

And best of all I found us a fun,

reasonable two-session
cupcake decorating class

at a bakery.

We can learn how to make pretty roses.

No way.

The cupcakes don't need to be pretty.

They compensate by having
a great sense of humor.

Pretty cupcakes is just
another option for our business.

People want pretty, we do pretty.

Or people want
homemade, we do--

- Wait, where is our homemade?
- I didn't make any tonight.

You didn't make any?

What, you get one piece
of constructive criticism

and you stop making them?

Max, it's business.

And maybe Semhar has a point
about making them pretty.

First of all, what does
she know about pretty?

The woman has dreadlocks.

Her head looks like the stuff

you empty out of a vacuum cleaner bag.

Not pretty.

Forget her.

What's happening with you?

What's your problem with pretty?

Don't wave your
divas live hand at me.

I just think society's way too concerned

with other people's
idea of what's pretty.

You don't think you can do it.

That's what this is about.

This isn't about society.

You're afraid you can't do pretty.

Look, I don't do pretty

the way you don't do Puerto Ricans.

What are you talking about?

I'll do Puerto Ricans.

All right.

Then go do one and leave me alone.

Max, it's a skill. That's all.

It's not shameful to not
know how to do something.

Didn't you have piano
lessons growing up?

Seriously?

Ice skating?

Closest I've come to blades on ice

was when a pregnant
girl pulled a knife on me

at a hockey game.

Look, you and I have a business,

and this is a skill we need.

We're going to that class

and we are gonna master
how to make pretty roses.

And I know how much you
hate anything trendy,

so I found us a family-owned
Italian bakery in Brooklyn.

Italian's good.

Maybe they'll know how to dump the body

after I kill you.

First of all, welcome
to Spice and Sugar.

We did a little twist on the
traditional sugar and spice

putting spice first because...

We're Italian.

And we always got the spice up front

and a little in the rear.

Holla!

Now are you embarrassed
you ever said holla?

My name is Stephanie, and
this is my cousin Serena,

and this bakery has been
in our family for years

and then we took it over and made it...

Hot.

All right, let's go around
and introduce ourselves

and tell us why you came tonight.

Let's start with the cute guys.

Always!

I'm Steve, I thought this would be

a fun idea for my bachelor party.

I'm getting married to
Michael...right there.

So cute. God bless!

And I'm Michael.

- I'm Michael as well.
- Michael.

Oh...So many Michaels.

- And you are?
- Michael.

No, I'm Max.

Oh, she's funny. So cute, God bless!

And I'm Caroline. I'm Max's partner.

- Oh, so many gays tonight.
- I know.

No, I'm her business partner.

We actually have our own cupcake
business over in Williamsburg,

and I must say, we're doing very well.

Max is the baker and
I'm the business head

and we're here tonight to
increase our skill level

and take our business
up to a level that's...

Hot as well.

If you're gonna talk that much,

no one will have time to learn anything.

I know, right?

So, uh, where's your shop?

Well, right now, we're just
working out of our apartment.

- So no shop.
- Oh, that's sweet.

- Cute.
- Yeah, good luck, God bless.

Can you say jealous?

All right, let's start simple

with a pretty little icing flower.

Everybody pick up your piping bags,

and with a
straight-edge tip--

But you guys can use your gay-edge tip.

All right, everybody watch Stephanie.

You're gonna take the nail head

and you're gonna make a little "U"

so that you get little petals.

And we'll do this five times.

And then, you have a pretty
little five-petal flower.

- Simple.
- So cute. How fun!

No, no. You gotta
start by making a "U".

I did. That's a "U".

- Serena, is that a "U"?
- Not a "U".

Fine, I'll start over.

That was a "U".

And what, just because I
don't have a quote-unquote shop

I don't know a "U"?

What's with the attitude?

All right, let's leave.

Next time the gays giggle,
we'll just slide out.

No, we're here to learn.

That looks good.

I suck. I'm starting over.

Max, why'd you do that? It was good.

Not good enough.

You two not done yet?

You have to master the little flower,

or when we move on to
roses you'll be screwed.

- Right, cuz?
- Oh, totally screwed.

Screwed and not in the good way.

Do you think we can convince them

that slapping each other's
face is the new high five?

Steve, oh, my God.
That rose is gorgeous.

Good for you.

All right, one more minute
and we'll display our roses.

Psst. Steve. Little help.

I choke at timed tests. I
got like a 40 on my SATs.

Damn it, Steve!

Look at this place.

There's no way these girls

could have this much cupcake
success in this economy.

I mean, the overhead
on this building alone--

What are you saying?

Not saying mob money,

just saying maybe we'd have a shop too

- if we had mob money.
- Shh.

Keep it down.

You wanna wake up tomorrow
with Chestnut's head

in your vagina bed?

Okay, time's up.
Let's see what you got.

What is that? There's
like nothing there.

That's not a rose.

- It's minimalist.
- Whatev.

No, not "whatev". It's brilliant.

And I would know because,
when I was in Tokyo,

I had a private Japanese
flower arranging class

with the head of the Ikebana institute.

And he said I had a gift.

In his words,
"Caroline..."

Whatev. Okay, what
about your friend there?

I kinda ran out of time.

You had 20 minutes.

I thought she said you were the baker.

No, you need to be able to whip
these out in like 20 seconds

if you wanna be successful
in your little bakery.

"Um, I'd like a cupcake."
"That'll be 12 hours."

- Right?
- Right.

And they have to be prettier than that.

Well, maybe you'll
do better tomorrow.

Remember. Your homework assignment

is to bring in a cupcake
with a pretty rose on it.

Right.

Like we're gonna come back here

and spend time with
these Robert de Nir-hos.

Ugh! That one stinks too. Damn it!

Max, forget it.

It's 3:00 A.M.
Go to bed.

Don't. Don't say anything to me.

I am so mad at you right now.

- What did I do?
- Everything.

I used to love making cupcakes.

It was the one thing
I could zone out and do

without thinking.

And now all I'm doing is thinking.

Thinking that I stink
at making cupcakes.

Well, stop it.

Who cares what they think?
They're bitchy baking bullies.

We don't have to go back there.

Oh, and then what?

I'm gonna think my
cupcakes weren't good enough

for the rest of my life?

You said we need the skill,
then we need the skill.

I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a quitter.

I'm gonna make a stupid,
pretty cupcake if it kills me.

Or you.

And you are going back there with me.

And we're gonna shove our pretty cupcake

right up Snooki and her cousin's asses.

Now, shut up, don't talk to me,

and go back in your vagina.

Sorry you had to see that, Chestnut.

Oh, not very pretty.

But at least you tried, Michael.

Just one question.

Are you sure that you're gay?

Oh, okay, Caroline.
Let's see your pretty rose.

I didn't do one.

Society is way too concerned
with other people's idea

of what's pretty.

Whatevs.

Okay, what about your baker there?

She bail too?

No, here it is.

- Mm-hmm.
- Max, that's so pretty.

I'm so proud of you.

Good work, God bless. Good for you.

How long did it take you?

About three hours and 40 minutes.

But I did it!

I just wanted to prove to you and myself

I can make something pretty.

And now
that I have--

Mm!

That cupcake wasn't
me. I don't do pretty.

But I did make each of you
a cupcake that I think says

what I feel about this
whole cupcake class.

This one says "Bite me".

This one says "Screw U".

You see that "U"? That's a "U".

Holla!

Well, good luck with that.

People don't want
cupcakes that insult them.

Oh, my God, Max. That's our thing.

I was wrong. You were right.

We don't need to make pretty cupcakes.

Everybody does pretty.

We have to do what you do best.

Insult people.

Yeah, who's gonna buy that?

We will. For our shower.

And really let us bitches have it!

MAX: Previously on
 2 Broke Girls...

The hurricane is headed
right for Williamsburg.

Fedoras are blowing
down the streets,

craft beers are spilling
everywhere,

and indie bands are
cancelling practice.

(wind whistling)

This explains why Randy
isn't here yet.

He's probably stuck
in the store.

He's not answering and it's
going straight to voicemail.

He probably blocked you.

We're really broken up.

Let's go hug
our dessert bar.

It was probably
so scared.

Oh, my God, Max.

Our dessert bar is destroyed.

I think we have to finally
admit it to ourselves.

Ugh, we're cursed.

(water drips)

Yeah, this is personal.

Come on, when that gypsy
pointed at me in first grade

and said, "Biggus Boobus,"
that was a curse.

I'm sure we weren't
the only business

that was ruined
by the storm.

We're not cursed.

(water drips)

Yeah, now it's starting
to burn.

Well, I am choosing to take
this disaster as a sign.

It's not like we don't
have insurance.

And while they're
rebuilding this place,

I'm gonna go surprise Randy
and try to rebuild us.

You see the parallels?

You get it.
She gets it.

Girls, did you hear?

Turns out only one business
in the entire area

was affected by the storm.

I wonder which one--

Oh.

File this under
"Story For Another Time"?

(rattling)

(screams)

Biggus Boobus!

(rock music)

*

Ugh, I don't believe this!

All the airports
are more shut down

than I am emotionally.

Earl, have you had any luck
with any busses or trains?

I'm on it.

What button do I push
for the Internet?

I just talked
to the insurance company.

They're gonna pay
for all our repairs.

And they gave me
some extra money

'cause I told them
we were pregnant.

Can we please focus on how
I'm gonna get to L.A.?

I have low self-esteem
and a well-viewed sex tape.

I should be there already!

Max, I'm gonna try
to put this delicately.

You're acting like
a cray-cray psycho stalker.

I am not a stalker.

I'm the one that gets stalked.

That reminds me,
I should probably tell Gary

I'm going out of town.

Oh, he knows.

He left a bon voyage dookie
on our welcome mat this morning.

But the card was sweet.

Well, then
as your best friend,

I am going with you
to make sure you're okay.

You know, Randy did give me
an airline voucher

when I ruined our relationship
the first time.

I could probably get
two tickets for that,

so I could put my feet up.

Or I guess you could come.

If I'm the wing-lady
on your stalking mission,

I'm gonna go ahead
and call this a vacation.

Wow, that's sad.

All right,
I'm almost on the Internet.

Does anybody know
my password?

It's "Earl."

Oh, right,
my first dog's name.

Hey, everybody!

I just got in a fight
with one of Barbara's friends

in the IKEA ball pit.

Yeah, if you're gonna
bring meatballs in there,

you gotta bring some
for everybody.

Yeah, there's never enough
meatballs in a ball pit.

Earl, how we doing
on our trip to L.A.?

Well, the rental cars
are rented out,

trains are down,
and no flights till Tuesday.

And I got a message from emoji.
Who's emoji?

Hey, why don't you two
just road trip it?

You know,
throw a cooler of beer

with pulled pork in the trunk
and just go, baby.

I would do the same
if I didn't have

that giant breastfeeding baby.

I'm talking about Oleg.

May I suggest
the Toyota Yaris I sold to Han?

It's efficient on gas,

and the trunk can't
be unlocked from the inside.

Oh, no!
You're not taking my car.

It's my turn to drive
my quilting group

to the farmers' market.

Han, we can do this
the hard way

where you don't give me the keys
and I give you a wedgie,

or the easy way where
you do give me the keys

and I give you a slightly
less intense wedgie.

The keys are in my office,
but you're not--

Oh, dear, I've said too much.

Who do you see
winning this one?

And you should know,
Max keeps a pocket full of sand

for these kinda things.

Jingle-jangle, bitches!

You should be fired for
what happened back there.

Bathing suit areas
are off limits.

Fine, use my car,

but I'm going
to be driving it.

I'm coming with you.

I finally got the gas pedal
extension where I like it.

But who's gonna run the diner?

FYI, I managed a pretty
successful jerk shack for years.

Ew, Oleg.

What? Get your mind
out of the gutter.

We sold Jamaican-style chicken.

As a front for
full-release massages.

Y'all, what was
my first dog's name again?

-Earl.
-What?

I guess my only options here
are Oleg and Earl.

Woof, real Murderers' Row.

Who are you gonna
have waitress?

'Cause you know
they'll have to match

the extremely low bar
set by my associate and myself.

Ohh!

Oh, can I do it?

Oh, who am I kidding?

Or course I can!

I actually used to be
a waitress at Pooters.

You mean Hooters?

No, it was Poland's version.

Yeah, all the waitresses
were bottomless.

I'm hoping there were
a lot of hairnets involved.

Oh, you'd think so.

Han, I'd say you drive
like a little old lady,

but three of them
just passed us.

I had more fun driving
my bitchy friend Neil

to get his blisters drained.

Also, what's the strategy here?

We've been driving for hours.

Well, once we find
an open airport,

we'll fly to L.A.,
where Max will surprise Randy,

and she'll be all, "Ahhh,"

and he'll be all, "Ahhh."

First of all,
great Randy impression.

I almost gave you
a little "Wahhh."

You girls have
less of a game plan

than any season of
 American Horror Story.

Well, who really needs
a game plan anyway?

I'm on vacation, baby.

See?
Didn't even tear up that time.

What's with these snacks?

Vegetables?

Are you on
that bunny diet again?

No, I gained weight
on that somehow.

Han, there's a lot
of Goo Goo Dolls here.

GGD: Live Goo.
 Wow.

I'm taking music criticism

from a proud member
of the Juggalo nation?

Hand me a radish.

I mean, how long are you
supposed to chew a radish?

Forever?

Can I interest anyone
in a side trip

to Pine Creek Gorge?

If you love the Grand Canyon,

you'll think Pine Creek Gorge
is pretty good.

Oh, my seasonal gourd.

Look at Randy's
Snapchat story.

This movie's got
such a large budget,

they even got the lawyer
is own trailer.

Oh!
Scratch that.

I'm sharing it with
a very large scorpion.

(gasps)

You're jealous
of a scorpion now?

That's where we're at?

No!

There's a finger
on Randy's shoulder.

A woman's finger.

Manicured nail,
no wedding ring.

How dare she?

Yea nor nay
on Pine Creek Gorge?

The exit's in three miles,

and I should start
changing lanes.

So that's a maybe?

I gotta finger this out!

Ugh, why can't you zoom in
on a video?

I know we have
the technology.

It was used against me

in the case of Bass Pro Shops
versus Max Black.

Ugh, I think there's
a pit in my fig.

That's a prune,

and I'd pace yourself.

Caroline, could you
call the diner and check in?

I've been getting
the machine all day,

and I gotta make sure Oleg
isn't shooting a porno there.

Oh, he didn't get the funding.

His Kinkstarter campaign
fizzled out.

There, the phone is unplugged.

Good luck calling
the police now, table two.

Wow, you unplugged that phone

faster than we unplugged
my Aunt Esther.

She was a mean lady.

Sophie, ready to re-enter
the workforce?

I'm ready.

The question is,
are you ready?

And the answer is
no, I am not.

Hey, everybody!

Can I take your order?

Miss, sparkling or still?

How's everything tasting?

* Mmmbop, ba duba dop

* Ba du bop, ba duba

* Ba dup bop, ba du, yeah

* Mmmbop, ba

I wish you guys
would win American Idol

so I'd never have
to hear from you ever again.

Oh, come on, Max.
Listen up.

What's a road trip
without a sing-along?

I don't know, tolerable.

Now let's talk about something
everyone's interested in.

I screen-grabbed
Randy's video,

which enabled me to zoom in.

And upon zooming,
I realized that--

You're going crazy?

Max, seriously,
maybe we should go back home.

Randy blocked you.

You have to expect
there might be a new finger

in his life.

I am not going crazy.

I'm merely scouring
the World Wide Web

for female friends of Randy
who are tagged in a photo of him

with their index fingers
cropped out.

That way I can piece
the two photos together

jigsaw style
to get the answers I deserve,

and oh, my God,
I think I'm having a breakdown.

She's not the only one.

(gears grinding)

Please tell me that was
Caroline's prunes kicking in.

I can't believe we're broken
down in the middle of nowhere.

Amanda Knox had
a better vacation than this.

We have to start walking.
Leave that suitcase here.

What did you pack in there,

one of your long-winded
anecdotes?

Funny story actually.

I was going
through my sweaters,

and I realized
that when I was 14--

Hold that thought forever.

Now you wanna find a finger,
you gotta use a finger.

(gasps) Max, no!
We can't hitchhike.

What if some psycho
picks us up?

Really, who wouldn't
want to wear this skin?

I think the problem
is the transmission.

There is none.

I hitchhiked
all the time in school.

Nothing bad ever happened.

I did spend a year locked
in a guy's shed once,

but that was mutual.

I'll tell you
what I told my prom date,

put that finger away.

I thought your prom date
was gay.

He was.
He was doing a lot of this.

Oh, good, tinted windows

for a more private
murdering experience.

Um, this thing is smoking
more than my grandma

at the Bingo finals.

You girls stuck?

I think "stagnant" is
a better word for us.

Name's Becky.
With the good hair.

(laughs)

Y'all need a ride?

Thanks. We're going west,
Fievel style.

If you could take us somewhere
with outgoing flights.

I can drive if you want.

I used to do it for
a Colombian drug lor--

Frito-Lay.

I can get you all the way
to Missouri,

home to street violence
and a large percentage

of America's OxyContin
epidemic.

Great, and, Max,
at least you'll know people.

Oh, good, we got a ride,
'cause that car is deader

than the conversation

at the Jolie-Pitt
Thanksgiving this year.

Oh, sorry,
you girls can come,

but I don't let strange men
into my cab.

Oh, I can vouch for Han.
He's not a man.

It's okay, girls.
Go ahead without me.

I'll just call AAA.

Cool.
Later, hater.

Wait!

You're really leaving?

Who leaves someone
on the side of the road

in the middle of nowhere?
(horn honks)

You're not people!

Excuse me, Miss?

Oh, not you again.

Listen, don't eat this.

I ordered a steak,
and this is a dirty washcloth.

You want me to heat it up?

I mean, why am I
always getting you stuff?

How come you're not
scratching my back?

(laughs)

See how I told him off?

You know, just like
Max does, right girl?

Why are you calling me girl?

I'm calling you a woman.

You like, like the girls
do with Han,

only he takes it.

I mean, I wasn't
expecting all this.

Well, neither was I.

This is supposed to be
my nap time.

This is my vacation.

That's how bad
my real life is.

And I'm trying to get back
with my ex.

He blocked me on his phone,
and I am one diaper away

from being that
crazy lady astronaut.

I never had the courage
of putting myself out there.

I mean, romantically speaking.

I was on the Seal Team
that killed Bin Laden.

I don't know.

I may look tough
on the outside,

but underneath it all
is a scared little girl

and a lot
of homemade tattoos.

Well, you clearly
have good judgment.

Take a look at this video
and tell me if this finger

looks like it's been
in my boyfriend's mouth.

Hold on, let me grab
my glasses!

Whoa, Becks!
You wanna pick a lane?

We're currently in all three.

Don't distract her
from the video.

Hey--

Oh, like this.

Enough talking.
Show us your ass, white boy.

(blares horn)

So sorry.

I didn't know the horn
would be so loud,

but could you scooch?

Ooh, I wasn't driving?

Man, being a Seal
really messed with my head.

I don't know why I didn't
think of this before,

but my friend, Sloppy Joe,
has a one-engine plane.

He might be able to fly y'all
all the way to L.A.

I'm sorry, what?

A messy sandwich
is gonna fly us to L.A.?

Okay.

Sloppy was
an old high school crush

I never had the guts
to go for.

Man was a legend there.

He was a senior for nine years.

Thanks,
Becky With the Good Hair.

And you'll find someone,
I'm sure.

You just gotta go for it.

That's what she keeps
telling me.

I know, but she will.

I don't think we've
formally met, Sloppy Joe.

I'm Caroline Channing.

They'll be reporting
our deaths together.

You're on your own there.

They reported mine
five years ago.

We're on a ghost plane?
Awesome!

Just curious, will there
be a beverage service?

You want some of my beer?

That's all right, you already
spilled most of it on me.

I bet that's
why they call him sloppy.

Nope, my landings are a mess.

Caroline,
look at the bright side.

How?
None of the lights work.

We're on our way to L.A.,

and sloppy took Randy's
voucher as payment.

And then rolled
a nice, fat joint with it.

You bet I did.

-Whoa!
-Ride the lightning!

Yee-haw!
Do it back.

Let me hear you say,
"Yee-haw!"

BOTH: Yee-hawwww!

I'm just glad you found me.

I was about to build
a hut for the night.

I thought you said you didn't
pick up strange men.

I didn't.

Until a new friend convinced me
I gotta take a chance.

How fast can this old rig go?

This old rig
can go all night, baby.

Doesn't answer my question
at all,

but let's do the damn thing.

This flight's a lot bumpier
than I thought it was gonna be.

Speaking of bumps,

y'all don't have any blow,
do you?

Yeah, that's what
this flight needs,

a more jittery pilot.

-Wow.
-Oh!

Randy just posted a new video.

Eh, buffer faster!

Ugh, do you get
any bars up here?

If I did, I wouldn't be
asking you for cocaine.

(screams)

Never mind, don't need it.

We're going down.

Going down?
My least favorite expression.

And now I hate it even more.

At least in this version
of going down

you don't have
to spoon afterwards.

-Oh, my God!
-Ah!

Caroline, amazing news.

You found parachutes?

Or that part of the wing
that tore away?

Ha, oh, no, we're goners.

But Silver Linings Playbook,

that finger belonged
to Randy's mom!

She's visiting him on set.

Ah, and she's not even
that cute.

I am gonna be so mad at you
in heaven.

You think I'm going to heaven?

(chuckles)
She thinks I'm going to heaven.

(both laugh)

Plane's too heavy.
We gotta drop some weight.

I knew those curly fries at
the truck stop were a mistake,

but they didn't offer
a healthy alternative.

-Hold this.
-What? Ohh!

Hey, Sloppy,
the sky is that way!

I like this, too.

This suitcase has gotta go.

No, all my clothes are in there.

All of our money!
Our credit card!

There is no way that
that one tiny suitcase

is causing all these problems
with your plane.

Very well,
perhaps I overpacked.

Beer me.

(bell dings)
Pick up!

Unless that's
a huge problem for you.

That's it.

I'm gonna tell you
the same thing

that I told Pooters

when they added pants
to the uniform.

I quit.

You quit?

No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

You're fired.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah!

Have I been a bad waitress?

The naughtiest.

Uh, they're not gonna have sex
in a restaurant, are they?

Well, it wouldn't be
the first time.

Hell, it wouldn't be
the eighth time.

Pick up, Oleg.

Oh, yeah, man.
This is happening.

And that's when I married
my high school sweetheart.

Well, she was in high school.
I was 38.

Another terrific story, Sloppy.

Almost makes me forget
we have no money,

no clothes, and we're getting
zero mileage for this flight.

Silver Linings Playbook,
though.

Little Randy update.

Max, I don't care
how expensive it is.

You are going to therapy
when we get back.

Well, that's a wrap on
the first day of filming

here in Austin, Texas.

Or as they say
around these parts,

don't tess with Mexas.

Whoa.

Don't drink
on a scorpion bite.

The man ain't wrong.

Wait, so Randy's
not in Los Angeles?

He's in Texas.

Wow, you're a bad stalker, Max.

Sloppy,
hang a Ralph or a Louie.

Whatever gets us to Texas.

Eh, there's two things
that Slop won't do.

Alert the proper authorities
of my flight pattern

or step foot in Texas.

You need to make
your own way there.

I'll drop you here.
I gotta whiz anyway.

Ah! Drop us here?

Whiz?
What does that mean?

Uh, I think it means
I'm jumping out

of another plane this month.

You know what?
I miss the diner.

Max, Caroline, I have announcement.

You're actually much shorter
and are walking on stilts?

I have made a special menu

for tomorrow's
Valentine's night dinner.

Han, that's so romantic.

Yeah, romantic and wrong.

This place isn't
When Harry met Sally.

It's "When Harry met Salmonella."

Max, Club Sandwich.

And heads up... I lost a band-aid.

Theme menu means
I can charge one bigger price,

like in top restaurants.

See?
"Prick fix."

Oh, Han, it's pronounced "prix fixe."

Have you seen our chef?

It's definitely "prick fix."

Tomorrow night,

Cupid will come
to Williamsburg diner.

Didn't have the heart
to tell him Cupid is dead.

Yep, hit by a mack truck

crossing
the Brooklyn-Queens expressway...

His fat, diapered baby ass

splattered all over the windshield.

I love Valentine's Day.

That's your reaction?
I killed Cupid.

You're either romantic or not.

I'm not even going to try
to convince you.

Oh, he's dead.
And the proof...

When's the last time you knew
anyone who fell in love?

Real love, like Ice Loves Coco.

How about them?

They've been holding hands and
romantic whispering all night.

Their romantic whispering
goes like this.

"I own nipple clamps."

Plink!
Cupid's not dead.

Plink!
There goes his little arrow.

Plink, plink!

Clamp, ouch!
Clamp, ouch!

Clamp, clamp!
Ouch, ouch!

{pub}Max, since it's just after midnight,

Well, judging from
that smile on your face,

I'd say it's a finger-sized hole
in your apron.

Candy hearts!
Here, hold out your hand.

Let's get our heart on.

I'm way ahead of you.

"Be mine"... classic.
What's yours say?

"Caroline Channing is lame.

"I hate you for giving me this.

Valentine's Day is the worst."

Ooh, cinnamon.
Mmm.

Good evening, Earl.

My, my, my, Sophie,

seeing you in that dress
makes my heart race.

Two scoops of ice cream
in a one scoop cone.

Oh, Earl, you make me smile.

I wish we had black people in
Poland when I was growing up.

Too bad.

We really would have enjoyed
segregation and Hitler.

Oh, hi, building neighbors.

Well, I was just driving by,
and since it was raining,

I thought I could offer you two girls

a ride home in my town car.

The last time
someone offered me a ride,

I ended up in
a drainage pipe in Jersey.

Sophia, you rent a town car?

Yes, but only when it's raining,

because, you know, I got hair
extensions and nail extensions,

and, you know, I...
I'm too extended to walk.

Hello.
I saw you from kitchen.

You turned pick-up window
into painting.

Plink!

Velvet painting of nude at counter.

Clamp, ouch!

The girls tell me
you own cleaning service.

I would like to hire you
to clean my house.

Oh, yeah, this is possible.

I will send girl.
What is your address?

I don't want some girl.

I want you to come clean.

Oh, you cannot get me to come.

Oh, I can get you to come.

No, I can no longer come anymore.

No, Max and Caroline can come.

No, no, we're not coming.

So no one can get you to come?

Well, some people
can get me to come...

Just not you.

Hard to get... I like it.

Go get the coats.
I'll get this check.

Here's the last check, Earl.

Oh, Max, can you take care
of that for me, please?

Sure. Why?

Uh, nothing pressing...
Just having a heart attack.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Wait, you're having a heart attack?

Most definitely.

I've had three in my life.
We're old friends.

Earl, you're having a heart attack.

I'll be fine.
Have you seen my tangerine?

I had a tangerine set aside
for my walk home.

Forget the tangerine.

Earl's having a heart attack!

Sophie, we're taking
the town car to the hospital.

Earl, when did the pain start?

When I saw Sophie in that dress.

Oh, hell, no!

Why is this line so long?
Did the new iPhone come out?

Let's just get him over there.

Max, anything you can do
to move this along?

Move!
Celebrity coming through.

Morgan Freeman having a heart attack.

He is having a heart attack.

On a scale of one to ten,
what's your pain?

Uh, two, we were
just in the neighborhood,

looking for a place to have jell-o.

I was talking to Morgan Freeman.

Take him now!

Sir, he has a history
of heart trouble.

All right, we'll get him in.

Earl, go with the nurse.

Damn, it's a man.

We'll be right out here, Earl.
Everything is gonna be okay.

Have a seat and wait.

Look at me, Gingerbread.
If anything happens to him,

I will staple your nut sack
to that chair.

{pub}That's right... it's me again.

For the tenth time, he's fine.

He had a minor attack,
but he's in good hands.

I would know... I had both
of my heart attacks here.

I want to go back there
and see for myself.

Family members only.

Well, I'm his daughter.

Oh, really? It says here
he's 75 years old...

Well, he started late.

And African-American.

He started late with a honky.
I'm one of those combo babies.

Here...

You need proof?

My last name is Black, see?
Max Black.

He's black.
I'm Black.

It'd be dumb if we weren't related.

Can I just get back
to playing Angry Birds?

You are yammering on here
about nothing

while the love of my life
is back there alone and scared.

You said he was your father.

Now he's the love of your life?

He's both.
We're from the South.

Have a seat.

I got us two lattes.
It took forever.

The guy in front of me
missed his kidney transplant

waiting for a mocha frappuccino.

- Any news?
- The same.

But they won't let me back there.
I even told him Earl was my father.

Now's my chance.
Nurse Chewbacca's on the move.

I'm going back there.

If you see anyone about
to notice me sneak by,

draw all the attention to yourself.

Max, I don't know if I can do that.

You're right.
That's kind of my thing.

- Okay, let me think.
- You don't have time to think.

Just throw the coffees
against the wall.

That's ridiculous.

I graduated top of my class
at Wharton.

I can do better than that.

Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender, please.

Oh, my God!

Those were not nonfat.

Earl!

- You in here?
- Max, is that you?

Ain't you sweet?

But you didn't have
to wait around for me.

This is Narcissus.

She's from the Fiji Islands

and gives one hell of a sponge bath.

Hi.
Can we have a minute alone?

Earl, do you think
this is a good time

to have a sponge bath...
I mean, in your condition?

Max, when they look like that,

there's never a bad time
for a sponge bath.

- So are you doing okay now?
- Pretty good.

The doctor said it was a mild one,

but I'm going to have
to stay here a couple nights.

Could you find out how much
extra for me to get my own room?

A private room?

The last time I was
in one of these places,

the guy in the bed next to me
thought he was a parrot

and asked me for crackers
the whole damn night.

Done. I'll get you your own room.

And don't worry about the expenses.

I got a little money
stashed away for a rainy day.

I am not using your money.

But let me guess,
"rainy day" is a strain of weed?

Now you're getting it.

I'll see you later.

Don't die, or I'll kill you.

So what, now you want a private room?

How's he going to pay for that?

Oh, so that old man has
to be the only man in America

who has to pay his medical bills?

Mr. Freeman's done
a lot of successful movies.

I don't think your sarcastic
attitude is very professional.

"Professional"?

Um, an hour ago,
your little thug friend here

threatened to cut me so deep,
I'd have a vagina.

That offer still stands.

She's upset.
And vagina's her go-to.

Well, the only reason
I haven't called security

is they were laid off two weeks ago.

What is your name?

Tig.

And it's fake,
so good luck with that.

Sir, you're representing

the Shecter family wing
of this hospital.

My family knows the Schecters.

In fact, their son David
interns here,

and if I made a call,
he would not be pleased.

If you know them,

why are we talking
to this lump behind a desk?

Suck it, red face!
We're going over your head!

How do you like me now, bitch?

Hey, get your phone.

See if he can swing Earl
a private room.

I think I still have his cell number.

We went out a few times
until I realized he was serious

about going down that pro Bono route.

- Did you two have sex?
- No.

Sweet, that's what you
can offer him for the room.

That's amazing.

Someone found a florist
that delivers after midnight.

That's not so amazing.

I know a guy
named "Sticky Icky" Ricky

who delivers
exclusively after midnight.

You know, I just realized
this is the first Valentine's Day

I won't get flowers from my father.

Aw, that's cute,
with a big old side of creepy.

No, it's sweet.

Every year
from the time I was a baby,

and even when I had boyfriends,

I'd get flowers from my father
with a card that says,

"You'll always be my Valentine."

I got a sweet Valentine from
a guy I liked in high school.

It said, "I'll give you
five bucks to lift your shirt."

Caroline...
Hey, I'll be right with you.

There he is.
Cuter than I remember.

Hey. Wow.

When I heard your voice mail,
I couldn't believe it.

Yes, well, I wasn't sure
you'd want to come down,

because...
you know...

You dumped me two years ago?

Well, "dumped" is a strong word.

Tore my heart out,
shook it in front of my face.

That any softer?

Hate to interrupt
the "perfect white teeth" convention,

but we're in a hurry.

David, this is my friend Max.

A friend of ours was admitted,

and we were hoping
to get him a private room.

Oh, so you're not here to return

my Dartmouth t-shirt
you stole from me.

You gave that to me.

No, I didn't!
I love that shirt.

I feel like I lost custody
of it in a divorce,

and now I'm like a deadbeat dad.

How about the room?
Any chance?

Please.
Pretty please.

Oh, well, since
you said "pretty please,"

I'll see what I can do.

We should be clear.
We can't pay.

We're broke...
both of us.

But I'm sure
you heard that somewhere.

Yeah...

Everywhere.

David, I hope your family
didn't lose any money

with my father.
Did they?

Nope, still filthy rich.

And I can do my best to burn
some filthy off that rich,

by getting your friend a V.I.P. room.

I'll just drop some names.

By that, I mean my own.

Shouldn't be a problem.

I love Jews.

Yeah, we're generous.
Spread the word.

Uh, if you wouldn't mind
giving Narcissus my whereabouts?

Did you see the look on
that desk lump's big, red face

when I pushed you by him?

I did, but I think
throwing him the finger

was a tad out of line.

Wow, Dr. David really hooked us up.

Yeah, this is like an episode
I.C.U. Edition.

So, Earl, what do you think?

Good lord, is that a Matisse?

- I believe so.
- Then, mama, I'm home.

{pub}Here, ladies, put
these suckers in your station.

I think I might get
a late Valentine dinner crowd.

You also think you might
get a late growth spurt,

but that's not happening either.

At best,
you'll get three single girls

waddling over at midnight
to cry into some tapioca.

True.
I need to cut the crap.

Valentine's dinner is bust.

And look, I have sacrificed
my manhood for no cash value.

But your wings are adorable.

Yes, but matching panties
are suffocating the boys.

Come on, close early.

We've only got
one table of twi-hards.

I want to go see Earl.

Oh, what the hell?
I love my man Earl, too.

So screw it.
Let's fly over there.

Ooh, this isn't like
the hospitals in Poland.

The lights are working.

Okay, sit down.
I'll take you in one at a time.

All right, Cupid, you're first.

Oh, don't wake him.
Go back out.

Angels.
Oh, lord, no.

Thank God it's you, Han.

I saw the wings,
and I thought heaven was filled

with chunky Chinese cherubs
and no jazz.

Oh, okay, great.
I'll see you in five.

I'm gonna go meet Dr. David.

Oh, wait a second.

If you're going to go meet man,
you need lip gloss.

Oh, thanks, Sophie.

Oh, no, no, no, no.
Okay.

I have Valentine gift
I want to give you.

Oh, hepatitis "C"?

Happy Valentine's Day.

Look at me.
Now look at you.

Now look at me again.

Does this look right to you?

Hard to get... I like it.

Oh, hey.
So how's your friend doing?

Good.
And thanks for that V.I.P. room.

He feels like a million bucks,
which I'm sure is what it costs,

so I brought you
a little thank-you gift.

That is not my Dartmouth shirt.

No, that's held hostage
at the townhouse.

This says Williamsburg.
That's where I live now.

No way.
That's where I live.

Yeah, I moved there
just to piss my father off,

but I wound up loving it.

I wound up loving it, too.

Hey, maybe we could see
each other there sometime...

You know, go out?

Yeah, I don't think so.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what?

Look, Caroline,
it's been really great

getting to reconnect with you, but...

I don't see this happening again.

Oh.

I mean, it's my parents.

With your father in prison,
the whole scandal,

I could never bring you home.

Not even just
to piss off your father?

I mean, me dating Caroline Channing...
What would people think?

I hope you understand.
Oh, hey, thanks for the tee.

Nice of everyone to stop by.

Didn't see Caroline.
She busy tonight?

Oh, no, she's here.

She's out there running around,
trying to swing a boyfriend situation

with her doctor friend
who got us the V.I.P. hook-up.

What about you, Max?

No sweetheart on Valentine's Day.

I worry about you.

Be nice if you had someone special.

I already do.

Ah, Max, I'm only going to be
around another 30 or 40 years.

You better widen the net a bit.

Visiting hours are up.
Friends have to leave.

She can stay, nurse.
She's family.

Earl, I'm family?

Yes, and the best kind of family.
You don't want my money.

Hey, Earl.
You look really good.

So did you and Dr. Dave
do it in a hospital closet?

All very "Grey's Monotony"?

No, that won't be happening.

I asked him out and
he said he could never date me,

because of my father
and "what would people think?"

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what?

I feel like I was just hit

by the same mack truck
that killed Cupid.

Well, somebody's about
to get hit by a truck...

A Max truck.

Hey, you, Dr. I-Forget-Your-Name.

How?
It's written on every wall.

Okay, Dr. Exit.

What is wrong with you?
Doctors are supposed to be sensitive.

I mean, it's Valentine's Day,
and she has nothing.

Couldn't you be like
every other guy on the planet

and just lead her on
and not call her the next day?

That is the decent thing to do.

And for the record, she is
so hopped up on candy hearts,

you would have gotten some
tonight, fo' sho!

You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

Well, I guess nobody knows me
better than you,

girl I've never met before.

And now I would like to speak
to the pro Bono part of you,

who understands
that nothing I just said

should affect that man
in the V.I.P. room.

That was actually
a very cool thing to do.

Earl is fine.
Don't worry.

And as far as Caroline goes,
I'm sorry, but...

Her father hurt a lot of people.

Whatever you put out there
comes back to you.

Ugh.

What now... you gonna threaten
to feed me my nipples again?

No.

Actually, someone just said something

about the things
you do coming back to you,

and I decided the smart move
was to apologize.

Thanks, but it's not necessary.

Actually, you're the nicest
person I've dealt with tonight.

Ugh.
Rough job, dude.

Here, Happy Valentine's Day.

You want to go out sometime?

Why would...

Yeah, give me your number.
I'll call you tomorrow.

Sleeping in
that hospital chair all night

wasn't that uncomfortable.

No, the chairs weren't.

Your sad Valentine whimpering was.

- So how you feeling this morning?
- Pretty good,

considering I survived
the very first Valentine's Day

I didn't get flowers from my father.

Ugh.

So you got one year under your belt.

Don't get so cocky.

You still have
to make 23 more to tie me.

You know, all this time,
I've been feeling sorry for you

'cause you didn't know your father,

but after seeing
how you took care of Earl...

I feel sorry for your father
that he didn't know you.

You would have been
a wonderful daughter.

Don't hold that thought.

I don't want to cry till after
we break open the tapioca.

No, I didn't just win
a beauty contest.

No, these were left
on the front doorstep.

They're both addressed to Caroline.

- Sorry, Max.
- Oh, no, that's cool.

Wouldn't want to break
my winning streak.

Oh, well, just look at it this way.

She got the flowers.
You got the knockers.

All right, girls,

well, I'm off to buy scratchers

before all
the Puerto Ricans get them.

"You'll always be my Valentine.

Love, Daddy."

Aw.

The other one from Dr. Dave?

Change his mind
after I tore him a new one?

It's from my father as well,
but it's written to you.

"Thank you for taking such
good care of my sweetheart.

M. Channing."

That is so sweet.

Roses from a man.

Now I'm starting to get it.

Is it weird that I kind of want
to have sex with your dad?

Plink!

Excuse me, ma'am?

Ma'am?

Well, it happened.

I'm gonna hit a kid.

Would you like to
support my baseball league

for underprivileged youth?

I don't see an underprivileged youth.

I see a young me trying to scam an old me.

Sir?

I'm sorry, I have diabetes.

And I'm not stupid.

Move it along.

It's not a scam!

My friends and I just want to place

to play baseball after school

so we're not hanging on
the streets like rap people.

Kid, I started the candy scam.

I raised $500 for a
homeless bowling league,

AKA pot.

Catch this, Mr. Baseball.

Not the face!

I think I know which team you play on,

and it ain't baseball.


You still shopping on your phone
for things you can't afford?

Who are you? Everyone in America?

I just add things to my
cart without buying them.

Why not buy one Apple watch
when I can not buy two?

It's called dry shopping.

So it's like dry humping,
but you don't get anything?

I'm sorry, Max,

but tomorrow's the anniversary
of when I lost my money

and my peaches-and-cream complexion.

Not my words; "Seventeen" magazine's.

I need a fantasy life.

I mean, I just thought you
were over all that junk.

You thought I was "over" losing $5 billion

and my whole life?

Oh.

I guess I was just over you

talking about it all the time.

You need to let go of your past.

Pickup! Turkey burger... ish.

If you weren't so busy not buying a...

three-bedroom townhouse
on the Upper East Side,

you would've noticed that Mr.
Turkey Burger at table ten's

been checking out your buns.

He is not. He is?

Get in there.

Sex is still free...

For women.

Fine, I'll go over there,

but this better not be a prank,

like when you told me Bette
Midler was at table three

and really wanted to meet me.

It was just some old Jewish lady,

and she was mean.

That was Bette Midler!

Here's your turkey burger.

My friend thinks you're flirting with me,

and you're obviously not,

so if you could just tell her you're not,

that'd be great.

Okay.

I will tell her I am
not flirting with you...

on one condition.

You go see a show with me tomorrow.

I feel tricked.

So... is that a yes?

I hope so,

because I already wrote down my number.

Um... yeah, sure.

I mean, if it's already written down,

I guess I have to go.

I can't believe I didn't
notice he was flirting.

What's wrong with me?

Let me get my list.

Hi, everybody!

Good news!

Oleg and I are getting a surrogate

to carry our baby.

Yeah, doing it the other
way was taking longer

than my stuttering uncle did
to finish his s-s-s-sentence.

Sophie, I hope you're not thinking of me

to be your surrogate.

Just keep in mind,

you won't even let me carry your purse.

You think I'd hire a
surrogate that's older than me?

Come on. No.

Max is helping me interview people

this week in my booth.

This is so exciting.

I wish I got to pick
the person I grew inside.

My mom drank so much during her pregnancy,

I was born wearing a shirt that says,

"It's 5:00 somewhere."

Can we all just admit vaping is smoking?

Anyway, I'm on the list
for whatever this is.

Channing, Caroline.

There you are. The show's $20.

My date put me on the list.

I'm sure he paid for me.

He kind of pursued me pretty hard.

It is, again, a date.

Well, then you're dating a loser...

and you owe me 20 bucks.

What am I spending my
last $20 on right now?

It's a storytelling show.

People telling their personal stories.

It's basically a fun way to find out

which one of your friends had a stepfather

that was so mean.

In lieu of cash, would you accept a tampon?

I have light, regular, super.

Everything you don't feel on your period.

There is nothing funny about my cramps.

I don't get out of bed three days a month.

I'll go call a friend.

So by now I was in high school.

But just when I thought
I'd escaped my bullies,

I met the worst one yet: puberty.

Oh, god.

Thanks for bringing the $20, Max,

and sorry you had to spend another $20.

It figures, on the anniversary
of my father stealing money,

I get ripped off by another guy.

Well, I'm getting that $40 back.

I spent more money
tonight than I did in 2013.

It was a high school dance,

and Rachel Mooney, a popular girl,

pulled down my pants.

That's right.

I got dance-pantsed.

Oh, this guy just went from Tom Cruise

to Tom Snooze.

In the end, what I learned

is that I'm the painter of my life,

and I can paint out
what I don't want to see.

My brushes are mine.

My strokes are mine.

Guess what's not getting stroked tonight.

Old Adam's paintbrush.

That's got to be sarcastic
applauding, right?

'Cause I feel like I
heard, like, a question mark

at the end of the clap.

Thank you, Adam August.

That is the end of our show.

I'd like to thank all of our performers.

You live the stories that we live to hear.

Hey, Caroline.

I know, that was pretty real.

It was real long.

So where are we going for dinner?

Your treat, and she's coming.

Actually, I'm pretty spent emotionally.

Well, we're spent forty-dollars-ally.

It's just one of those nights where...

you leave it all on the stage.

You happen to leave a
couple twenties up there?

Let... let me get something straight.

You gave all of yourself
talking about a couple bullies?

That's not a rough life.
You know that, right?

Well, I know I'm entitled to my truths

and how my truths make me feel.

Yeah, but it's not like
you lost a billion dollars

and your father went to prison
and you had to move in with me.

And I am a way bigger
bully than Rachel Mooney.

Caroline has a rough story.

Again, we can't compare our truths.

I'm sorry, but did all
that really happen to you?

You lost billions?

Five years ago today, in fact.

And with what I lost
tonight, $5 billion, $40.

Well, have you ever considered

telling your story in a safe space?

You mean one of those locations
where you can drop off a baby,

no questions asked?

N... no. No.

No, I mean here.

Telling your story here.

Hey, you know what?

I probably have some fans
waiting for me outside,

so I will leave you be.

You're still here?

Thanks for the offer, but
I'm not really a writer.

Or a person who would come here twice.

Plus, I'm trying to put my story behind me.

All right. Well, think about it.

It pays $50. Here's my card.

You work at Avis?

Oh, uh... Ooh.

That's my other job.

And remember, you have a story to tell.

And sometimes renting a
car is actually cheaper

than a long-term lease, so...

I think you should totally do this.

To finally tell my story
and give it closure?

Yeah, a little of that,
but mostly the 50 bucks.

I'm here for the surrogacy interview.

Max, we got another baby mama.

Look at all these woman
trying to get pregnant.

It's like NBA All-Star Weekend.

Here's my resume, and do you validate?

I've never been validated, so
you're not getting validated.

But I am impressed you have a car,

so have a seat.

Max, I've been working on
my life story for the show.

"As a little girl, I
dreamt of being a princess.

"It wasn't until I lost
everything that I realized...

that's what I'd already been."

What else you got?

Come on, Max, this is important.

I've never told the story
about the day I lost my money,

so it's all very raw.

Okay, but just know,

sometimes things can be too raw,

like that chicken club sandwich that

buck-kaw'd at the table.

Looks like my appearance

on the Brooklyn Small Business podcast

really paid off!

These aren't customers, silly.

These are just women that will
do literally anything for money.

Will any of them wait tables?

Han, can I go work in your office?

I just need to write my life story.

I promise I won't play with your Legos.

You mean those little plastic men

protecting his virginity?

Sophie, ready to meet the
next potential surrogate?

Oh, well, the lady in stall two is out.

Yeah, I just heard her balls hit the water.

Where is Oleg?

Sorry, I was watching a YouTube video

on how to make spaghetti.

Boy, I was way off.

Uh, Sophie?

This is Claire.

You liked that her application
was filled out in pink pen.

Do you mind if I sit down?

My back is killing me.

Yeah, well, your front is killing me.

I mean, what the hell?

I don't know if you're aware of this,

but your "No Vacancy" sign is flashing.

Yes, but once I give this gift

to a lovely same-sex couple in Tribeca,

I would love to carry
your gift into the world.

I've been a surrogate 12 times.

What are you?

A baby PEZ dispenser?

What do you get after 12? A free sub?

Next!

Pregnant 12 times?

Must be like saloon doors down there.

I don't know.

Are you sure you can't spend
more than $200 on this thing?

Because I feel like it's reflecting

in the pool of candidates.

Which one says, "Just
because I'm at my bottom

doesn't mean I can't wear a nice top"?

Even your shirts talk too much.

Max can you be serious?

No, but you sure can.

I read your story, and it is supes serious,

so I took the liberty
of putting some jokes in.

I mean, "Schindler's List" was depressing,

but at least there were still jokes.

You changed my life story?

You got mustard on my life story?

I added a few riffs and had a hot dog.

I think your story is really, really sad,

and it's gonna bum people out,
and that's gonna bum you out,

and that's gonna bum me out.

Well, as I said to Mrs. Shearson,

who directed me in "Cabaret,"

I don't know how I could be much better,

but I'm open to your ideas.

All right, let me hear
some of your funnies.

All right, first of all,

we're gonna sit Han in the front row,

and you're gonna say,

"I'm gonna keep this
short, 'cause this guy did."

Hold for what I have to imagine
is a five-to ten-minute laugh.

Okay, all through this first section,

you're driving right through Snoresville,

and then you take a slight
right into Who-gives-a-crap-town.

The point is you're
driving a 2016 Ford Bore-us.

All right, fine.

I'll put some of your jokes in.

Oh, but I don't want
to attack Anne Hathaway.

Hasn't she been through enough?

And after it was all said and done,

I looked at my vagina...

And my vagina looked at me,

and we shared a knowing glance.

It was as if she was giving me
permission to tell her story.

Thank you, vagina.

And thank you for listening.

I never thought I could get tired

of hearing the word "vagina,"

and yet, here I am.

Hey, tips are kind of low, huh?

How'd you like to make $200,
possibly $250, to have my baby?

What?

You carry stuff anyway.

Just as well.

I didn't want our baby
to have that hair color.

Where's that waitress going?

I need a double.

A double what?

Double anything.

How's everyone doing out there?

Isn't this a wonderful way
to spend a Friday night?

Hmm?

I'm up next.

On a scale of 9 to 10, how do I look?

You look beautiful,

so they're gonna be really surprised

when you have jokes.

And our next storyteller
is here for the first time,

reading a tale so epic
that it should be two tales.

And like the two-tailed Melusina,

a serpent of European folklore...

She is truly a beauty.

What in good God is that man talking about?

Please welcome Caroline Channing.

As he said, my name is Caroline Channing.

That used to mean something special,

and I have learned
through the past few years

that it still does.

My father was Martin Channing,

the most hated man in New York City.

Except for any Time Warner Cable guy...

You know what?

I don't need to look at this.

I know what happened.

I'll never forget it.

You don't forget the day
that you lose yourself.

Oh, boy.

She's off script.

She's gone rogue.

Where's that waitress?

Double his double!

As my driver drove down 5th Avenue

and up to my townhouse,

I saw there was a police
car parked out front.

And at first, I thought,
"Am I being arrested?"

Lip-synching to Ludacris at a stoplight!

But it was my father being arrested.

I saw my father in handcuffs.

There, in that instant,

I went from princess to pariah.

Well, she threw away a perfectly good

"Pariah Carey" joke.

Shh!

Just looking out for my girl here.

Shh!

My perfect world was shattered.

I saw the man who I trusted,

who I believed in more than anyone,

who read me bedtime stories

and taught me how to tie
my shoes with bunny ears...

I saw my father in handcuffs.

He stole my trust,

my belief in people,

my innocence.

If she doesn't say
"virginity," I am leaving.

He stole who I thought I was

and left me to find who I really am.

Thank you.

Nothing?

We got to sneak her out the back door.

You were so sad and triumphant

and... so...

Oh, here come the waterworks!

Caroline,

I know you said you never would,

but you touched me.

That really tugged at my heartstrings...

or cables or wires

or whatever's in here keeping me alive.

Caroline...

Oh, you know what you and I both need?

A hug. Yeah.

Oh...

It's nice, isn't it?

Caroline, that was great!

I'm so glad I inspired
you with my awesome story.

You're still here?

I'm sorry I didn't do your jokes, Max.

You know what?

You didn't need them!

I think people sometimes like to be sad.

That's why there's Adele.

I think I finally got closure.

It's gone, Max.

Love you.

Love your story.

Thanks.

I'm Nina Spiegel.

I found the whole thing riveting.

The ups, the downs, the way-downs.

Ugh, your story had it all.

She's not joining your threesome.

Sorry, that's usually what women want

when they compliment me.

Look, I'd like to talk about
taking this to my studio.

You have your own studio apartment?

Let the wooing continue.

No, it's a film studio.

Warner Brothers.

The Tasmanian Devil Warner Brothers?

I think we can turn
your story into a movie.

Really?

The Caroline Channing story

deserves to live on the big screen

for one to two weeks.

Then On Demand for eternity.

Oh, my God.

Max, isn't this exciting?

I know!

They have Speedy Gonzalez too!

I'm still on hold, Max.

I know Nina's important,

because her assistant has
put me on hold six times

and muted me twice.

Muting you's an option?

Why wouldn't they put that in your manual?

Hi!

Oh, are you kidding?

I love waiting.

Sophie, here's your consolation gnocchi,

for not finding somebody
to get gn-knocked up.

Oh, thanks, Oleg.

Well, at least I have you.

You know what, Sophie?

I'll be the surrogate,

but if my pregnancy boobs
knock over a street lamp,

that's on your insurance.

That's real nice of you, Max,

but if there's anything that I
learned from Caroline's story,

it's that you can't give
up, even if you should.

Oh, so you're gonna keep trying?

No, we're gonna adopt,

and we will cherish this little baby,

even if it's not technically from us.

Yeah, Oleg's right.

I mean, half my hair's not from me,

but I love it just as much as if it were.

They are flying me to Hollywood!

They want to bring me out first class

for a meet-and-greet.

But I told them no.

Are you crazy?

You can't pass up a meet-and-greet.

You can't pass up any kind of meat.

You're anemic.

I switched the tickets for two coach seats.

I want you to come with me!

Who needs to lie flat

when I can be squished
between my best friend

and an obese rabbi in row 36?

We're going to Hollywood!


MAX: Previously
 on "2 Broke Girls"...

I am choosing to take
this disaster as a sign,

and while they're
rebuilding this place

I'm gonna go surprise Randy
and try to rebuild us!

Fine, use my car,

but I'm going to be driving it.
I'm coming with you.

I finally got
the gas pedal extension

where I like it.

I'll just call AAA.

Cool.
Later, hater.

HAN:
Wait, you're really leaving?

Who leaves someone
on the side of the road

in the middle of nowhere?

My friend, Sloppy Joe,

has a one-engine plane.

He might be able to fly y'all
all the way to LA.

Well, that's a wrap
on the first day of filming

here in Austin, Texas.

So Randy's not in Los Angeles?

He's in Texas?

Wow, you're a bad stalker, Max.

There's two things
the Slop won't do.

Alert the proper authorities
of my flight pattern

or step foot in Texas.

I'll drop you here.

[both scream]

[thunder crashes]

When I agreed
to follow you cross-country

to chase your ex-boyfriend,

I didn't realize
I'd be thrown out of a plane,

scavenging for my belongings

and fighting a snake
for my favorite pants.

[snake rattles and hisses]

You can have them, sir!

Ah!
Found my toothbrush.

[gasps]
Max, that's disgusting.

Oh, you're right.
This isn't mine.

[gasps]
Ah, found a purse...

[gasps]
Under this syringe.

Anything in there?

Uh...

nah, pretty tapped out,

which is too bad

'cause you could use
a two-day heroin nap.

I meant my bag.

Look what else survived!

Ah-ha!

My Popchips!

Only to meet an unfortunate end.

Oh, no, Max, my wallet.

Mm, yeah, I know.
You've aged a lot

since that license picture.

No, it's gone.

All of our cash

and our credit cards
were in there.

What are we gonna do?
I'm freaking out.

Nah, nah, nah, calm down.

Caroline will
get us out of this.

Oh, wait.
You're Caroline.

I'm calling the diner for help.

[phone rings, chimes]
CAROLINE: Han... [garbled]

Caroline, we don't have
a good connection,

and not just because
we're dueling Scorpios.

Peek-a-boo!

-I see you!
-[laughing]

Oleg.

All right, now do it
with Barbara.

Han, we had
all of our belongings

thrown out of a private plane.

HAN: Caroline,
you're cutting out.

All I heard was "private plane."
Brag much?

No, we need to get to Texas,

so can you please put $500
in my PayPal account?

What?
You have $500?

Did I call you to gloat

when I bought
this snazzy new vest?

I'm putting you on speaker.

[phone beeps]
CAROLINE: Private plane...

Have...credit card...

[cell phone beeping]

We lost her.

Or maybe her butler
snatched her phone from her.

[quietly]
Oh, God.

He hung up.

Max, can we just go back to that
terrible place we call home?

That mountain lion
is wearing my new blouse.

-And here she comes!
-[gasps]

Keep the tags on
if you wanna return it.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[cash register bell dings]

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I'm calling
the credit card company

to send us new cards.

They're used to hearing me cry.

So is the unfortunate family

that sat behind us
at "Zootopia."

If animals can all get along,
so can we.

Look, once we get our cards,

we'll be on our way
to Randy in Texas--

and what was in this
for me again?

5 1/2 near-death experiences?

[crying] Hi, Visa.
It's me, Caroline.

My cards were stolen.

I've seen backs of vans

with better candy selections.

This is a disgrace
to the name Gas and Gobble.

How do you even wake up
in the morning?

My alligator licks my face.

Oh, my God, Max.

Whoever stole our credit cards
maxed them out.

They spent the $1,500
we had left.

No way.

Someone just spent $1,500

on phone cards and cigarettes.

His name was Caroline Channing.

[gasps]
What?

That's my name!

Ah, you got a dude's name.

Ugh, we were robbed.
Police!

BOTH: Where!

Max, I am tired
and I'm hungry

and I can't find a mirror,

but I am sensing a disturbance
in my hair.

We have to go home!

But we have to go to Texas.

Randy needs me.

He's saying it
on his Snapchat story.

Still on the movie set.

Pretty lonely,
so if anyone would respond

to my Words With Friends
request,

I promise to let you win,

and if you're ever in Texas...

why?

See?
He's begging me to come there.

But we have no money
to get to Texas.

Wrong.

I've got $11 in this one

and $32 in this one.

Lefty's been holding back
as per usual.

So your 43 boob dollars

are gonna get us to Texas?

Don't rule out
my roll of butt quarters.

Sweaty but ready.

All right,
can y'all folks lock up?

I got to make a riverboat

before it takes off
to New Orleans.

My cousin Tim put
a voodoo curse on me.

I got to talk to him
about removing it.

Caroline,

New Orleans is close to Texas.

The Hamburglar says so
on my McDonald's placemat,

and he would never lie

unless it's about stealing
delicious hamburgers.

I'm confused.
Do you want hamburgers

or do you wanna
take that riverboat?

Obviously, the dream scenario
is both.

Ah, thank you very much.

Max, people have tickets.

You have to pay to get on this--

what I'm positive will be
my sixth near-death experience.

So bend over and unclench.

We need those butt quarters.

Who are you?
My mother at a church carnival?

Have your tickets ready, please.

All we have to do
is act like we belong.

Do I at least get to have
an adorable Southern accent?

No accent.

[mimics Southern accent]
Well, I do declare

that is mighty disappointing.

Just follow my lead.
It's time to touch strangers.

Hey, you got a permit
for those guns?

Well, I say,

you got a permit for

that light-up yo-yo?

I have a girlfriend.

Keep walking, buster.

Max, the riverboat doesn't get
to New Orleans for two days

and we have nowhere to sleep.

Ooh, but there is

a "Whittle Your Own Banjo"
workshop at 5:00.

I have whittle-to-no interest
in that.

Ooh, it says they have
the loosest slots around.

I guess the Darby sisters
from my hometown are here.

I did see a bunch
of lounge chairs

over by the swamp exhibit.

I guess we could
sleep there tonight,

and then the next night,

well, hopefully we'll be dead.

[thumping]
Come on, red!

[gasps] Max, no!
That's all of our money!

No more bets.

Oh, that is so stupid,

and not cute stupid like

when you thought
Velcro grew in nature.

And red is the winner.

Well, rootin' tootin'!

I always bet on red
because my last name's Black,

and that's ah-not been a winner.

Okay, now that we've
doubled our money,

-maybe we should stop.
-Come on, red!

[gasps]

-No more bets.
-No!

I didn't even get to touch it
before you lost it.

Why do you hate having things?

Red again.

Just call me Al Roker
'cause I'm making it rain.

Max, we're winning at something.

Don't just stand there
looking pretty, toots.

Order daddy some wings.

Oh, my God, I look pretty

and I get to flag down
a waitress.

Waitress!

I'll have a sarsaparilla

and some wings for big daddy.

[cell phone ringing]

[gasps]
Sophie's calling.

Pfft, like I'm gonna get it.

Well, Caroline's not answering.

Executive decision.

Horses can eat
a bunch of pudding.

My cousin from Chernobyl
had a dog this size.

He had three legs.

My cousin, not the dog.

Something good did
come out of Chernobyl.

Excuse me?

How much do you charge
for pictures with him?

Oh, it depends.

How nude do you want him?

Ew.

We mean for our kids...

with the horse.

I don't think
the "ew" was necessary.

You don't know
what you're missing.

I mean, we're just walking him
for our friend.

We'll give you $10 each.

Sold to the woman who...

[chuckles wryly]
"Doesn't" wanna see me naked.

Come on, 18!

Which is also the title
of my adult film debut.

Mine would have been called,

"Might As Well,
I'm 24."

Excuse me, Mr. Moustache?

Could you stop feeling my ankle
with your toes?

I guess that's a no.

-Oh, 18 winner.
-[gasps]

We won!
I'm rich!

Now you have no shot with me.

Stay close, sweet cakes.
You're good luck.

Here, buddy.
Buy yourself some new sandals,

and a round of mouthwash
for the table.

All right, place your bets.

I placed mine
on a liberal arts degree.

That's why I'm here.

[thumping]
Let it ride.

Max, maybe we should quit
while we're ahead

since we've never been before.

Aren't you worried
that we might...

18 again!

Keep winning and never die!

Let's go with four.

The number of men
who have flashed me

since I've been
on this riverboat.

Lucky four!

No more bets.

[horn blows]
all: Whoa!

Who's driving this thing?

Gary Busey?

Oh, four.
No winners.

Yes, winners.
We had four,

but then the boat
moved our chips.

Yeah, and it also
spilled my soda.

So like I said:
No winners.

Sure, we lost all our money,

but at least you got
to see some dongs.

Hey, Sophie, it's me Car--ah!

I fall for her...

[mimics Sophie]
"Hello, this is Sophie"

outgoing message
every time.

We need them to send that money.

Oh, thank God.
Hi, Sophie, it's--

[screams]

What's going on here?

Are you selling pony rides
with Chestnut?

Yes, but you got to wait in line
with the other kids.

No, you don't, buddy.

Up you go, champ.

Get your hands off me!

I don't want my picture taken!

Right now.

The girls asked me
to make sure you're feeding him,

and here you are pimping him out

like...

this isn't my wheelhouse.

Famous pimps, anyone?

What?

How dare they not trust us.

This stops now!

Unless your boy, Han,

gets a little taste
of the horse-play.

Here.

What's going on here?

Nothing.

I know a shady deal
when I see one.

I was one of the loudest voices
against the Louisiana Purchase.

Earl, what are you even
doing here?

I thought you lived
at the diner.

Well, thank God the girls
asked me to check on Han

checking on you too

'cause now this black male

is about to blackmail you.

[gasps]

Okay, Earl's in too.

At a lesser percentage
because odds are

he'll forget about all of this
momentarily.

- Excuse me, manager.

We've been wronged,

and not just generally by life.

I don't know who to complain to
about that.

Is there a problem over here?

I'm the pit boss.

I also do the mentalist show

in the John Wilkes Booth
Ballroom.

Still lots of tickets available.

Yes, there's a problem here.

We just got cheated
out of our winnings,

and I was already cheated
out of much of my 20s,

but again,
probably not your department.

Why don't I send a complimentary
bottle of champagne

to your room?

And by "champagne" I mean wine,

and by "bottle" I mean box.

Uh, you know what?
We'll take it here.

Would there happen to be
a 7 Eleven merlot?

Max, wine in our room
sounds so much better.

We can relax

and focus on each other
for once.

Mm, great.
What's the room number?

Oh.

I think she means oh-six.

I don't think so.

That room is still
an active crime scene.

[clears throat]

Stowaways, huh?

I'll have the Coast Guard
come and pick you up.

They're already coming
for that guy.

I didn't wanna
strip my clothes off

and try to drive the boat.

It was that voodoo curse.

Damn you, Tim!

Look, dude,
if you're really a mentalist,

you'll know that I need to get
to Texas to see my boyfriend.

[grunts]

I can tell that
you're telling the truth.

Please, there has got to be
a way we can work something out.

We'll do anything.

Well, she will.
I'll do over the shirt stuff.

Your shirt.

If you take off that hat.

Is there anywhere in the world

where I don't have
to be a waitress?

Hooters?

Thanks.

I'm a cocktail waitress
on the Mississippi River.

This is a worse vacation

than the one
with Ed Helms in it.

[grunts, chuckles]
Sorry, sir.

Looking for some cell service.

Hey, why don't I sit in your lap

and you can drive me around?
Two birds, one stone?

[scoffs] I wasn't
that attracted to you anyway.

I'm gonna go try
to find some reception.

Seeing Randy miserable is
the only thing

that'll cheer me up right now.

[gasps]
Maybe he's crying.

One vodka for the gentleman
with the neck tattoo,

and two vodkas for the lady

who's into that sort of thing.

[gasps]
Thank you.

Your catfish tower's on its way.

It takes two to carry
the cocktail sauce lagoon.

Everything on double-zero.

Which has to be the Yelp rating
of this boat.

Excuse me?

Could I get
a white wine spritzer?

Oh, come on, Vera.
We share a locker.

Oh, double-zero.

-[gasps]
-Winner.

Yes, I'm a winner again!

Suck it, river people.

What is going on over here?

Employees are not allowed
to gamble.

Or, as of last week,
sexually harass each other.

Thanks a lot, Craig.

Ugh.

Poindexter in the radio room

wouldn't let me use
the satellite phone.

Also, I broke
your satellite phone.

That is it.
You're fired.

That's the worst news I've heard

since you said "you're hired."

There's a tug coming
to swap out the toilet tanks.

I am putting you two on it.

As captains?

Or should I say, crap-tains?

Hey, everybody!

I got spinning wheels
for Barbara's carriage.

Now's it's not just her attitude

that's gangster.

Uh...can y'all keep it down,
please?

I'm trying to set up
my new wireless headphones.

Gonna make my WalkMan
sound amazing.

This is ridiculous.

I'm trying to keep things
on the down-low,

and you three went
on the biggest shopping spree

since Ellen
at a Men's Wearhouse sale.

Oh, wait a minute.

Wait a minute.

Han, why are you taller
than the counter?

Just been eating right
and getting enough sleep.

Yeah, something's weird.

You're almost the height
of an adult penguin.

Fine!
I treated myself to lifts.

I was sick of being nose to butt
with everyone on the subway.

Check out Caroline's Instagram.

Looks like they're
in more trouble than I was

the last time I tried
to put on overalls.

Ooh, they're on a tugboat
filled with toilets,

and she writes, "Help.

Please send money."

So...

quick unfollow?

Or sleep on it
and pow-wow in the morning?

No. We have to help them.

I lost the cord
to these headphones anyway.

Oh, still got toilet boat legs.

Ugh, this place reeks of bait.

Oh, no, wait. That was me.
My mouth was open.

More importantly,

I finally have enough bars
on my phone

to stalk Randy on Snapchat.

Oh, great!
All of our problems are solved,

except for food, money,
and a place to sleep.

So negative.

Have you not seen
the sneeze-guard-less

bait shop salad bar?

Speaking of pathetic,

let me just check in
on poor Randy.

Just another lonely night
 here in Texas...

with all my new best friends!

-ALL: Hey!
 -Ha-ha!

Hey! I was up next for Twister!

Classic Jake.

-Hey!
 -Hey!

Ha. I'm sure he's
just putting on a happy face.

That's obviously the only way
to handle Jake.

Deep down, I can tell
he's genuinely upset.

I'm just genuinely happy
 right now.

Ugh, this salad bar stinks.

No, wait. That's me again.

[phone chimes]

[gasps]
Oh, my God, Max!

The diner people put money
in our PayPal account!

They say it's from Chestnut,

but he's not allowed on the
Internet when we're not home.

I can't believe it.

Me neither.

The diner people are
all we have in this world.

And I used to have a closet
just for scarves.

No! That Randy's happy
without me.

What am I doing?

I'm dragging you
all over the country

after some guy who isn't even
interested in me anymore.

This is my worst idea since I
told DeNiro to stick to comedy.

So, what are you saying?

I'm saying this is a mistake.

Let's just go home
like you said

after that hyena
knocked you to the ground

and tried to hump you.

Can I get $12 on number four?

And on which aisle can I find
tucking tape?

Okay, I will just have
these Slim Jims and a Ho-Ho.

It's not like I have to fit
into couture today.

[Caroline gasps]

-Stop hitting me.
-Stop hitting me!

Girls, stop fighting.

I hate to see women
fighting each other.

Well, unless, of course,

it's Hoda and Kathie Lee

over the last glass
of chardonnay.

That's RuPaul!

From RuPaul's Drag Race!

We love your show.
We used to watch it

through our neighbor Jeff's
window.

But then he met Dean,

and now all they do is
cook naked.

So we just watch that now.

Oh, you poor babies.

So, why the cat fight?

Did she steal
your size 12 stilettos?

'Cause I would cut a bitch
for that.

We were actually
on our way to Texas

to see if she and her ex could
patch things us.

No, we're not going
to Texas.

We're going back home.

Sometimes you got
to admit defeat...

and that there is a very live
junebug in this macaroni salad.

Oh, no, honey. I do not like
the sound of defeat.

You want to know where I'd be
if I'd given up on my dreams?

Living right down the road

managing a Dress Barn,

driving 400 miles in a ball gown
to sing karaoke.

I would not be the supermodel
of the world

that I am today,

okay?

Hello.

Hey, listen. I'm driving
to Texas if y'all want a ride.

Well, shall we sashay away?

You know that's copyrighted.

Say it again,
and you owe me $12,000.

-Aah!
-Ah! Shotgun!

I'm sitting next to RuPaul!

No. I'm sitting
next to RuPaul.

* *

(cash register dings)

(rock music)

* *

That's it for tonight.

Time to count the tip jar.

Hand condom.

I can't believe you.

Using protection
is so five years ago.

This is williamsburg.

There's a good chance
even the dollars have herpes.

Well, if those singles
have herpes,

they should just lie
about it till they get married

like everybody else does.

Oh, good, you're still open.

Oh, yes, we are.
What can I get you?

Everything in the register.

Oh, my god.
It's a hipster hold-up.

Hand it over.
I have a gun.

Well, I have a death wish
so that's not gonna work.

Look, pal, we work
at this cupcake window

from 2:00 to 4:00,
six nights a week,

and that is after eight hours
of slinging hash

at the diner next door
for lousy minimum wage,

which a bunch of rich
politicians out in--help me out.

Washington.

What she said--
don't wanna raise.

Then, we walk home to our
illegal one bedroom apartment,

get three hours
of nyquil induced sleep

before we have to get back up
and share a bowl

of Spanish language cheerios.

It's the same thing but
the "c" wears a sombrero.

So, no, I am not about to give
you our hard-earned money.

And if you're gonna shoot me,
better aim good.

'Cause if you miss,
I will climb over this counter,

tear off your head,
and it'll be our new tip jar.

Yeah, I just robbed pizza pizza.

Here's a $20.

Have a good night.

I have a way with people.

(peter bjorn and John)
¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ¶

look, I just saw that
our cupcake competition,

"Brooklyn bitty bites,"
went out of business.

Yup, it's being changed
into a medical marijuana store.

I already have
my hole-punch card.

Buy four brownies
and the fifth buzz is free.

Brooklyn bitty bites bit it!

Yeah! We won!

Eat it, red haired lady
and your Asian daughter!

Max, them going down
right after the death

of the cupcake giant,
"crumbs," is scary.

It's like there's
a serial killer out there

coming after cupcakes.

Well, he should be easy
to outrun,

'cause that'll be
one fat Dexter.

Seriously, we have
a big problem.

I'm back!

And there's our little problem.

Wow, you don't usually see
the ventriloquist's dummy

out of his suitcase alone.

Hello, Earl.
Hello, Caroline.

Hello, reason I do two hours
of phone therapy

every Wednesday before work.

So, did you all miss me?

You were gone?

'Cause I swear I
just saw you yesterday.

Wait, maybe that was a cat.

I was gone, people!

To San Francisco
for a convention.

The restaurant
and diner association.

"Radass."

You were at something called
"radass" in San Francisco?

Are you sure
it wasn't "redass"?

I am not gay.
I'm restaurant curious.

I discovered an exciting
new item for our menu.

No way.
No new menu additions.

I already lie awake in bed

worrying about how high
the food bar is here.

[Bell dings]

Pick up!
Pulled pork.

And it's good
'cause before I pulled it,

I gave it a dry rub.

It's $4 toast.

$4 toast?

That's $5 more than
our toast is worth.

Delicious, homemade
artisan bread.

At first, I was reluctant to put
something so big in my mouth.

But the hot butter
drizzling down my chin

was my sticky reward.

Han, that toast is
trendy foodie food.

It'll die here,
like my soul did.

Our customers are
just plain, normal people.

Hey, everybody!

And Sophie.

Guess what?

78 guys want me
on tinder.

[Phone dings]

Oh, 79!

[Phone dings]

Now it's 80!

How long have you
been on tinder?

Ten minutes!

[Phone dings]

Oh, look,
oh, my gosh!

This guy's a plumber.
Are you kidding me?

Yes, that's a match!

[Phone dings]

And this guy isn't even
wearing a shirt!

That's another big yes!

Oh, gosh, girls,
I'll be over here,

looking at boys
in my booth.

Hey, I know a girl who met
her husband on tinder.

No, wait, she saw her husband
on tinder.

[Phone dings]

Hey, are wheelchairs sexy?

I guess it depends
on who's in one.

I say no.

[Phone chirps]

Hold the presses.

I just got a new tweet
from my gal,

Kim Kardashian.

Oh, she just bought her
some new boots in Manhattan.

Kim Kardashian is epic.

She was on the cover of vogue.
She's on fire.

So? I've been on fire.

That's the last time I try
witchcraft for the free snacks.

I love the Kardashians.

They're like the Kennedys
but with bigger asses.

Text me next time.

This whole talking thing
is insane.

Hi!

Who would I talk to
about finding the owner

of Max's homemade cupcakes?

That's Max.
I'm Caroline.

We're the owners
of this store.

And about four pairs of socks.

Great. Wonderful.
Such a cute shop.

Would you be interested
in having a popular--

yes.

I didn't finish my sentence.

Sorry, I just haven't heard
the word "popular" in so long.

Oh, yeah, she's over.

She's the blockbuster video
of people.

Would you be interested
in having

a popular reality show
filmed here?

Y--
[Phone rings]

I'm so sorry.
I have to take this.

Just a minute.

What?

Just say it already.
Come on.

Max, this is great.
Think of the exposure.

I wonder which reality show
it is.

Ooh, maybe 16 and pregnant
is doing

a "where are they now" segment
and they found me.

Or that one about you,
"here comes honey boobless."

Do you have any idea who I am?

You just do what I say
or you are out!

Okay.

Mommy loves you.

Sorry, my baby's Nigerian.

I mean, if you're gonna live
here, learn the language.

Jeez.

So what are we thinking?

We'd love it. We're in.
What show?

Keeping up with
the Kardashians.

Finally, god opens a door.

And I'm closing a window.

Max!

She's overwhelmed.
Big fan.

Do you have a card?

Mm-hmm.
And listen, text me.

don't call.
It freaks me out.

Just give me
one good reason

why we shouldn't keep up
with the Kardashians.

I'll give you five good reasons.

Kim, kamber, klondike...

And the little ones,
krispy and kreme.

Not even close.

Fine.
Kim, kooky, kool aid,

and the little ones,
kaptain and kangaroo.

It's Kim, Kourtney, Khloe,
Kylie, and Kendall.

That mother has some nerve,
naming a kid

who's probably never even read
a book "kindle."

We need this.

Everyone watches keeping up
with the Kardashians.

It's like
dancing with the stars,

but without the stars.

So, dancing with the stars.

Okay, tell me one good thing
about this show that I hate,

'cause I've never seen it.

Well, it's all
about this family

and their struggle to...

Keep up.

Yeah, okay.
I've never seen it either.

Sophie, thank you so much
for letting us come up

after work to watch your TV.

Max turned our old one
into a bong.

That was another time
I was on fire.

Well, which episode do you want
to watch?

"Kim gets a new hat."

Or "Kylie cries at Coachella"?

Or "Khloe gets a bikini wax"?

Now that one's a classic.

How many of these
do you have dvr'd?

Well, I got 17 on this TV

and 53 on the one
in the bedroom.

I like to go to sleep
with the sound of Kim's voice.

It's so comforting
when she says,

[as Kim kardashian]
This is super awkward."

And you know, sometimes she
arches her back

when she says it, like this.

"This is super awkward."

This is super awkward.

You know, I bet you
if I stayed in Poland,

my sisters and I would have
had our own show.

It would've been called,
keeping up with the kachinskis.

It's too bad we all didn't live
to see 20.

It's not cute.

[Indistinct chatter on tv]
You know I need someone
to make me laugh.

Where's Kim?
Kim is always late.

[Indistinct chatter]

Stop!

Thanks, guys.

That's it, we're done.
Money.

Hey, get the hell out!
It's morning!

I know, I know,
but we couldn't stop

watching them do nothing.

This show is freaking genius!

Is the blonde one crying?

Mm-hmm.
Kris and Kim are in Vienna

and someone stole
kris's bottega bag

and her Chanel clutch
with the matching pumps

that she bought in Paris.

All right, well, I have to go
take my morning tinkle.

But when I come back,
I want you two to be out of here

because I need that swing
for my exercises.

We have to do this show.

It'll be so great
for our business.

The only way we'd get
more exposure

is if Orlando bloom and bieber
bitchslapped each other

in front of our shop.

Who cares about our business?

I want that mother to adopt me!

Her kid makes a sex tape,
she turns it into millions.

The only thing my mother
ever did with my sex tape

was copy it
and give it to her boyfriend.

I'm so excited.

Max, this is what I look like
when I'm happy.

You've never seen it.

Please call me by my new name,
khlamydia Kardashian.

don't say anything stupid
like that.

I won't have to say anything.

Kris will see me
and recognize me

as one of her own
with my lips, my boobs,

and my willingness to live
in some place called calabasas.

They're here.
My life changes now!

This is what I
look like happy.

You've never seen it.

Hi, we are so, so excited
about this.

There has been a change.

They're not coming.

It's too far to walk
in heels.

See? She might as well
have been my real mom

'cause she just chose a heel
over me.

Hi, here I am to meet kiki,
my bff.

And look at my new dress!
Twinsies!

They certainly are.

Sorry, she's not coming.

We had to film them
in jamba juice instead.

Oh.

Well, this is super awkward.

[Clanking cookware]

Stupid Kardashians!

Kim, kankels, krank,

and the little ones,
kegel and kickball,

you can kiss my keister.

Max, stop it!
I'm trying to sleep.

Well, sorry, but I'm pissed
and it's 11:30 anyway.

What's going on?

Even one tweet from Kim
would have exposed us

to 22 million followers.

Scientology doesn't even
have those numbers.

They screwed us.
- I know.

That is why I'm making
hate cupcakes

for the Kardashians, see?

"Eat it,"
"bite me,"

and these three...
"Get" "a" "job."

Oh, and one for the mom
that says, "I still love you,"

just in case.

Now come on, get up.

Your son needs to go out
and take an 8-foot crap.

No, I'm done.

If everyone's done
with cupcakes, so am I.

I'm done pretending that
everything's gonna work out.

In our reality show,
it's not.

Look, get up, or I will close
this bed with you in it,

and your new reality show will
be true life: I live in a wall.

I'm not getting up.
Ever.

Aah! Max, stop, stop it!
Stop it!

Put me down!
Put me down!

What's happening?

I can't lift my head.

Did I have a stroke?

Calm down.
No one has stroked in your bed

since--what is it,
going on a year?

Max.
My hair is caught.

My hair is caught!
My hair is caught!

Who are you yelling at?

The whole situation!
Do something!

Let me look.

Oh yeah, it's all caught up
in the bed gears here.

Oh my god, I have a bed
with gears

and my hair is caught in it!

Ooh, nope.

It's really all stuck up
in there.

It's so odd.

I don't know how a thing like
this could happen.

Uh, you put me up into the wall.

And now I'm trapped
in a Murphy bed

like some welfare rapunzel.

Stop panicking,
I'll get a scissors.

Oh, yeah, yeah!
Get the scissors.

Then plunge 'em into my heart
'cause I'd rather die

than cut my hair.

Okay, Max, I think I have
something that might work,

but you have to promise me

that you will never bring
this up again.

What?
The fact that your head

is stuck to your bed?

Sorry, that's coming up again.

Go into my nightstand

and get my cinnamon-flavored
make-up remover.

You mean the lube?

Can we please call it
make-up remover?

Please!
I need us to do that.

It's almost empty.

Man, you've removed
a lot of make-up.

Stop it!
Just squeeze some out

and put it on the parts
that we need to move.

Yeah, I'm familiar.

Ew!

[Whining]

Please tell me it's working.

I'm trying, but I don't think
I can get your hair out.

Good news is, I think we
can fit a penis in there.

[Knock on door]

Who could that be?

A rapist we've done most
of the work for.

Oh, we were just talking
about you.

Max, you gotta help me with
the bread for han's toast.

I've already burned
ten of these.

Turns out the only thing
I can successfully bake is meth.

Oleg, come to the bed.
I need you!

All right!

Only took you four years,
but I'm here, baby.

No, it's not like that, Oleg.

Just get over here!

Okay.

Hold this.

Earl, what are you doing here?

Oleg called me
when he couldn't get Caroline

to stop the screaming.

Hi, Max.
Earl gave me part of a brownie.

Turns out, glaucoma
and having hair stuck

take the exact same
prescription.

Look!

That's right, you mothers!

I did it!

I made the perfect bread!

You're a chef who took 19 hours
to make one loaf of bread.

Stephen Hawking was more
successful at the 100-yard dash.

And you--
you are aware

that I went all the way
into Manhattan,

cupcake-bombed
Kim Kardashian's hotel,

and you're still just
laying here, right?

Didn't you have to pee?

I held most of it in.

This is crazy.
You've been here all day.

Let's just cut
your damn hair already.

I wouldn't be me
without my hair.

I can't live without it.

Yes, you can.

You have lived without money,

you've lived without
electricity,

you've lived without plumbing.

What do you think got me
through it?

My hair.

I'd be like, "lost all my money,
the toilet's clogged,

still got my hair."

[Knock at door]

Darling, I don't think
those brownies are kicking in.

I also have some lollipops.

I hope you're happy.

I didn't see anything through
the peep-hole,

so I'm guessing it's han.

Ah, hello!

I have an open diner
and no diner staff!

Han, look, I made perfect bread.

Oh, wow.
It's bigger than I'm used to.

Let me just take a minute
and breathe.

And I'm sure
I can take it all in.

Well, if you need any help,

Caroline's got
some make-up remover.

Kiki tweet, kiki tweet,
kiki tweet!

She's saying "kiki tweet"!

How did he understand that?
Is he part dolphin?

Kim Kardashian tweeted
a pic of my mean cupcakes

and said, "Max's homemade
cupcakes #notcool."

Oh, my god, Kim Kardashian
hates someone I know!

That went out to
22 million people!

I'm so sorry.
Why?

Do you know how many people
can't stand the Kardashians?

Our cupcake window
will be packed!

Cut me loose.

Hey, Caroline,
we're finally about to scissor.

Are you sure?

We got a business to run.

Cut it, I'll be fine.

Aah!

Yeah, you're gonna need
that lollipop.

Yeah, I know,
those Kardashians are the worst.

That's why I don't keep up
with them anymore.

All right, Max.
Okay, that's it.

Just one left.
Not bad.

And your hair's not bad either.

Yeah, now,

after the emergency trip
to that salon.

When you got done with me,

I looked like
a baby bird on chemo.

I'm sorry I had to use the last
of our savings for my hair cut.

No, you're not.
- No, I am not,
I love this.

Hi, I'm Kim.

[Both exhaling heavily]

I just wanted to say sorry

that we didn't film here
the other day.

It almost hurts to look at her.

I know how hard
us girls really work

to keep our businesses going,

so I'll take a cupcake

and I'll totally tweet
about it for real.

[Squeaks]
Thank you so much.

Here, here, here, here, here.

We can't break a $100,
and anyway,

this is so on the house.

Oh, thanks.

Cute hair.

Wait.
Real quick...

Do you think your mother
would adopt me?

This is super awkward.

[Squealing quietly]

[Both shrieking and laughing]

Here's your check, Mr. ZZ
and Mr. Top.

Would you like a to-go box,

or are you just gonna put it
in your beard

with the rest of your sandwich?

We're in a beard-growing
contest.

They happen all over
the country.

It's a pretty big deal.

What's first prize?

Blindfold for your girlfriends?

I'm kidding, I know you don't
have girlfriends.

Actually, this level
of hair-art

takes months of hard work
and commitment.

Well, quack, quack,
Duck Dynasty.

My left armpit
could beat you both.

Let me tell you something
on behalf of women everywhere.

We. Don't. Like. Beards.

Caroline?
Beards?

(Caroline)
I never liked being one.

Ladies, if his name is Trace,
get the hell out of there.

See?
So, shave losers.

If you're chinless
or chin-plentiful,

it's better than
what you've got going on.

There's your tip,
be generous with mine.

You actually insult people
and then expect them

to give you money?

That's how it works
with you and me.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

Thanks.

Everyone's loving our new
cupcake T-shirts.

I've sold four in the last hour.

Three more and we can afford
that towel we've had our eye on.

These T-shirts keep selling.

That means more money.

Mo' means mo' success.

Mo' Success?

I think I dated
his cousin, Les.

Hey, everybody.

Mind if I stop
for a breather?

I've been "briding"
my ass off.

Sophie, are those all your
bridal magazines?

That's only half.

Come on, Oleg!

Look, if those are too heavy,
how are you going to be able

to push the wedding donkey
down the aisle?

Wedding donkey?

My excitement level for this
wedding just skyrocketed.

Relax, Sophie.

If I know how to do anything,
it's how to move an ass.

That's true.
Yeah.

Wow, you're carrying more heavy
issues than Amanda Bynes.

Look at all these.
Beautiful Bride,

Modern Bride, City Bride?

And do you really need
African American Bride?

Well, I haven't ruled out
cornrows.

Cornrows and a donkey?

RSVP yes.

Oh, yeah.

This one's hot.

Save that one for later.

Oh, I forgot I'm getting
married.

Keep her.

I might need a Tuesday off.

Sophie, why don't you get some
help from your Maid of Honor?

I will kill you.

Or a wedding planner?

Oh, Sophie, my cousin, Svetlana,
is a wedding planner.

Okay, but she better be good.

Because I want everything
to be perfect on my big day.

Our big day.

Yeah. Sure.

I can't believe this.

They're getting married and
I don't have a wedding donkey

anywhere on my horizon.

OMG, you sell these T-shirts?

I just bought one.

Did I jut sell you that shirt
and already forgot?

I knew that nine-cent deodorant

was going to give me
brain lesions.

Well, the label did have
a picture of a brain

with "No Bueno" written on it.

No, I bought it at a store
in Manhattan

on East Ninth and Broadway.

I know because I'm OCD
and it was 67 steps

and 14 sidewalk cracks
from the corner.

Max, someone else is selling
our shirts.

I know.

We're getting hosed
by some other hoes.

I can't believe they stole
our shirt.

The one thing we made that
people actually wanted to buy.

I feel like Myspace.

I haven't seen anything
this upsetting in a window

since that time I accidentally
caught a reflection

of myself in my
waitress uniform.

We need to talk to someone

about those damn shirts
you jacked.

We about to rumble.

What she means is,
we wish to speak to someone

about the adorable
cupcake T-shirts in the window.

Or, we will be about to rumble.

I'm just working here
till I get my PhD

in the Eco-Social Dynamics
of Western Civilization.

So, forever?

Those T-shirts are our design

and we need to know why
they're here

and who knocked them off.

It's the granddaughter
of the woman who owns this shop.

She's kind of a monster
and she's walking in right now.

Hi, Kemberly and Ashlin.

These ladies are interested
in your T-shirts.

Aren't they cute?

So cute.

Yeah, super cute.

We designed them.

Yeah, we designed them.

What?

Yeah, what?

Ashlin and Kimberly, is it?

It's Kemberly, with an "E."

I changed it myself
'cause I'm original.

Yeah, she's an original.

You know what's not original?

Those shirts.
You stole them from us.

We did not steal your idea.

Yeah, we did not steal
your idea.

We copied it from this lame
cupcake shop in Brooklyn.

Wait a minute...

we have a lame cupcake shop
in Brooklyn.

Ashlin, you talk too much.

This is why everyone knows
about my lap-band.

I think they know about it
because you lost 200 pounds

over Spring break.

It's hard to believe she was
once twice this obnoxious.

If you don't stop selling
our T-shirts,

we're gonna have to get
our lawyer involved.

Yeah, we're gonna have to get
our lawyer involved.

And he's gonna kill you.

I don't know
what lawyers do.

We're totally not
doing this for us.

We're rich.

Yeah, we're rich.

A percentage of every shirt
that we sell goes to charity.

Yeah, it goes to charity.

We are the charity
that it needs to go to.

You're old and desperate
for money.

And I totally get it.

My aunt's one of the
Real Housewives of New York.

But, sorry.

It's the one without
the leg.

What just happened here?

That girl just called you old.

Earl, I don't think I'm going
to be buying you that pinky ring

you wanted any time soon.

No rush Max,
you got plenty of time.

I got like, six or seven months
before I turn to dust.

It's 'cause our T-shirts
got ripped off

by a couple of prep school
girls in Manhattan.

It's like a bad 80's movie.

I don't know whether to
date James Spader

or teach this town how to dance.

This is so unfair.

Those girls can't just steal
from us.

This isn't 7-Eleven.

Max, I can't believe
your naiveté.

What does my body spray
have to do with anything?

Look, there is no reason
to be so upset

about those two girls.

They're not going
to affect our business.

Plus, they have to live
with themselves.

And karma is a bitch.

I mean, I littered once
and look what happened to me.

Hey, everybody.

I'm up to my nuts
in bridal junk.

[bell dings]

There she is.

The love of my life.

The yin to my yang.

The zing to my wang.

Save that gold for the vows.

I am Svetlana, Oleg's cousin.

Well, darling,
it could be worse.

You could be his sister.

Svetty!

And you must be Sophie.

Yeah.

No.

But you haven't even heard
any ideas.

Caroline.

Sophie, why did you
just say my name?

Oh, it's Oleg's
and my safe word.

Yeah.
It means no.

It's the one word we both agreed
we would never say during sex.

Are you sure?

Because I give free oil change
with every wedding.

Caroline.

All right, well,
I'll be in my booth.

You know, this wedding planner
thing is as crappy as the movie

of the same name.

Girls, I forgot to tell you,

a man came by today
with this letter for you.

This reminds me of when
I was a young, hot-shot courier.

I was a young, hot-shot courier
once, too.

I used to deliver drugs to my
mother at work on my tricycle.

Oh, my God, Max,
you're not gonna believe this,

but those two girls have issued
a Cease and Desist order.

Those bitches.

What's that?

They're saying we have to stop
selling our T-shirts.

That's what I told them
we were going to do.

They even copied this idea.

We need to get a lawyer.

How? We can't even afford
Law & Order on iTunes.

Hey, do you think we could
afford that lawyer

on the subway billboards?

The one who has a gavel in one
hand and a chicken in the other?

I think he just
does acidentes.

What is going on here?

There's food waiting
in the window,

periodicals strewn about.

Someone's on his periodical.

Han, we just got served.

At least someone
in the diner has.

You're lucky your boss
is so chill.

Of course you're chill, you're
one of Mr. Popper's penguins.

How about this?

We'll do the jobs
you already pay us for

if you agree to pretend
to be our lawyer.

You have a suit, right?

Why would I pretend
to be a lawyer?

You can't even pretend
to be waitresses.

No one's gonna believe
Han's our lawyer, anyway.

He can't pass the bar,
he can barely see over one.

That's it! I've had it with you
two and your non-work ethic.

And this area is for customers.

I want these out of here!

(Max)
Ow!

Uh-oh.

Max?

I suppose I could dig up a suit
if that could, somehow,

make this boss striking
his employee thing go away.

Max, of course these girls
go to Dalby Hall,

all my archenemies did.

I guess Lady Gaga won
in the end, though.

In other news,
I kind of like this eye-patch.

I know you do,
you were pretending to be

the pirate queen
of the subway.

Well, no one arrrrrgued with us.

How long did the eye doctor
say you have to keep it on?

And by eye doctor, I mean
that first-year med student

we gave the free dessert to.

A few days, which is a bummer,
'cause only seeing half

of how sad we are
is kind of a blessing.

How are we gonna find them?

Follow the scent of our decaying
T-shirts business?

According to Instagram,
they're in the cafeteria, see?

Ashlin just posted a pic
of a mini-pizza.

#thatpizzalife

They have mini-pizzas
here?

My high school
didn't even have heat.

Sorry I'm late.
I had to pick up a suit

at the Men's Warehouse.

Don't you mean
the Not Quite A Man's Warehouse?

Han, I love your lawyer costume.
So authentic.

Only thing missing is the hole
where your soul should be.

Well, as I always say, if you're
going to do something--

Do it with your left hand so it
will feel like someone else?

No, if you're going to do
something, do it right.

Last Halloween, I went as Sprout
from the Green Giant commercial

and I even put pea pods
over my pee-pee.

You laugh, but I won $500.

Okay, I created my own
Cease and Desist order.

Where did you get this?

Same place Max printed
out that fake,

"I don't have herpes"
doctor certificate.

It works.

And here's your business card.

Where?
Where is it?

I can't see.

Here. And Han, I hope
you're a better actor than Max.

Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
is a better actor than Max.

Mr. Lu Su?

That's what you came up with?

Mr. Lu Su?

Well, you're a lawyer, so the
"Su" part is totally on point.

But Lu Su?

No Asian was ever named that.

Maybe not in this galaxy,

but might I remind you
of a Mr. Sulu.

Oh, yeah. I mixed it up.
Genius!

Han, you don't have to
use the cards.

I can make it work.

Two Halloweens ago,
I was an Ewok

and turned an orange bath-towel
into a turban.

Second place. $250.

And next Halloween,
you can wear that

and goes as a lesbian minister.

Okay, so the plan is,
we go in there

and calmly confront them
with our attorney.

I'll do the talking.

Han, you stand there
and try to look smart.

Ah. I'm already Asian.
So, done.

[indistinct chatter]

Wow, this brings me back.

I had a seat at the popular
table, the Debate Team table,

the Student Council table,

and the Waiting For Marriage
table.

But that table
kind of fell apart

when everybody
got pregnant but me.

I ate in the school
parking lot with a wino.

He was so nice to me,
I thought he might be my dad.

But then he never made
a move on me,

so I guess he wasn't.

(Kemberly)
Attention everyone, attention.

Yeah, attention everyone,
attention.

Ashlin and I are here today
to sell our T-shirts

and to talk about bullying
and how it's not cool.

It's so not cool.

I was talking, Ash.

Yeah, she was talking.

Their charity is bullying?

That's like Kanye West trying
to raise money for laying low.

A $3 donation will be made
to our anti-bullying fund

with each purchase of one
of our super, super cute tees.

Super, super cute tees.

My super cute tee!

Best idea I ever had.

Right up there with the bong
with a chin strap

so you could be hands-free
to change the channel.

So buy a shirt right now
and then we'll be back later

for the rest of the anti-bully
talk.

Yeah, buy them
or my dad won't pay

for the lacrosse
equipment this year.

Let's go.
They are making a fortune on us.

And if I'm gonna get screwed,
it better be by someone over 21

Yeah, that sounds like a job
with a two drink minimum.

Han, don't mess this up or
you'll be eating those glasses.

Might I interest you
in an anti-bullying pamphlet?

Might I interest you in a seat
on my finger?

Hey, how did you two
get in here?

The school pays guards out front
to keep out the homeless.

Yeah, well, jokes on you.

'Cause they just let us walk in.

Hello, girls.
You can "Cease and Desist"

selling our T-shirts as of now.

This is
our attorney, Mr....

Lu Su.

And he is holding our
Cease and Desist

to counter your
Cease and Desist.

Okay, well, first,
your lawyer looks like a teacher

on a Disney show.

Is that a bad thing?

And if you have anything
further to say,

you can take it up
with my lawyer. Her dad.

And he's real good.

He got that CEO guy who admitted
he killed his whole family

out on a technicality.

I forgot how mean girls can be.

How? I'm your roommate.

Thank you, Kemberly.
Thank you, Ashlin.

A little help.

Hello, girls,
you all look very nice.

What is he doing?

Hopefully a tight ten and then
he'll bring up the headliner.

This may be hard to believe,
looking at me

in this totally awesome suit,

but I know a little something
about being bullied.

As a little child--

And as a slightly bigger adult.

Seriously? In the middle of his
bullying speech, your bullying?

Kind of surprised even myself.

I have someone who bullies me.

Okay, let's get out
of here while I can.

It's not just the hitting
and the name-calling.

Although, not gonna lie,
that's a real bummer.

You see, girls, the bad thing
about being bullied

is that every time it happens,
it steals a little piece

of who you are.

And then, if it happens enough,
little by little,

you become just a little less
of who you were meant to be.

And that's not cool.

And these two girls up here,
without knowing it, I'm sure,

stole a little piece
of Max and Caroline.

when they stole
their little idea.

And that's so not cool.

Yeah, that's so not cool.

Max, Caroline,
we'll stop making the shirts.

Ash, I never said that.

Ah, no, Kemberly.
I did.

And I liked you more
before the lap-band.

When you were still Kimberly
with an "I."

[gasping]

[cheering]

Max, did Han just save us?

I wasn't listening,
I was putting mini-pizzas

in my pocket.

Girls, your shift started
40 minutes ago.

What are you doing here
so early?

Earl, good news.
We are now the sole owners

of all those cupcake T-shirts.

And, literally, nothing else.

Maybe I could rent a parrot
and pick up some shifts

at Long John Silver's.

Hey, girls.

I'm about to meet
another wedding planner.

And this one's gonna be good!

He's gay.

Sophie Kuchenski?

Yes, God!

From the second I walked
in here, I said to myself,

"That has to be her."
And I can see it.

We're going to make
magic together.

Yeah, what's gay for no?

Okay.

Wow, I think we just survived
a "torgaydo."

Where am I gonna find another
gay wedding planner

in New York now?

Just throw a tantrum
in a Crate & Barrel,

and five of them
will come running.

Hey, nice legal work today.

You should be on the
Little People's Court.

Yeah, from now on,
I'm calling you "Hanny Cochran."

Okay.
Next time you want to thank me,

just send me
an Edible Arrangement.

I don't know many times
I have to drop that hint.

But that's just, like,
a two-inch drop.

Sorry.
I can't help myself.

But I'm going to try because
I know I was the bully

you were talking about
in that speech.

What? I was talking about
the doorwoman in my building.

I have to submit
to a purple-nurple

just to get my mail.

There's another woman?

Max, I think Han
has a side bully.

Well, I'll just have
to try harder.

Because if anyone is gonna
mercilessly nurple you

into an early grave,
it's got to be me.

I'd like to think so, Max.

You'd also like to ride
in a car facing forwards.

Back to normal.

Earl, I told you to mop the entrance.

That floor is dirtier than Bob Saget

at a Comedy Central roast.

You know what it sounds
like you need, cranky lady?

A Midol and a Dove bar.

You watch it, too, Oleg.

Like Earl's hip, you can be replaced.

Have you noticed since Max
and Caroline have been away,

Han is getting a little
big for his bitches?

Did I say bitches?

'Cause I meant to.

I will not be bossed around by someone

40 years younger than me.

He is not my second wife.

I am calling diner security.

What's up, Earl?

I mean, besides your blood pressure.

When are you coming back?

We're coming back tomorrow night.

Caroline's about to
sign the movie contract,

which means I don't have
to come home UPS Ground.

Are you on the phone with the diner?

I feel like I can smell it.

I don't think any of us

are gonna make it past tomorrow.

Han's been walking around
like he owns the place.

I do own the place!


Boy, Uber drivers do
not like to be tickled.

And speaking of things
no one would see coming,

I used the F-word with Randy.

Who wouldn't see that coming?

You use the F-word all the time...

usually around children or clergy.

No, the F-word as in "future."

Max, you made plans for the future?

You won't even make
dinner plans with me.

You always say, "Who knows if
we'll still be friends by then?"

Well, you always ask me,
like, five hours ahead of time.

Max, I'm gonna go ahead
and use the C-word.

I'm calling you and Randy a couple.

I'm gonna say something,

and I don't want it to go to your head.

You're right, bitch.

See, Max, it all worked out,

right up until what I'm
about to say right now.

We have to take the shuttle
to the airport tomorrow,

'cause we're still poor for
another 27 business days.

Let's go out in style
and get a party bus.

After all these years, we still have

such different concepts of style.

Come on!

With a stripper pole

and a Crock-Pot of cocktail weenies.

I danced on a party bus for a year,

not for money.

We are not taking a party bus.

This isn't your super sweet 16.

I didn't have a sweet 16.

I was in plumbing school.

Hey, everybody.

I don't know what's going on,

but people on the elevator
were looking at me funny.

Sophie!

What?

Do I have spinach in my teeth?

Uh, no spinach, but about 25
needles stuck in your face.

Yeah, they're helping me get pregnant.

My healer Audra sent me to Mao,

the acupuncturist to the stars.

Yep, he's poked more famous
people than John Mayer.

Sophie, you're not supposed
to leave with those needles,

just like we're not supposed
to leave with these vases.

Tell you what, I'm gonna
do what I used to do

for my Aunt Becky at the Elks Lodge.

I'm gonna get some
pricks out of your face.

Max, do you think Randy
invited me to dinner

to witness him asking
you to be bi-coastal?

'Cause I don't think
this mascara's waterproof,

and I'm definitely gonna cry

happy and a few jealous tears.

I'm never been bi-coastal.

I was bisexual for a week,

but that's mostly
because I was hitchhiking.

There they are.

Oh, this is the table
where we first met,

and you thought I was a cheap hooker.

And you were only half right.

Here they come, more
jealous than I expected.

Let's celebrate.

It's a big night for both of you.

Caroline, your movie deal closed,

and Max, I found your sock.

It was under my refrigerator.

Oh, that makes sense.

I was trying to fish an
M&M out from under there

with a fishing hook I made
with a fork and my sock.

I was so excited about getting the M&M

that I abandoned the sock.

Max, you know you
don't have to eat candy

that fell on the floor anymore.

I still will, but it's nice
to know I don't have to.

Oh, my God, your whole life is changing.

We're just waiting for someone else.

Oh, no, did you invite a guy for me?

I wish I'd known,

'cause I only shaved up
to the bottom of my dress.

It's not a date for you.

It's someone here for me and Max.

Wow, I don't usually bring up threesomes

till the one-month mark when
things start to go stale.

Oh, definitely wasn't
picturing this guy.

Hello, I'm Elliot Charles.

Okay, two first names,
slightly more interesting.

So doing the orgy math
here, there's four of us,

and out of the four, Max
and I can't touch naked.

Her rule, not mine.

Oh, I'm not here in a sexual capacity.

I'm Randy's therapist.

And I guess we should get started.

I do have a 9:00 in the valley.

A 13-year-old girl is coming
out to her vegan parents

as meat-curious.

Um, what's happening?

Look, Max... Elliot?

Look, Max, my patient, Randy,

is breaking up with you.

What?

Max, I know this sounds abrupt.

Elliot?

Max, in my practice, I developed

the ripping-the-Band-Aid-off technique.

You'll read about it in my book someday,

if I ever finish it,

but that's between me and my therapist.

He's not speaking to me right now

because of a couch spill.

And I'd be mad as hell about it

if I didn't completely understand it!

And now, again, what's happening?

Because it seems like
you're breaking up with me

using a therapist.

It does seem that way.

Elliot?

He is breaking up with
you using a therapist.

Look, Randy?

Caroline.

Look, Elliot, you tell
Randy to be a grown-up

and break up with her over text.

At least send her a
"Bye, Felicia" bitmoji.

- Let's go.
- Max, don't go like this.

Elliot, don't let Max go like this.

Max, you're hurt.

You're feeling abandoned.

What would be really
helpful to you right now

is my book, if I can just
get one chapter on paper.

I think people would
benefit a lot from the book.

Well, we're leaving.

This is shocking,

and it's really hard to shock me

since that time I saw a mouse

dry-humping a potato on my couch.

You know what?

You can keep my sock.

On second thought, I need it.

Max, wait.

I am just gonna go,
because the last time

I was this mad, someone lost an eyebrow.

And it took me a long time

to grow it back.

Thank you.

Max, hurry!

We have to leave now to
take Sophie to the healer

and still be at the airport by noon.

I brushed your hair
when you were passed out.

I can't move any faster.

I think this escalator's broken.

I tried to stop you from
drinking bottle number 32,

which was sriracha.

But you tied me to that chair so well.

Well, since drinking that hot sauce,

I've been tied to a different chair.

I have something to
make you feel better.

I doubt it.

Unless it's a diaper full of ice.

It's not that. I'll meet you outside.

Okay, okay, remember that party bus

I never wanted and you
probably don't want now?

- Surprise!
- Good timing.

I'm feeling suicidal,
and I've always wanted

to be buried in something like this.

Aw, come on, Max, cheer up.

You're getting two poles
for the price of one.

This is the first time a party bus

hasn't fixed every problem I have.

Well, you haven't seen

my "Stars and Stripes Forever" routine.

Um, Bert, is this rum

supposed to have a cigarette butt in it?

If you gonna puke,
please aim for the floor.

I can hose it down.

Otherwise, I'm finding corn
in the pleather for months.

Well, if I throw up today,
it's not 'cause I'm having fun.

I'm just happy because, finally,

there's ladies in the bus
not wearing penis helmets.

Nope, they were all out of penises,

so I had to settle for balls.

Here, girls.

Nope, I will day drink on a bus,

but I will not put balls on my head.

And you wonder why you're single.

Ugh, there's that crazy
expensive sushi place

where Randy and I ate.

And there's the taco place
we had to eat at afterwards

'cause we were still hungry.

Max, please, you have
to put Randy behind you.

And there's the parking spot
where I put Randy behind me.

Bert, did we sign up for the Hollywood

relationship death tour?

If so, I'd like to hit
the Affleck-Garner house.

And right up there is where he lives.

We'd make a right at that
super ripped homeless guy,

and in two or three blocks,
we'd be at Randy's house.

Oh, no, "we do this," and "we do that."

She's "we"-ing.

As long as nobody wees on the seats,

we'll be fine.

Bert, turn off there, up that street.

No, wait, what are you doing?

You're getting closure.

I want him to face you
without that lame therapist.

Just you and him face-to-testicle.

Ladies, just how stalker-y
are we getting here?

Like a drive around the cul-de-sac?

Or a full-on Demi Moore outside
of Mila Kunis' yoga class?

Ooh, there it is.

Up there on the left.

Yep, there it is.

And there he is letting the dog out.

Oh, and he's only wearing a towel.

Ah, yeah.

Now I get it, Max.

Bert, go. This was a bad idea.

No, this is a great idea.

I am not letting you
take this bad feeling

back to New York.

Bert, open the door. I'm going out.

Bert, close the door. Let's roll.

I, uh, wanted to put some clothes on,

but Caroline wouldn't let me.

Oh, that's the smartest
thing Caroline's done

since I've met her.

Max.

I'm not here.

Max, I can see your
balls behind that pillow.

I can see your balls behind that...

Sophie! Come on.

This is sad.

Oh, well not from where I'm sitting.

Max, I'm sorry about
the way I handled things.

I just don't know how
to break things off.

It's why I was the lawyer

on the last three Adam Sandler movies.

Why?

I just need to know why.

Because I'm too young? I'm too old?

Is there someone else?
You're married? You're gay?

With a body like that, gay
is definitely on the table.

You want the truth?

I like you too much.

That's why I didn't break it off sooner.

I didn't want it to end.

That's why you're breaking up with me?

Because you like me too much?

At least have another family in Mexico.

Max, I've done the long-distance thing.

It's just putting off the inevitable.

You have a life there.
I have a life here.

It doesn't work.

Please don't hate me.

Be easier if I could.

Yep, here they come.

Pardon me?

Are we still firing
your housekeeper today?

Oh, nice hat.

Confirms that theory that women in LA

are the ones with balls.

This is it, girls.

This is where my healer
does all her magic.

Yeah, you know, she must
sweat a lot doing it,

'cause it smells like
it looks in here, right?

What do you think's in those jars?

Every fart that's ever
been held in at yoga?

Are you okay, Max?

I guess.

I just wish you told me closure

feels like someone just slammed my nuts

in the trunk of a Pontiac.

Sophie, we have to be at
the airport in an hour.

Yes, but Audra is my last
chance at getting pregnant.

She'll be ready when she's ready.

I mean, look around.

She's a professional.

Have you seen an orange cat?

A little depressed, Sagittarius?

Wait, Garfield lives here?

Audra, this is Max and Caroline.

You know, I rarely say this to a lady,

but... oh, put a baby in me.

Absolutely.

Hmm?

You think... you don't... okay.

Go ahead.

I'm sorry, I'm just conferring
with my spirit guides.

Well, if you all talk at
once, I can't understand you.

Got it.

They're telling me that someone here

just had their heart broken.

It's you.

Oh, my God, Max.

Come closer to me. Come over here.

Oh, gosh, thanks a lot.

You're bogarting my witch.

These spirits don't lie.

Mm-mm.

A little too honest sometimes.

I mean, I didn't ask them
if they like my bangs,

but they sure told me.

It was a whole thing.

You don't need to help me.

I'll get over the Randy thing.

I've been through worse things,

like this right now.

No.

They're insisting that I help you.

Grab me a jar.

That's where we store the pain...

and lentils, once you're healed.

Great.

No guy, but now I have a
middle-aged lesbian lover.

All right, it's out.

I thought I was gonna have
to move to a bigger jar.

You must've really liked this guy.

He was okay.

Well, he's crushed.

He really liked you too.

Never thought a jar
could make me feel better

that wasn't filled with peanut brittle.

Oh, please, spirits, put a baby in me!

All right, here we go.

Quiet, everybody.

Let me just close the door.

Okay.

Oh, wait.

There's still some other unrest here.

Oh, no, that's way too big.

It's something else.

Oh, really?

Oh, you're telling...

Sure, sure.

Okay. Hold on.

I can't put a baby in you.

Sorry, Sophie.

You can't?

You made me put needles in my eyes.

Put me on with them.

Hey, I'm on your side.

Her bangs are ridiculous.

Hey, Earl, we're back.

Hi, girls.

Let me be the first to say welcome back,

and also, my deepest sympathies.

How are you, Max?

I just flew in from LA,

and boy, are my arms tired

from hitting the person next to me.

They would not stop fidgeting.

I had to pee, and you
wouldn't let me out.

Max, Caroline, you're back!

I mean... hello, how are you?

Han, did you miss us?

Oh, please, I miss you like
America misses Radio Shack.

Surprisingly, it left a hole.

I saw you leave a hole once...

on Groundhog Day.

Max, Caroline, where's Sophie?

I missed her so much.

You know what they say:

absence makes me have to
masturbate almost constantly.

So what did the healer say?

We'll let her tell you.

Hey, everybody!

I'm back from California.

I hope I didn't, like,

totally pick up an accent, dude.

Oh, I was worried Jeremy Renner

would make you the last
thing he'd ever be in.

And I was worried you'd say
something exactly like that.

Well, I'll be in my booth.

So what did the healer say?

How soon can we get a baby in you?

Oh, well, the truth is, Oleg,

the healer said that
she wouldn't be able

to help me get pregnant.

Oh, Sophie. Why not?

Well, the reason

that I can't get pregnant is...

I'm already pregnant!

Yeah!

I'm gonna be a father?

Yes, I'm three months along.

Yeah, no, that's the last time

I'll buy a pregnancy test off a boat.

Well, let's bust out the very cheap,

non-alcoholic champagne.

Non-alcoholic?

Yeah, Sophie can't drink
when she's pregnant.

Oh, all right.

Well, then, the five martinis

that I had on the plane were my last.

Max, we're back.

Aw, that sucks.

This place didn't burn down
while we were gone,

like I had hoped.

The night is young, and I have
a Roman candle in my pocket.

Hi, welcome to
the Williamsburg diner.

Table for two?

Don't be silly, Earl.

It's us, Max and Caroline.

And I'm Earl.
Smoking or nonsmoking?

Glad to have you back.

Max and Caroline!

You're back from your road trip.

And right on time
for yesterday's shift.

We're also not working today.

she's not my type.

What is your type?

Hepatitis A, B, or C?

So what did you bring us?

Uh, you guys don't understand.

We got kicked off a riverboat,

almost crashed a plane,

and lost everything we own.

Honestly, it's a miracle
we're alive.

So...no gifts?

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[cash register bell dings]

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Let's get to the dessert bar

so we can see the work they did.

Also so people don't think

we're customers here.

I'm excited to see it too,

and now that Randy and I
are really over,

I promise to give
the dessert bar my full 5%.

Make it 6%.

I mean, what else
am I gonna do, hmm?

Stop.

Oleg, stop blocking the door.

We're not on a date with you.

We want to see the dessert bar.

Eh, sure,

but before you go in there,

do you want to see
a cute picture

of me, Sophie, and baby Barbara?

Sure.

(both yelling)

You didn't say it was
in the bathtub.

Well, now that you're annoyed

and hopefully
a little impressed...

Mm-mm.

I can tell you

I had to fire your contractor.

BOTH: What?

I thought I could do
a better job.

BOTH: What?
-I couldn't.

I can't believe Oleg!

How the hell could he let
a complete stranger...

(both gasp)

Do such an amazing job?

Wow.

Wait, we're still killing Oleg,
though, right?

'Cause the wheels are already
in motion.

Oh, my God, look at the doors.

(gasps)
And the molding?

Wow, Barbara got so big
while we were gone.

Oh, shh!

You got to give her a break,
'cause she got

her Uncle Fatso's genes.

By the way, Sophie, thank you
for watching our horse

while we were gone.

He's my favorite roommate.

Aww, well, you know what,

that's what friends are for.

And I'm sure you would
do the same for me

if I needed a favor.

-Of course we would.
-Good, 'cause I need a favor.

Yeah, see,

I joined this mommy
support group, you know,

to make sure that I'm holding
the baby up right,

or you know,

that I don't get too jealous

when people compliment her.

The standard mom stuff.

So what's the favor?

I'll do anything up to
a Class B felony.

I still have one strike left.

Well, I'm hosting,

and there are gonna be a lot
of sloppy babies there,

so I'm looking for a real dump.

Can I use your place?

-Aww.
-Sophie, I don't think--

(laughs)
Thank you, girls.

Yeah, you're the best,

no matter what baby Barbara
tells her friends.

I thought Barbara liked me.

I'm gonna text her.

Oh, hey.
I'm Bobby.

I did the work on your bar.

You must be Max and Caroline.

I'm Maroline, and this is Cax.

(stammering)

-I mean--
-Yeah, let's just move past it.

Uh, we're who you said.

Well, I hope you like it.

The only guidance I got

was from your friend Oleg,

who just kept saying "sluttier."

And then he showed me
a picture of him in the bathtub.

You did an amazing job.

I mean, what you did
with those knobs.

Polished brass.

Looks like you want to
polish his brass.

And how do you like the satin
on the sconces?

(gasps)
Oh, my God.

My knees are wiggling.

You like that?

-And the finish on the molding?
-Oh, love it!

I think she's about to finish
on the molding.

You're the only man
who knew what I wanted

without me having to tell him
three times

and then give up.

Hey, great.

I'll tell the boss you liked it.

"Bobby, you did it again."

In case you missed it,
I'm the boss.

(laughing)

See, 'cause he's the boss,

so he was telling himself.

It's too many levels for her.

Hey, um, listen,
I should probably get going,

but if you need anything else,

you can call me.

Or my boss.
Anytime.

Well, I might just have to
call you both.

Ciao!

"Ciao"?

Unless you're gonna say "mein"
after that,

I don't know what
you're talking about.

He's really cute.

Oh, you think so?

You were playing it pretty cool,
Maroline.

(laughs)

(all laughing)

Ooh, oops.

Oh, don't worry,

you can ruin everything in here.

I don't care.

(laughing)

I do.

I just scrubbed the couch.

How much longer
do we have to stay in here?

Caroline's talking about
a third grade field trip.

I got lost in Toronto.

Girls, ignore them.

Society does.

Yeah.

Uh, so where are your babies?

Out parking the car?

(laughs)

See, I don't let Barbara
drive yet.

Should I?

We don't bring 'em
to the meetings.

They ruin everything.

Starting with our vaginas.

Oh, yeah,

my husband ruined mine

on my first date.

(laughing)

See--well, see, I thought

that a mother's group,
you know, you--

you talk about your babies.

Wouldn't they love that?

No, this is for us to--

to trade pills and get trashed

and fantasize about
 Gone Girl-ing our husbands.

Oh, my God,
I'm doing everything wrong.

Yeah, just like the '84 Olympics
all over again.

(knocking at door)

What's up, sluts?

Ugh, there's a baby here?

If I weren't already stoned,

Should I?

Seeing what you girls did
to the dessert bar

inspired me to make
some improvements around here.

Don't tell me you found a way

to unstick the menus
from the tables.

Whoa, one step at a time.

I did give this place
more of a facelift

than Brad Pitt in preparation
for the movie Allied.

Yeah, Han, this place
looks exactly the same.

My suicide note is still
scrawled on the wall.

Yeah, it looks like the same old
post office to me.

It's not a freakin' post office!

Max, we should really
get over to the dessert bar.

Bobby's on his way to look
at those gorgeous sconces

I am very unhappy with.

Why do you have to use
the dessert bar

as an excuse to see him?

If you like him,
why don't you just say,

"Hey, you're cute.
Want to see my horse?"

Because a lady
waits for a gentleman

to ask to see her horse.

I don't know what ladies
you're hanging out with.

Apparently none.

(phone chimes)
Ooh!

Bobby's at the dessert bar.

Let me just change
into something

a little more comfortable.

Why are you making this
so complicated?

Why don't you just say,
"Let's get drinks

to make the sex less awkward?"

Or you could do that.

Oh, hi, Bobby, I forgot
you were stopping by.

She thought she was hosting
 Wheel of Fortune in here.

I'd buy a vowel from her.

Well, it would be two As.

Uh...

oh, uh, what did you want
to show me?

Apparently a little side boob.

This sconce.

I noticed that if I put

all the force of my body
against it,

it moves a little.

See?

(grunting)

Ugh, I--

I must have jammed it into place

while I was testing
its virility.

I mean, stability.

Ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

See?
Told you it was loose.

I guess I have stick around
as long as it takes

until it's fixed.

Oh, good, because
I wouldn't feel safe

pulling aggressively
on anything until you do.

Caroline!

We got to get to the hospital.

Oh, no, I'm fine.

Bobby caught me.

Not for you, Vanna Very White.

I just got a call saying Randy
was in an accident in Manhattan.

He must have been coming
to see me.

Just when I thought it was over,

he ropes me back in with
a life-threatening emergency.

How bad is he?

Because these sconces

won't be able to wear this dress
again tomorrow.

All I know is that it's serious,
and they called me

'cause I'm the emergency contact
on his phone.

Okay. I'll be back
as fast as I can.

I'll work as slow as I can.

I won't tell your boss...
'cause he's the--

I get it.
Let's go.

Oh, he's still alive.

Oh, thank God his face
isn't hurt.

And--one, two, three,
four, five, six.

Yep, they're all there.

Why is his shirt always off?

He's like Kirsten Dunst
in a dramatic role.

Well, I had to take
his shirt off, because--

well, 'cause you know,
he broke his leg.

This is a private room.

You ladies can't be in here.

I'm his emergency contact, Max.

I'll take the rest
of his clothing off from here.

And can you get me a straw

so we can share this
morphine drip mai tai style?

You girls have two minutes,

and remember,
this is a hospital,

so no messing around.

Ooh, that's my coconut oil.

Coconut oil?

Great, now he's edible.

Oh, my God, Max.

This is very
 An Affair to Remember.

I'm more of a Quickie to Forget
kind of girl.

No, that Randy came all the way
to New York to see you

and then got into
a tragic accident

and now here you are
at his bedside.

Max, I don't want
to get ahead of myself,

but we might both
have boyfriends.

Double date dance?

Max?

What are you doing here?

Where's my shirt?

When did Caroline start hosting
 Wheel of Fortune?

Ah, that's what I said!

Um, I got the call
that you were hurt,

so I came right over,

and as for your shirt,

I think the nurses

are making a pillow husband
out of it.

Hi, Randy,
sorry you broke your leg,

but great news.

I like someone.

Oh, that's right.

You're still
my emergency contact.

I'm sorry.

I never switched it back
to my trainer.

What happened?
Was it a runaway hot dog cart?

Because that is
my worst nightmare...

besides having my credit card
declined at Kohl's.

But I lived through it.

I got hit by a cab
on my way to JFK.

You mean you got hit by a cab

on your way from JFK.

You were in New York
to see me, right?

Track me down,
beg me to take you back,

pull my hair a little?

No, I was--I was leaving.

Leaving? But you hadn't--

Do you know what?

The accident must have

given him that
"to-and-from-lexia."

I think Whoopi Goldberg has it.

Time's up, ladies.
Patient needs a sponge bath.

He's got coconut oil
all over him.

Hey, Max, wait.

She just got here.
Didn't she?

Told ya. He's got that
"come-and-go-heimers."

Whoopi writes all about it
in her book.

It's very hard to follow.

Max, these are like pajamas

for couples
who don't care anymore.

Speak for yourself.

These puppies care a lot.

Oh, good, they're all gone.

They left me zero room
to sign his cast.

I want to get back
to the dessert bar

while Bobby's still there

and possibly working up
a little sweat.

Go ahead.
I'll punch you out.

But if you keep leaving early,

they're gonna make you
work Christmas.

Nurse, we need
all hands on deck.

We've got a 41 in here,

and he's a squirter.

You--you're up, girl.
I had the last one.

"Dear Randy,
Nice ass.

Nurse Barb."

Well, that is good.

-Max.
-(exclaims)

I didn't wake you, did I?

But now that you're up,
why are you in New York?

You said you were
on your way to the airport

when you got hurt?

I was.

So you weren't here to see me.

No, I was trying not to see you.

Wow.

I'm leaving.

Max.

Ow.

You broke up with me.

That time over the phone?

You took that seriously?
That's insane.

The "This is a cry for
attention" was implied.

What I heard was,
"This isn't enough for me,"

and since we can't make it work,
it just--it's--

it's too hard for me to see you.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I heard what you said

on the movie set.

In Texas?

How'd you hear
what I said on set?

(scoffs)
I was a zombie extra.

Grow up.

That was you.

Everyone said I was crazy
because I thought

I saw you and Caroline on set.

My therapist put me
on antidepressants.

Yeah, well, joke's on them,

'cause it really was me
hanging there.

Max, that's crazy.

Why didn't you say something
when you saw me?

Because you said
you were in a good place

and you want to move on,
blah, blah, blah.

And I don't want
to hurt you anymore.

But now I want to break
your other leg.

Max, look at us.

I ran to the airport
and got hit by a cab

trying to get out of here

because I was tempted
to see you.

And you broke into a hospital
not to steal drugs.

Maybe this relationship
is bad for us.

CAROLINE:
There's just so much squirt!

Definitely for Caroline.

I miss you.

I miss you too.

Then let's stop being crazy.

Move to LA.

You know, six years ago,

I would've done that
in a heartbeat.

I would've thrown
my bubblegum cigs

and my nunchucks
in a Safeway bag

and been your lady.

But it's different now.
I'm different.

I care about something,

and I have people
who count on me.

I've built a life here.

Damn it.

Max, you know I can't leave
my firm in LA.

So what happens now?

I think we kiss good-bye.

Hmm.

You really trust yourself
against the girls?

Not even remotely.

How about a handshake?

There's nothing less sexual.

Okay, but two pumps
and we're out.

I can't not make it sexual.

You smell nice.

I've got a lot of jerky
in my pocket.

Good news is,

I saved a man's life.

Bad news is,

I left a ring inside him.

Here's your flan-tini

and a side of a bottle
of tequila.

Why are you so sad, Caroline?

I mean, she doesn't have kids.

Well, I did like this guy Bobby,

but then I had to go
with Max to see Randy,

and I got squirted on,

and I didn't get back in time
to see him and possibly

missed a chance
at a lifetime of happiness.

Too much talking
from the waitress.

(clears throat)

Uh, ladies,

are all of the daddies

still in the picture?

'Cause I can't shimmy
down a fire escape

like I used to.

That's so funny.

If my doorman drops out
of the rotation,

I'll give you a call.

Uh, let me give you
my beeper number.

Yep!

I'm really having a blast
with my mom friends.

Do you have an aspirin,
or a sledgehammer?

Why do you want to hang out
with these ladies?

They're mean.

One of them tried to trip me.

Yeah, that was me.

Yeah, I--I was trying
to impress them.

Sophie, I wished my mom
cared enough about me

to curl my baby eyelashes

like you do for Barbara.

Or just to intervene

when a neighborhood dog
took me away.

Sophie,

your text wasn't clear.

Should Barbara wear the leopard
onesie with the jean hat

or the jean onesie
with the leopard hat?

Also, I can't find
any of her toe rings.

Sophie, are you secretly caring
for your baby

Should I?

No.

No, 'cause I'm a good mom,

and a good mom
doesn't marry her baby!

At least not in this country.

Let's go, baby.

Well, Meghan's dog walker gave
her some cat tranquilizers.

Why don't we go try those
in the Target parking lot?

Ugh, I can't wait to be a mom

so I can get
the good cat tranqs.

You know they didn't pay, right?

Hey, uh...

sorry to barge in, but I can't
stop thinking about--

Her boo-tay?

Uh, well, that table
is really unsteady.

If my boss knew,

I'd be furious.

I know, right?

I thought it was just me,

but I mean, look at it, I--

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

I mean...

(both grunting)

Rock steady.

Perfect, actually.

Damn it.

You can't think of anything else
that needs to be fixed?

No, and it's really annoying.

You know what else is annoying?

You two not jammin'.

You like each other.
What's the problem?

-So you like me?
-Yeah.

-Okay, so I should call--
-Yes.

Good, 'cause I was this close
to calling my cousins

to come in and tear
this place apart.

-I'm gonna call you.
-Ciao mein.

-What?
-Nothing.

Wow, look at you.

I'm gonna have to
put the brakes on that

40-Year-Old-Virgin sequel.

I'm sorry I'm happy
when you're not happy.

I am happy...

for you.

I know you said you didn't
want to talk about it,

but why don't you just go to LA
to be with Randy?

(scoffs)

I can't go to LA.

I mean, there's too much
stuff here

they don't have there, like...

the Statue of Liberty.

You know she's my girl.

You never want to go.

And she invited us
when she said,

"Bring us your poor."

Plus, where would I find weed
in California?

I mean, the list goes on and on.

I wouldn't leave you either.

Here's your fish of the day.

That day is last Monday.

Excuse me, miss?

There's a hair
in my meatloaf.

This never happens.

Oleg!

We got a H-34 at T-2!

A hair?
That's impossible.

Let me put some pants on.

I am so sorry

that you ordered the meatloaf.

Shouldn't he be
in a hairnet?

He should be in a prison.

Good news.

It's not mine.

That Propecia's
really paying off.

Obviously, it's not mine.
I'm blonde.

You're not blonde everywhere.

I love carpet-and-drapes talk.

I want my money back.

Me too.

Well, it ain't mine.

Last time my hair
was this long,

I was a back-up dancer
on Solid Gold.

Han!

We got a customer
with a hair up his butt

and one in his meatloaf.

Step aside.

Let an expert through.

Look, it's "Law and Order: SAD."

It's brown, somewhere between
coffee and burnt sienna,

cleaned hastily with
a combination shampoo-body wash.

Mm, this hair belongs
to a single white man

alone, and not by choice,
but so set in his ways--

Okay!

It's mine!

Next time you want a free meal,

order the fish of the day.

Am I right, ma'am?

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Hey,
can I order something?

I'm gonna need to
see some ID.

I'm getting the itch
to hit the road again

and I'll need a new identity.

I'll have a Moscow Mule.

Uh, how about
a Jolly Rancher shot?

They're one of our
signature drinks,

served with a side
of my finger-guns.

How about a Moscow Mule

since that's what
I just ordered?

Oh, are you sure?

The shot glasses are made
of actual Jolly Ranchers.

Kids love 'em.

One Moscow Mule coming up.

All righty.

You don't know
how to make one, do you?

No clue.

How 'bout I just
make it myself?

Hmm, while you're at it,
I'll have a Jack and Coke.

Always wanted to know
what was in that.

Max, what's that guy
doing behind you?

Oh...
(scoffs)

You know I never
look when they're back there.

Look, you can't let
people serve themselves.

Again, not everything
is a Hometown Buffet.

Uh, if it were,
I'd be eating a biscuit

with macaroni and pudding
on top.

People aren't ordering
our signature drinks.

They want real ones,
and I only know

how to make the stuff
on the menu.

And Molly lollipops,
which I call "Mollipops."

Then let me do it.

And is that why I slept
for three days after Halloween?

Can I get a greyhound?

Greyhound...

Oh...
(scoffs)

I don't drive for them anymore.

Politics!

Uh, you heard the man.

We're not paying you
to just stand around.

You're not paying me at all.

Not with that attitude.

Believe me, if we could afford
a bartender, we'd hire one.

This obviously isn't working out
for either of us.

Ahem!
(clears throat)

Was there a problem
with your service?

Max, we need to talk about
what happened last night.

Oh, crap, you said
you were on the pill.

We need someone
at the dessert bar

who knows how to
make real drinks.

Not that your
"cigarette butt and tonic"

wasn't a hit.

You said we couldn't
afford a bartender...

or a mechanical bull,

which would have
paid for itself by now.

Here's my idea.

We are going to
bartending school so we can--

and don't kick me--
be the best--

no pinching,
not my nose--

business we can be!

-G'doink.
-Oh.

You didn't say anything
about G'doinks.

What do you think?
'Cause we're already

signed up and
it's non-refundable.

I took your share
out of your piggy bong.

(gasps)

You stole from
Cheech and Change?

(baby crying)

Okay, you can say
you hate the idea,

but you don't have to
cry about it.

Man, this baby's
more full of crap

than a Coldplay album.

Fine, I'll change your diaper,
but when you grow up,

you're going to have to
return the favor.

SOPHIE: The diaper goes
the other way!

Earl, did that doll just talk

or are the voices
telling me to kill again?

No, no, it's been
yelling at me all day.

Between this and
the police chatter

I pick up on my hearing aid,

it's like a damn party
in my head.

Roger that.

Can this doll get any creepier?

SOPHIE: Takes one to know one,
Caroline.

Asked and answered.

Hey.

Can't a lady have
a smoke and a tinkle

without having to
worry about her baby?

You were watching us
from the toilet?

Can't you just hold your nose
and hover like everyone else?

It's my surveillance doll.
Look.

It's hooked up to
an app in my phone.

Look, she's got

cameras in her eyeballs;

she's got a microphone
in her mouth;

and look, a laser pointer
in her butt.

Is that the American Girl Doll
PATRIOT Act edition?

Isn't she cute?

Look, she's like my twin,

only more alive.

Thank you

for keeping your eye
on Barbara.

BOTH: Aww.

Well,
thanks so much.

I'd pay you, but I know you're
too proud to take the money.

Uh, actually, the medical bills
are piling up, Sophie.

-Well, see you later!
-And I could really use...

If you need a free babysitter,
that guy.

Is it just me

or is it hot and blurry in here?

Pardon me, sir.

Oh, my God, Han.

You're covered in spots
and you're delirious.

You have chicken pox.

You also have chicken legs,
so I guess you're even.

Han, you have to go home.

You're contagious.

And not like my laugh.

(laughs)

Welcome to
the Dinersburg Williams.

Who said that?

You did!
You have to go home.

Well, I suppose
I could get into bed

and Hulu a little
 Mindy Project.

And, boy, is she a project.

(giggles)

Han looked pretty unsteady.

Do you think someone should
make sure he gets home okay?

Don't worry so much.
He'll be fine.

See?
Fine.

I know this is just
bartending class,

but gum, please?

That was chewing tobacco, FYI.

We need to take this
seriously, Max.

(gasps)
Is that a pocket knife?

Uh, yeah.

How are they gonna know
I was here

if I can't carve my initials
in the desk?

Maybe we should sit
at separate workstations.

I'm obviously gonna be
the top student here

and I don't want to be
associated with your

"rebel without health insurance"
attitude.

(scoffs)
Fine, smell you later.

Hi.

I haven't been in a class

since I graduated from Wharton.

-It's an Ivy League--
-I went to Harvard.

Wharton was my safety school.

Max, do you still have
that pocket knife?

Okay, I think everyone is here.

Hi,
my name is Gil Bronski

and I am in no rush
to go home.

I live with my mother
and her three cats,

two of whom
have diarrhea.

(laughing)

I thought it was an icebreaker.

No, it's a carpet-ruiner.

(laughs)

Oh, thanks, Julie.

Julie's killing it.

Now, you're probably
all wondering,

"How did this former child actor

"briefly sidelined by
a 30-year drug addiction

find himself teaching
bartending school?"

Just got lucky?

Just got lucky!

Now, who can answer this?

He hasn't asked it yet,
ass-kissers.

Churchill declared war while
sipping a Long Island Iced Tea.

The Magna Carta,
French Revolution,

my three divorces,

what's the common denominator?

Booze, duh.

Booze, duh!

She didn't raise her hand.

Boy, we have got some
eager beavers here, don't we?

Ha, that's what my pimp told us
at our working brunch.

Now...

I have only one rule.

No--

(iPhone rings)

Interruptions.

This is crazy; no one
has called me in six years.

I would have guessed longer.

(laughs)

Oh!
Thanks, Julie.

Let's make some drinks!

Oh, my God.
I love school so much.

How am I expected
to know the difference

between a vodka sunrise
and a vodka sunset?

12 hours and
a missing pair of pants.

Now, shh.
I'm studying.

That was the first homework
I've ever done.

I've never seen you
take anything this seriously.

And you had rabies once.

Stop joking around.
This is for school.

Where did you get those glasses,
 The Golden Girls?

For the first time in my life,
I want to learn goodly.

Max, have we switched bodies?

If so, enjoy chlamydia.

(sighs)
I want to do well on this test.

I want to get a, uh...

what's the good letter?

It's an A.

And I think this is gonna be
the first time I don't get one.

I am just not connecting
to the material.

Like sci-fi comedy,
I mean, pick a lane.

Well, give me that book

'cause I'm gonna nail
this bartending exam

like it's some guy
I met at the grocery store.

Most of my tests just had
"see me" written at the top.

Mine always had,

"You've done it again,
Caroline Channing."

And I have to do it again.
Let me try making a drink.

Okay.
Bartender?

Make me a Bloody Mary.

The drink,
not my friend Mary Nichol

who got her period
in fourth grade.

I have to get this.

I know the bloody part
is tomato juice,

but what the hell is the Mary?

I should know.
I've dated so many.

I'll give you a hint.

Rhymes with "schmodka."

Grodka!

That's not even a thing.
What is wrong with me?

Vodka.

Um, that was clam juice.

Sure was.

(bell dings)
Pick up, hot...

doll.

The Sophie doll?

Well, it's covered in hair

so it'll pass as food
around here.

Just get rid of it.

Sophie's constantly using it
to criticize me,

so I disconnected her app.

I mean, how many times
can she yell at me

to wash my hands
after going to the bathroom?

Every time?

That doll is driving me crazy.

Plus, I think I'm...

starting to have
feelings for it.

Fine.

I'll take her.

I haven't had a possessed doll

since Chucky moved out in '09.

Now, he could make
a Bloody Mary.

And a bloody Denise
and a bloody Julio.

Speaking of creepy dolls
come to life.

Han, if you have open sores,
you have to go home.

Not that it's stopped
anyone else who works here.

I can't go home.

I took an oatmeal bath
to get rid of the itching,

and it flooded my apartment.

I tried eating it down,

but I passed out
and nearly suffocated.

Well, find a nice subway bench
to curl up on.

Or even a Subway sandwich.

You know how embarrassing
it would be to catch a disease

from a guy I haven't slept with?

(gasps)

What?
Do I have something in my teeth?

Yes, of course.
But not that.

Max,
I think you have chicken pox.

Well, I could make this
less embarrassing for you.

We could have sex.

Ugh.

I can't believe
that little Outbreak monkey

gave me the pox!

If I get my mittens on him,
I'm gonna tear him

from tiny limb
to tiny limb.

Best I stay
in the bathroom then?

No.

Come on out,
patient-zero-friends.

I need you to enter
your Netflix password.

It's "Han job 69."
You're the one who set it.

And thanks for letting me
crash here.

I'm not sure you can legally
make me your butler for life,

but I did sign the contract.

I'm still feeling
a little woozy.

Hello, Sophie.

Don't change the subject.

For the first time,
I really wanted to go to school.

I know I could fit
your head in my toilet,

but I wonder if I can get
your whole body in there.

Wow, you really put the "bitch"
in "itch."

Could you?

Ah, that's the stuff.

Now get my back.

You like that?
Is it hard enough?

Am I hurting you?

Don't flatter yourself.

Don't stop till I get enough.

OLEG: Won't that be easier
if Max takes her shirt off?

Oleg!

Are you spying on us?

OLEG: Momma.

I am so screwed.

The bartending test
is in two hours,

and I can't remember
what goes in a White Lady.

A bottle of chardonnay and then
a fat guy that makes her laugh.

OLEG: Is that Caroline?

She sounds like
she's not wearing underwear.

How did Oleg get inside
the doll?

Wish it was the first time
I said that.

OLEG: I got the app,

and now I have a Saturday night.

SOPHIE: Oleg, have you seen
my Sophie doll?

OLEG: Uh...I haven't seen her.

(whispers)
Gotta go.

Wait, this thing
works with any phone?

Oh, my God, Max,
we can use the doll so

you can read me the ingredients
for drinks on the test.

You mean cheat?
At school?

Wow, maybe we did switch bodies.

-Rats.
-Oh, thank God.

Is there any way I could
get either of you

to scratch my tum-tum?

Here.

Ooh.

The nails are real.

Nice shirt, nerd.

Ooh, nice shirt.

Thanks, Mr. B.

Any love for my shirt?

Mm, feels desperate.

Hey, where's Max?

A bunch of us are going
to Chili's after class.

Max is sick,
but I'm totally free.

Mm, reservation's only for ten.

But Max isn't here,
so I can take her spot.

You'd think.

What's that?

Oh, this is my
emotional support doll.

I brush her hair
and it calms me down.

I'm not insane.

Hey, I've been saying
that for 30 years!

All right, kiddies,

I need ten drinks
in ten minutes.

Or, as a blacked-out me
once said,

"Let's get this starty parted."

Begin.

Max, are you there?

Can you see the set-up?

I see you and Julie both

shop at Tommy Bah-Brown Nose.

Care for a cinnamon stick
in your cocoa?

Never mind, a millipede
carried it off.

How's school?
Did anybody ask about me?

Tell Keith whassup.

And tell Dave whassup,
but not in front of Keith.

Max, focus.

The first drink I have to make
is a Negroni.

And I'll tell you how to make it

as soon as you relay
a message to Jeff

that goes a lot like this:

whassup.

(sighs)

Max says, "Whassup, whassup."

Okay, I'm listening.

Gin.

MAX: No, that's not gin.

Did you even go to kindergarten?

It's the one right next to it.

Got it.

Wow, I am really cheating.

I am such a bad girl.

Here we go,
hot cocoa Han-style.

Complete with a frothy
marshmallow layer.

Ooh, marshmallows.

And marshmallows, got it.

No, no, no, not you.

I was talking to Swiss Miss
over here.

[both screaming]

Aah...

choo.

Man, you are acting
crazier than me

when I was stalking Tom Hanks.

It's okay, it's okay.

(stammers) You spilled
all over the book.

I can't read a thing.
How is this okay?

Because...

that was your cocoa.

Mmm.

How do you like
your girl Swiss Miss now?

You better grab something
to dry this book off.

Bookoff?
Is that a vodka?

I'm panicking.
I'm gonna fail.

(hair dryer blowing)
Aah!

(hair dryer blowing loudly)

Aw,

cheating on a bartending test?

I am gonna tell you the same
thing I told The Situation:

you take it on back to Jersey.

Good one, Mr. B.

Oh, thanks, Julie.

I am so sorry, Mr. Bronski.

Please don't fail me.
I'll do anything.

-Oh.
-But nothing sexual.

Oh.

I mean, after all,
it's just bartending school.

I'm gonna take
this doll with me.

She's gonna be our tenth
at Chili's.

MAX: (gasps)

Hey, Mr. B, whassup!

Hi, Max.

I just can't get it
out of my head.

It was terrible.

He ripped apart the doll
right in front of me.

And then this part
I couldn't even tell you,

I f...

-Failed?
-Farted!

You know how my stomach gets
when I'm upset.

Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

I woke up with
me and Han spooning.

(gasps)

Which spoon were you?

The one with the stiffie
in her back for three hours.

Hey, everybody.

We just stopped in
for a Jolly Rancher shot

on our way to a live sex show.

Sophie, where's the baby?

Oh, she's with the babysitter.

Some perverted SOB
stole my Sophie doll.

I realized that

it's okay
not to watch baby Barbara

for 24-8.

You know, in Poland,
we get the extra day.

For dredging the lakes.

Why don't you go
get us a table, Sophie?

Okay.

Any chance of getting
that doll back?

I really underestimated how
strong my feelings for it were.

I know.

I was the one who walked in
on you brushing her hair.

And I was the one who
asked you not to repeat that.

I'll have a mojito.

Sorry, we don't do
off-menu drinks.

I'm on it.

Bup-bup-bup!

One mojito coming up.

What are you doing?
We failed the class.

Ooh, first time
I didn't fart saying that.

You failed.

Between studying
and helping you cheat,

I learned how to make
every drink in that book.

Oh, my God, Max,
you learned something.

I failed so you could succeed.

So in a way,
I succeeded too.

You've done it again,
Caroline Channing.

OLEG: Oh, yeah!

Oh.
The live sex show is here.

(cash register dings)

(upbeat rock music)

*

I'll go check on your salads.

Oleg, what's the hold up
with the salads?

I never made one before.

My two favorite guys,
Big Doug and Sancho,

are ordering salads?

What happened
to their usual BLTs?

Burgers, lasagna,
and tacos?

They said they
want to lose weight.

And no matter
what you order,

it's easier to
throw up here than at home.

I don't get why nobody
wants to be fat anymore.

The fat seasons of Oprah
were always the best.

You're right.

Every other year of Oprah
was the best years.

What is this I hear about you
blushing beauties on a diet?

Oh, we're not blushing.

We're just still
flushed from sitting down.

And we're trying
to get in shape.

Yeah, preferably a shape
that doesn't resemble

a seasonal gourd.

Plus my girlfriend
wants me to slim down

so we can sit on the same side
of the plane when we travel.

Well, Big Doug,

you tell that lucky lady
that I would rather date a man

with boobs bigger than mine

than a man who brings his own
salad dressing to a restaurant.

Pie me.

Cherry, pumpkin,
or coconut cream?

(both)
Yes.

Max Black,

bringing smiles
to men's faces since puberty.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

I just talked
to this guy at--

I think it's table three,
I still don't know the numbers.

Anyway, he asked,
"What's new?"

And I told him we were
opening a dessert bar

at the airport tomorrow.

Then I realized he was
asking what kind of pot

I was selling this week.

Why are you telling people
about us and the airport?

It's like when you told everyone
you thought you had HPV.

That was a state-mandated
kind of thing.

Oh, look who it is--

the airport people.

You guys putting together
a little happy hour?

With the jocks at Southwest?

Or the "in crowd"
at the Virgin Terminal?

You know who's going
to be a terminal virgin?

You can make all
the death threats you want,

but you know what
will keep me alive?

The fact that you two
work at the airport.

[laughing]

Hey, everybody!

Here comes the almost bride.

Did you ever see
a prettier almost bride?

I mean, you know,
besides Jennifer Aniston.

Sophie, it's only one week
till the wedding,

so this is your last chance
to take a run at me.

Now you won't be disappointed.

I'm still very sexually active

for the first five minutes.

Oh, Earl.

If I took a run at you,

you'd go right through that wall
like Wile E. Coyote.

Hey, bridesmaid.

(both)
Hey, Sophie.

Hey, Oleg.

You got a message from
your brother in the Ukraine.

Yoshinko called?

Yeah,
hear this message.

What was the message?

"Hey, Oleg,
did you see last night's Alf?"

Nah...
I don't speak Ukrainian.

I mean, what am I,
a plumber in Queens?

No, so I brought
the whole thing in.

Here he is.

Oleg...

[speaking Ukrainian]

Good-bye.

[speaking Ukrainian]

What did he say?

He's not coming.

I understood a little

'cause I had a Russian
au pair growing up.

You know, until she
bleached my good jeans.

Yoshinko can't come
to the wedding.

He's on a no-fly list,
a no-drive list,

and a no-walk list.

He's in jail.

Oh, but he was
gonna be your best man.

I got a ham
engraved for him.

Don't worry, baby,
I'll find someone.

It could be anyone.

He doesn't even have to be
the best or even good.

I'll have to
lower my standards.

Han,

will you be my best man?

You said lower,
not sub-basement.

Well, Oleg,
I'll need to think about it.

Yes.

Great.
So Han,

you're in charge
of the bachelor party tomorrow.

I want a night that will
disgrace all involved.

A night where no one can look
each other in the eye

at brunch the next day.

Wow, Han.

Bachelor party's
a big responsibility.

Do you know any grown-ups
who can buy you beer?

[rock music]

¶

Max, hurry.

The grand opening of
this pink airport dungeon

is in a few minutes.

That TSA line
took forever.

The woman with
all those nickels?

I haven't seen that much change
on a lady since Chaz Bono.

Don't worry,

I'm making friends
in the TSA.

Judy, big gal,
little beard?

Having lunch with her
at the Wok N' Roll

near Malaysia Airlines.

It's pretty quiet
over there these days.

Hey, ladies.

Opening day,
I'm so excited

my nipples have been shooting
daggers since I woke up.

Seriously, I haven't been
this excited

since my parents sent me
to military school.

God, does everything have
to be fun when you're gay?

If it isn't,
you're not doing it right.

I'm just happy I get
to be out front here.

Finally, I won't be
stuffed in the back.

I mean unless I run
into a Republican senator

in the men's room.

Come on,
let's open up.

But dat key though?

I love this job.

Wait, should someone
make a speech?

A speech?

If you want to hear my thoughts
on opening this place,

I'll just CC you
on my suicide note.

Fine, I'll make a speech.

To all the school janitors who
told me I'd never have

my own giant set of keys,

too big for any pocket,

and that I wasn't
a good kisser?

They can all suck it.

Yes! Rise, gate, rise!

Ooh, you go, gate.

[laughs]

Yes, I'm drunk with power.

Also, a little drunk.

All right.
Here they come.

Yep.

Any minute.

Just our luck.

The one day
the airport isn't crowded.

Well, I guess I have time
to go check my make-up

in the men's room.

[phone vibrates]

It's Han.

He wants us to come to Oleg's
bachelor party tonight.

I've gotten a call
like this before,

but usually it's through
a service that involves

making some tassels spin
in opposite directions.

No way.

You know I was planning on
going home and crying tonight.

Han is planning a party.

You will cry there for sure.

That's true.
I really can cry anywhere now.

I guess I've got that at least.

I can't believe I work
at the airport, Max.

Hey, would you feel better
if you held my giant keys?

Hello?

Hello.

Welcome, you're
our first customer.

Do I get a prize?

Is it you?

I'm on board now.
I love this job.

Welcome,
everyone.

I'm your M.C.,
Han Lee,

gonna get the crazy party
started here

with some dirty, racy jokes.

This is the deadest place
I've ever been to,

and I once
woke up in Heaven.

Okay, here we go.

What do a Rubik's Cube
and a penis have in common?

The more you play with it,
the harder it gets.

A Rubik's Cube was
a popular '80s toy.

You suck!
Next act.

[laughter]

What do a walrus and a
Tupperware have in common?

Hold on a minute.

Something about
a seal being tight...

[phone dings]

[gasps]
Oh!

I just got a text
from Josh, the pilot.

He says,
"What's up, you?"

Isn't that cute?

Cute that he
forgot your name?

It's really been a long time
for you, hasn't it?

I took off my underwear last
week and a coyote howled.

Tough crowd.

I'm talking about you, Max.

Oh come on, Han.
Loosen up.

Have a drink.

A martini, an appletini,
anything teeny.

Nah, just do a vodka shot.

If nothing else, the glass will
look normal-sized in your hand

and I'll have a laugh.

[laughs]

Can't hurt.

But it did.

Thanks for the party, Han.

What time is it starting?

I've never been a best man.

It's a lot of pressure.

Yeah, being a man
would be hard for you.

You've never
been one before.

Let alone the best one.

What's in that,
ground glass?

Ugh, this party is worse than
the communist party.

And they killed
half my family.

Oleg, don't worry,
I'll get this party started.

I'm making a call to some girls
I went to school with.

The Slut Academy on Seventh.

Commonly known as NYU.

I'm more concerned
about my cousin.

He has something I need.

Soap? Deodorant?
The toughest actin' Tinactin?

Oh, there he is!

- [laughs]
- Hey, hey.

Mwah, mwah.

Well, he didn't
bring the deodorant.

Yuri, you made it.

Are you the stripper?

Probably in a few years.

Did you bring the papers?

The papers I need
to get married?

And those little
Ukrainian candies I love?

Bad news.

The guy who made
the fake papers got deported.

They took the papers.

I ate the candy.

What'd I miss?

Besides my chance
to become something?

Are you the stripper?

Nyet.

A compliment and an insult
in just one word.

Oh, no.

Oh no, no,
no, no, no.

Did I mention "no"?

How can you say the word "no"

but not understand it
when women say it?

This is a disaster.

And not the kind
where I can loot.

I needed those fake papers to
renew my fake green card.

Mine expires next month.

Since when do you care
about expiration dates?

You cook with eggs so old
they fight back.

Sophie will never believe
that I'm not marrying her

just for a green card.

She has major trust issues

since one day, her father
went out for pierogies and...

came back without pierogies.

[soulful music playing]

I'm really enjoying
the dance stylings

of Camel and Toe up there.

Everyone is having fun
except Oleg.

I haven't seen him so much as
put the "V" fingers

in front of his mouth at
any of these ladies.

Ooh!

Wouldn't mind some over
the sweater action with her.

Hers or yours?

Max, I just did something
I've never done.

Told a story
about someone else?

No, I sent
the pilot a boob pic.

[gasps]

Girl, you nasty.

I know.
I am nasty!

I just looked into the camera
with my boobs out and hit send.

Ah-ha, that's awesome.

Uh, circling back now,

did you say you looked
into the camera?

You didn't put your face
in it, did you?

Girl!

You stupid.

How else would he
know it was me?

You never put
your face in it.

Didn't I raise you
better than this?

Well, at least you
weren't smiling in it.

All right,
what kind of smile?

A flirty smirk could work.

A come-hither grin
would be great.

More like...

So you were in this...
pose

with your yabbos out?

So you basically did
a nude yogurt ad.

Yeah, but like yogurt you
want to have sex with, right?

Oh, my God.

Sophie will be
here any minute.

When I called,
she was washing her hair.

She was going to put it
back on her head and come.

Just be honest with her.

Sometimes the truth is ugly.

But she knows that.
She's seen you naked.

Well, still no text back so
apparently not as ugly as this.

What's that about?

Are you selling
real estate now?

[Rufus's
Tell Me Something Good]

¶ Tell me something good ¶

Oh, wow.

I mean, this party couldn't
get any sleazier

unless you invited Robin Thicke.

I'm looking up
at skanky whore city,

but I trust you, Oleg.

You do?

Yeah, why wouldn't I?

Aside from
my complicated past

full of men
that have lied to me.

But you and I don't have secrets
from each other, right, Oleg?

Yeah, well, you see--

It is time for
the traditional best man speech.

So listen up, bitches.

Ow, damn it.

I am bleeding.

Repeat,
I am bleeding.

I can't believe this.

There's an app that burps
when you shake your phone,

but no app that
unsends a boob pic?

[clears throat]

Sophie.
Oleg.

What's there to say
about these two kids?

Oleg is a bad cook.

Sophie, quite loud.

But somehow, when they
get together, magic.

You suck,
next act!

Says the lady that
works at the airport.

And, Oleg, I'm so glad
Sophie is marrying you

so now you can
stay in the country.

(Max)
Oh, no. Uh...

You suck.
Next act?

Yeah, I hear ya girl.

I mean that last joke
didn't even have a punch line.

Yeah, I mean,
it was sort of sad.

It was no joke.

This is serious.

It's really serious.

That boob pic is up
in the Cloud now.

My boob is
in the Cloud, y'all.

Sophie, I didn't
know how to tell you.

You wanted to marry me
for a green card?

See, I thought you were
marrying me for my bod.

Or for my connections at
The Container Store, or...

I mean, I taught
you how to read!

Sophie, I can explain.

No, no, no.
The wedding's off.

Oh, no.

What the hell am I going to do
with all those pigeons

that I had painted
wedding white?

Sophie, wait.

[hisses]

¶

Aww, well,
look who it is.

My dearly deported.

I worked on that
the whole way over.

Sophie,
I'm not gonna be deported.

I'm gonna marry someone so
I can stay in this country

and win you back.

I don't care who
my new bride is.

Just upfront,
it can't be me.

'Cause everybody knows
I'm married to my work.

And it can't be me.

It just can't.

They don't even have to be
the best or even good.

Standards are out
the window.

Look,
it's a California Raisin.

Ooh. Sunglasses and Advil.

Last night was mad real.

(Oleg)
Han,

will you marry me
so I can stay in the country?

I'll need to think about it.

Yes.

Apparently the only thing he
won't say yes to is health care.

Oleg, I don't believe you.

This is just another trick
to get me to do

what you want me to do.

Like when you kept "dropping"
your ice cream into your lap.

No trick.

Sometimes love makes you do
crazy, disgusting things.

Like this.

[sprays mouthwash]
Come here, Han.

And now I love
this job, too!

Thank God he picked Han.

Wow, Sophie.
Oleg must really love you.

That had to be hard for him.

And from what I can see,
a little hard for Han, too.

At our wedding,
maybe two pumps of breath spray.

Han,
you're not marrying Oleg.

'Cause Oleg's marrying me.

I believe you now.

'Cause you kissed Han,

and Asian girls
aren't even your thing.

Oh my God, Max,
it's my boob pic.

Someone made it
into a meme.

A mammo meme?

You're not supposed to need
those 'til you're 40.

My boob pic is gonna be hanging
over me for the rest of my life.

Oh, come on,

your boob couldn't
hang over a pencil.

[cash register bell dings]

Max, look out,
you're so tired

you're spilling batter
all over yourself.

Ugh.

I knew it was only
a matter of time

before I became
a battered woman.

This is
a huge disappointment.

I heard that.

You don't even know
what I'm referring to.

Oh, I just assumed we were
talking about everything.

I'm referring
to our expensive

new cupcake website.

Not one job offer.

You want a website that will make you
feel better about yourself?

Go to
models-falling-down.com

Klum goes boom.

It's 3:00 A.M.
Who would be coming over now?

I don't know,
my dealer, my other dealer?

That guy who always asks
if I know where my dealer is?

- Who is it?
- You can't handle

what's on the other
side of that door.

Yesterday,
I saw a guy on a stoop

frenching his cat.

I can handle anything.

Oleg, what are you
doing here?

And you put the, "oh, no,"
in kimono.

Your upstairs neighbor
Sophie

is allowing me
to have sex with her.

And I came down to borrow
some sensual oils.

Preferably,
ones that you can eat.

How did you
get out of apartment?

You know the rules.

I came down
to borrow sensual oils.

Yeah, but no peppermint.

It makes his tongue swell.

And let's face it,

his tongue is the best part
about him.

You're right,
I can't handle that.

those nice smelling men
in booth two

just asked me
if I was on the down-low.

What does this mean?

They said,
"are you on the down-low,

because we have a friend
who is a big-time rice queen."

Again, coming up dry.

Rice queen, is it, like,
a Korean dairy queen?

Kind of.

Here's table seven's check,
Earl.

Max,
the guys at booth two

just asked Han
if was on the down-low.

They think he's gay.

That's a step up.

Usually people think
he's a lesbian.

Here you go, Sophie.

Uh, Max, Caroline.

Yeah, about last night,

I hope we can keep that
just between us girls.

I'm sure we have all
done things in the dark

late at night with men
that we'd like to forget.

Why stop at late at night
in the dark?

How about early morning?

Or a nooner at
the port authority bus terminal?

Oh, good.

And you too understand,
Caroline?

Actually, no, sorry.

I haven't ever done
anything with a man

- that I'm ashamed of.
- Oh, yeah.

But your father did
steal millions

and millions of dollars.

So... don't forget that.

Han just sat
your favorite gays.

Max, their names
are Steven and Michael.

And it's not very P.C. To reduce
people to a stereotype.

- Hey, girl.
- What's up, care bear?

Yeah, they're not
stereotypes.

What would you say
if they called you

"the big-boob waitress from
the wrong side of the tracks

who had sex
with everyone in high school"?

I'd say,
"that's why I love the gays.

They get me."

Come over and say hello.

They're the first
and practically the only

people that ever hired us
to do a cupcake job.

Do I have to?

Can't I just stand here
and judge from afar?

Come on, and let's not
mention how bad we're doing.

We want them to think
we're a big success,

so they'll recommend us
for their friends' events.

Yeah, because you know the gays,
they party about everything.

And there's
another stereotype.

- Hi, guys.
- Happy leap year!

F.Y.I., people
are still talking about

those cupcakes you made
for our wedding shower.

- Everyone.
- How's business?

Fabulous, amazing,
killing it.

Or it's killing us.
We're not quite sure.

I'll go grab some menus
for you girls.

- Max.
- Sorry.

I'll go grab some menus
for you ladies.

Love her... so Madeleine Stowe
in revenge.

Oh, she is.

- I don't watch that.
- We love it.

It's all about
a young blonde woman

who's out to seek revenge
on everyone

for destroying her family.

Yeah, too close to home.

- Max, guess what.
- Caroline, you're not

supposed to tell me
I'm on intervention

until the actual
intervention.

I just got offered $600

to stay at Steven
and Michael's apartment

and watch their dogs
while they're out of town

- for two days.
- Why would anyone pay $600

to watch dogs
for two days?

Well, because, you know,
they want a certain

amount of attention
to be paid to the...

Just say it, they're gay and they think
their dogs are their children.

Max, you have to stop
doing this.

I'll stop
when they stop.

This is so exciting.

It'll be like a paid vacation
at an amazing hotel.

And I need to get as far away
from here as possible.

- Oh, where do they live?
- Four blocks away.

Well, have a good time.

And while you're
four blocks away

having your vacation,
I'll be home

maybe taking a little
masturbacation.

What are you
talking about?

I wouldn't go on vacation
without you.

We'll split the dog money
to cover the shifts

we take off
from the diner.

Well, thanks,
but I don't do that thing

where you take off work.

"Hi, I'm Max, I can't go

"to a fancy apartment
and have fun.

"I'd rather work
in a steel mill

and sing
Bruce Springsteen songs."

Max, when was the last time
you had a vacation?

Never.

Unless you count
the summer I hid

under the front porch
from my mom's new boyfriend.

We really need
to get out of here.

This is more than just
spring break.

It's a break
from the diner,

from the cupcake business,
from being poor,

from everything
depressing right now.

Things aren't
that depressing.

Oh.

Yeah, well,
I'm sure we have

all done things with men
in kitchens that...

We are not proud of.

Spring break
is the greatest time ever.

You just go crazy
and do shots

and throw all the rules
out the window.

Oh, I've done that.

But when you're poor,
you just call it Tuesday.

Why are you
walking like that?

This is my
spring break walk.

These shoulders
have shimmied like this

all the way
from Majorca to Ibiza.

Try it, Max.
Shake a little.

- Shake.
- That's cool.

I'll just wait till
I get the DTS later.

Maybe I don't
have the right key.

Oh, hi.

Sorry, I think we might
be at the wrong door.

That's a bummer
for the door.

It's over there, 12d.

We're house-sitting
for a few days.

Cool, I'm Brendon.

Hey, Brendon.
I'm Ashley.

- And...
- I'm surprised.

- And also Max.
- I'd shake your hands,

but I kind of stink.

I've been at my microbrewery
most of the day,

so I am sorry
if I smell like yeast.

Hey, that's my apology.

Whoa, all right, cool.

Well, I will see
you guys around, yeah?

Yeah, totes.

You have something
you want to tell me, Ashley?

I never use Caroline channing
on vacation

for security reasons.

I was almost abducted
at gunpoint

for a ransom
in Mexico city.

Wow, gunpoint.

Were you using the word,
"totes" at the time?

Can you take out the paper
that has the alarm code on it?

Wow, this place
is amazing.

It's, like, the cover
of gay gay gay magazine.

Max, you have to stop
reducing them

to that gay stereotype.

Now, read me
the security code.

It's..."Liza."

A lot of different
types of people

like Liza Minnelli.

Oh, look,
it's a poodle in a tutu.

That's not gay, right?

Lots of...
Lots of different

types of people
have a poodle in a tutu...

Named Barbra Streisand.

Oh, there's the book
of instructions.

"Hey, girl.
Hey, care bear.

"Have fun with Barbra Streisand
and Wynonna Judd.

"Wynonna is a little
temperamental

"and tends to stay
in the bedroom.

"We didn't have time to purge
her anal gland before left.

Instructions on page two."

I'm starting
to understand the $600.

"Don't worry, it's easy.
We do it all the time."

No wonder Wynonna's
so temperamental.

"Help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

There are portable saunas
in the closet."

Portable saunas?

Love it, what is it?

This is so cool.

I'm hot
like I'm at the beach,

but I'm not stepping
in any used condoms.

Yeah, these are great.

My friend
Candice travelstead

used one to make weight
for prom.

Are you done with that?

Yeah, switch?

On spring break,
I always loved

spending the day
at the beach.

Just the chilling
and the girl talk.

Yeah.
Tell me again,

about the sound the anal gland
made when you squeezed it.

Please, stop.

I already told you twice.

And now, wynonna Judd
won't even look at me.

Well, not without
her lawyer in the room.

I'm hungry.
What do you eat on vacation?

Anything we want.

Let's see.

I bet their refrigerator is
stocked with all kinds of pates

and cheeses
and those parm crisp things.

By the way, nice suit.

You look like someone should
be pouring a 40 on you

in a rap video.

Thanks.

There's nothing.

I mean, come on,
what kind of gays are they?

All anal gland
and no cheese.

I just expected
everything to be better.

You know,
champagne on ice,

thousand
thread-count sheets.

I mean, the towels...
They're not even bath sheets.

Wait, the towels
aren't good?

Because I already stole two.

They're fine,
they're just not

what I was expecting.

What's happening
over there?

You could use
a little shoulders.

You're right,
enough, we're on vacay.

Come on, let's go get dressed
and find someplace to eat.

Are you crazy?
I am not leaving this thing.

This is the happiest
I've ever been in my life.

Okay, we'll order in,
pretend it's room service.

They must have a menu drawer
here somewhere.

Plus, we'll never
find a restaurant

with a portable sauna
section.

"Food network party tonight

"to celebrate
the release of a cookbook.

Food and drink provided."

Free foodie food,
free foodie drinks?

- Yay, let's go.
- No, I like it in here.

It's amazing.

Ashley wants to go.

Ashley wants to go.

Fine,
but can I bring the dog?

I've always wanted
to be one of those girls

who brings a tiny dog
to a public place

and just
looks at everyone, like,

"yeah, I have a tiny dog,
so what?"

You can be whoever
you want to be.

You're on vacation.

I'm gonna go invite
Brendon to come.

You gotta have a crush
on spring break.

Well,
I'm sitting in my crush.

Hey, shouldn't you
put something on?

Uh, it's spring break.

Aah!

Barbra, get help.

Go, Barbra Streisand, go.

Hey,
look at the book title,

Bacon.

Heaven bacon.
That's good wordplay.

It's okay.
Not much of a crowd.

Party's a little
disappointing.

Bacon truffle,
Barbra Streisand?

Mm?

Yeah, I'm feeding my tiny dog
a truffle, so what?

Miss, miss.

Excuse me,
what are these things for?

Oh, it holds your drink
while you get food.

- No!
- Yeah.

Yeah, these are great when
you see them for the first time.

For me,
it was on a yacht

in the Mediterranean.

You know what else
these are good for?

Frees up your shoulders
to shimmy.

You shimmy.
I'm gonna walk over here

and find us a bigger, shinier
something to do later.

Later?
We're going home

- to our amazing apartment.
- Or not.

Come on, Max,
it's spring break.

Let's not get tied down.

I'll be over there.

Yeah, we'll be over there.

Oh.

Hi. You're not allowed
to have dog in here.

Unless he wants
to buy the book.

What are you,
some kind of foodie bouncer?

Worse.
I wrote the book.

Yeah, nice sleeves.

You get those in
the tattoo gold rush of '09?

I'm Zeke.
What's your name?

I'm Max.
This is my tiny dog.

I take her everywhere,
so what?

Hey, Max, you wanna try
my thick-cut bacon?

Maybe. Let's just
take things slow.

I'm telling you,
it serves

the best
vegan stew anywhere.

You really should put it
in your blog.

Oh, if I write one more
article about something vegan,

all of my devoted
10,000 readers will hold hands

and jump collectively
out a window.

And I know you like to find
what's new and what's next.

Chocolate bacon?

I just need
a minute over there.

Hi, couldn't help
but overhear.

If you're looking
for what's new,

I found these
two adorable girls

who run a cupcake business

out of their home
in Williamsburg.

I know how that sounds,
but trust me,

totally fresh
and not at all overexposed.

And you're someone
I should listen to because...?

Sorry,
didn't introduce myself.

Ashley Emerson,
style editor for Elle.

Oh.

If you're interested,
I think I might have

a card in here somewhere.

Was holding on to it
for Martha.

Mr. Bacon action figure.

A world of bacon sampler.

And I want to apologize for
the food network trucker hat,

which has nothing
to do with bacon

and everything to do
with me being a sellout.

Guess what.

Ashley just gave our card

to a woman who's such a bitch
she must be important.

She's a food blogger.

It's a long shot,

but we need to get
some exposure.

Whoa, we are on vacation.

No business talk.
That was the deal, right?

This is Zeke, chef-slash-
author-slash-corporate sellout.

We were, uh...

We were thinking about
going back to the apartment

- to hang out.
- Oh, sounds fun.

Can I see you alone
for a second?

Well, not alone.

I bring my tiny dog
everywhere, so what?

Come on, I heard
of an after-party in Soho

and an after-after-party
in dumbo.

So, let's go-ho.

Have fun and get
this vacation started.

I'm holding a tiny dog
at a bacon-book party

and laughing with a guy
who wrote a book about bacon.

I think my vacation's
already started.

All right,
well, have fun.

I'm gonna go par-tay.

Eh, did your thing, Ash.

I don't want
to say that I'm hot.

But the bacon
in my pocket is done.

We said turns were
five minutes, you bastards.

Oh, hi.
More sauna fun.

Max, can I see you
in the hall for a second?

But it's my turn
to sweat my balls off.

Don't think the clock's
not running while I'm out there.

We're going
on a real vacation.

How quickly
can you pack a bag?

And don't worry about
appropriate evening wear.

Every four seasons
has a Gucci

near the Bulgari store
in the lobby.

None of those words
made any sense.

I think you've had
a spring break stroke.

No, seriously, there's a car
waiting downstairs

to take us
to a private plane.

We can be at Teterboro
in 20 minutes

and Tahiti in 8 hours.

The Greek
is paying for everything.

What did they give you?

What's the last thing
you can remember?

Nothing.

I just had some cristal.

Some cristal meth?

No, I'm just
really excited.

I went to the after-party
and this shipping magnate.

Don't worry,
it's not gonna be sexual.

More like a father thing.

Anyway, let's go... finally
got us a good vacation.

But we're having
a good vacation.

Max, don't take this
personally,

but you don't know what
a good vacation is

because you've
never been anywhere.

I mean, you walked
into that apartment

and your face lit up, like...
Like it was amazing.

And that's because
you don't know that it's not.

Trust me.
I've been everywhere.

And I'm telling you,
this is the worst vacation ever.

So let's ditch the bacon freak
and the beer bro,

get on that plane, spend
one great day at the beach,

and then come back
and make $8 an hour.

That sounds fun.

You kind of skipped over
the part where we get abducted

and Nancy grace
covers the year-long search

for our bodies.

It must be Constantine.
He's gonna be upset.

You never
keep a Greek waiting.

Oh, my God, Max,
we just got an email

on our website from that
food blogger at the book party.

She said if we drop off four
cupcakes by tomorrow morning,

she'll consider writing about
them for her column that day.

Well, what's it gonna be,
Caroline or Ashley?

Cupcakes or Tahiti?
Your call.

Is the Greek
still waiting?

He just pulled away.

I'm sure he'll come back here
for Ashley sometime.

And when that happens,
I wouldn't want to be her.

Well, after tomorrow,
you won't be.

What can I do?

You mean after
your two personalities

meet and kill each other?

Max, I told you
I needed a break.

I just didn't know it was
gonna be a psychotic one.

You really need
to chill.

You can't
keep freaking out

because you're not where
you want to be...

On vacation
or in our business.

I mean, it's life.
Lower your expectations.

This microbrew
is actually really good.

Tastes better
in the batter.

Hey, crumble up some of that
maple bacon for me.

Sorry about
that stuff I said

about you never having
gone anywhere.

Why?
I never have gone anywhere

or done anything.

And now I'm thinking
that's kind of a good thing,

because I can still
get excited and make a face

when something's new to me.

'Cause, basically,
everything is.

That must be nice.

All right, here,
taste it.

My beer-batter, maple bacon,
spring break cupcake.

Oh, my God, you made
the "something new" face.

I did, because
you made something new.

- It's delicious.
- Do the face again.

Oh, there they are,
the world travelers.

Shouldn't people be throwing
confetti or something?

I'm all out.

I snorted mine
in the power outage of '65.

How was your vacation?

Well, it turned out
to be more of a daycation,

but we had a great time,
didn't we, Max?

Yes, we did.

Max, things sure are dull
around here without you.

Everyone walking around
all P.C.,

nobody called me black.
Hell.

I haven't left once
since you've been gone.

When it comes to this job,
you are my vacation.

Aw.

And that, Earl,
is why I got

all five
of these gift bags for you.

Welcome, again,
to the Williamsburg diner.

This way, please.

I have looked up "down-low"
and "rice queen" on Wikipedia.

And, no, I'm not
a secret homosexual

or a man who chases
only Asian men.

I'm great, I'm straight.
Get used to it.

Hi, guys.
How was your vacation?

Great. Did you have fun
at our place?

Totes.
Your saunas are sick.

I know.
Could they be any gayer?

No.

Just one thing.
Wynonna's still a little upset

about the anal gland event.

What?

I told you she wouldn't
know it was a joke.

How could she not know
it was a joke?

I mean, who would ask someone
to squeeze their dog's pooper?

We're paying you
another 50.

Dude, she went
second knuckle deep

in your beagle's back door
for only another 50?

150.

Thank you.

And just one other thing.

Our business is actually
not that great right now,

so if you could recommend us
to any of your friends,

- that would really help.
- Good for you.

I'm sure business will
pick up after that blog blurb.

- Wait, blog blurb?
- About your beer-battered

maple bacon
spring break cupcake.

We just read about it.

Yeah, in that
foodie bitch's blog.

Max, it worked.

Let's go look at the blog
on Han's computer.

Excuse us.
We'll be right back.

We got a little break
and a big break.

Yeah,
I did it again.

Yeah.

Welcome back.

You missed the best
two days of my life.

- Max?
- No.

Don't come over here with that
"I'm the boss,

"you're the waitress" look.

Cause I could just as easily give you
the "I'm the murderer,

"you're the victim" look.

The muscular woman at table two

is sending her bagel back.

She said she ordered
a plain one.

I'm sorry, did you say
she wanted a multi-grain?

No, plain.

Whole grain?

No, plain.

Garlic?
No.

The plain! The plain!

It took me two years,

but I finally got him
to say it.

[cash register bell dings]


[Cat meowing]

Are you telling me
you don't hear that cat?

We have to let it in.

It's clearly a stray,

or this Marine I met last week
at a blood drive.

Last week there was a man
outside our door screaming,

"I've been stabbed,"

and all you did was yell,
"Shut up."

Because he said, "I think
I've been stabbed."

You're either stabbed,
or you're not stabbed.

[Cat moaning]

Listen, it sounds like
the cat's saying hello.

[Cat moans]

Hello, hello.

[Cat moans]

Listen, it's talking.

It's saying, "Help.
Can I come in?"

Really?

'Cause I think it's saying,

"I'm fine.
Go back to sleep."

[Cat moans]

Come on, it clearly just said,

"Let me in.
Ignore the blonde.

She's a bitch."

Look, you can't just
let in everything

that shows up at our door
and says hello.

Yeah, I can.
I've done it.

Max, we can't.

We can't become cat ladies.

And it always starts
out innocently,

rescuing a stray,

but then you have
to get another one

so that they can
entertain each other

while you're at work.

And then somewhere
along the line,

four more sneak in,
and you think,

"We're good.
We're cool.

We're the cute girls
with six cats."

And then, one day, there
you are on Animal Cops,

screaming,
"Don't take my babies!

These 27 angels
is all I got!"

That's how it goes, Max.

Once you get one, you get 27.

Not true.

Really?

How many garden gnomes

do you have under your bed?

27.

What?

They understand
I'm only keeping them there

until I get a yard.

Come on.
I want a kitty.

Kitty for Max.
Kitty for Max.

Max, we already have a horse.

We can't afford another animal.

We're broke.

Come on.

Chestnut needs a friend.

He is dying to
trash us to someone,

and all he's got is that rat

who is super
self-involved.

[Knock on door]

Who the hell is that?

It's so late.

It's probably the cat,

or the guy who's raping
girls in Brooklyn.

Open the door,
and roll the dice.

Oh, please.

Please, somebody tell me

they killed that damn cat.

And where did it learn
how to say hello?

Told you.

It's been keeping
me up all night.

This poor cat has been
crying at our door

every night trying to get in,

trying to get
a little warm milk,

maybe a skosh of tuna.

Max, that's our
dinner tomorrow.

Wait.
Be careful.

A cat is not always a cat.

Oh, please continue.

In Poland, we believe
if you die outside,

you're reincarnated as a cat.

Am I the only one
who thinks Poland

sounds like a real freak show?

So never let a cat in,

because it's just a person

that's been reincarnated

and will bring in
all the bad jus.

I think you mean juju.

Oh, do I?

Nighty-night.

[Cat moaning]

Look, we just have to put up
with it,

and after a while,
it'll go away on its own.

Go away on its own?

It's a stray cat,
not my father.

Good night, Max.

Fine.
No kitty for Max.

No kitty for Max.

See, Max, I told you
the cat would stop.

Max?

[Cat moans]

Max.

Can we keep it, ma?
Can we keep it?

Earl, you don't want
a cat, do you?

A cat?
God, no.

Cats steal your weed.

See, Caroline?

Nobody wants the cat.

We're keeping it,

and I think we should start
celebrating right meow.

Max, you didn't even try
to convince him.

Come on, Earl.

Don't you want a cat?

Kitty for Earl.
Kitty for Earl.

I'm too old to have a cat.

I'm about six months away

from crapping in a box myself.

Oleg, how do you
feel about cats?

Loved it.
Saw it nine times on Broadway.

Very clever show,

but a little expensive.

The most I've ever paid
to see a pussy dance.

So far we're keeping the cat.

Hey, Han, do you want a cat?

You could finally have
a friend your own size.

Come on, you could
ride it to work.

No, I can't have a cat.

They're lazy, moody,
and judgmental.

I don't need another you.

Plus, they don't
show affection.

Sure they do.

You just have to know
how to get it out of them.

Cats love to be lightly
spanked on their bottom.

I don't understand why
a cat would like that.

It's so mysterious.

Kitty. Kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

Kitty. Kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

Hmm.

Well, I can't have a cat.

I work all the time.

Why did I like that so much?

I don't know.

Something with boobs
was touching you.

People with boobs touch me.

She means aside from your mom.

Then, no.

Well, we've asked
everyone we know,

and now I'm depressed,
because this

is everyone we know.

Let's start asking people
in the diner.

We need to find it
a place to live.

Why?

Why can't it live
right here in my arm

in between my hot and naturals?

Kitty. Kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

I have to admit, that
does feel kind of good.

Excuse me.

I overheard you two
asking people

if they want a cat,

and I'd really love one.

Really?
Well, we have your cat.

Whoa. Whoa.
Not so fast.

I got a couple
of questions first.

Do you smoke?

Yes.

- Drink?
- Yes.

Prescription drugs.

Occasionally.

Forget the cat.

Will you take me home?

Kitty, you're gonna
love this lady.

She smokes, drinks,
does prescription drugs,

which we all know means Oxy.

Hi.

Oh, my God.
These she is.

She's purr-fect.

Come in.
Welcome home, you.

See, Max?
It's great.

[Cats meowing]

What the hell is
going on in here?

Look at all these cats

crammed in this little space.

It's so sad.

The only thing missing
is Sarah McLachlan

singing in the corner.

What?
It's fine.

There's not that many.

They're attacking!

Sorry.
He loves blondes.

And apparently pooping
on the carpet.

No, Twinkles, no.

Oh, okay, quick introductions.

That's Bethany,
Radford, Cellars,

Franklin, Eleanor,

Pudding, Mustachio,
Mitzi, Meredith,

Baxter, Bernie.

She remembers
all of their names?

I don't even remember
the name of the guy

I lost my virginity to.

Best I can do
is "Coach" something.

Well, Catherine,
I think it's lovely

that you have such a big,
loving hairy family,

kind of like the Kardashians.

There's only 24.

[Cat moaning deeply]

Oh.

31.

Let's go before one of
these rabid cats bites us

and we become half-human,
half-cat hybrids

who wander the streets
but are never cold.

We're just gonna go have
a little conversation

in the hall.

And F.Y.I.,
the mother looks

like she's eating
the little one.

Just a thought.

I'm only saying that
'cause it's in her mouth.

Mitzi, release!

Let's go!

In less than five minutes,

it went from 24 to 31,

and I saw two cats
in the corner

doing it doggie style,

so in two months, we could
be looking at 50 cats.

Max, you can't get pregnant
doggie style.

Right?

We can't go back in.

There's so much hair in there,

I saw a cat using
a lint roller.

Okay, but if we don't
leave her here,

we only have one other option.

No, Kitty is not
going to a shelter.

Why?
Lots of cats get adopted

and end up in beautiful homes.

Look, I didn't want
to say this,

but she's not pretty enough.

What are you talking about?

She's not pretty enough.

Come on, she doesn't have
classic good looks,

but she's adorkable.

We cannot take her
to a shelter.

She'll die there.

And, yeah, everyone
says they want one

with a nice personality,

but they really just want
a hot, sexy, young kitten

who still gets excited
about balls in her face.

Everything okay, ladies?

No, everything
is far from okay.

My boots are now UGGs,

thanks to all
the cat hair in there.

Ow!
Stop it!

Sorry, that's Gina.

She's bipolar, and she refuses
to take her meds.

Ow! Ow!
Stop it, Gina!

I'm sorry, Catherine.

This isn't gonna work out.

It's nothing personal.

It's just that you're crazy.

Truly, I'm heartbroken.

Ow! Ow!

I already have a name
picked out for her.

Veronica Two.

Ow! Stop it!

Ow! Ow!

I got to go!

Who wants to eat?

Um, just so we all know,

Veronica One committed
suicide, right?

Kitty, we're gonna
find you a nice home.

Want a cat?

Free cat?

Want a cat?

You are going to love it here.

Park Slope is like the
Beverly Hills of Brooklyn.

Here comes a good one.

Hey.
Want a cat.

Excuse me?

Cat?

Yeah, I'll take some crack.

She said "cat."

We're looking for
a nice home for a cat.

Oh, so no crack.

No.

Well, why would I want a cat?

I'm a crackhead.

Well, Kitty,

as hard as this is,

I think it's time to let you

back out there into the world.

At least we leave you
in a rich neighborhood;

you'll have a
better shot at life.

Max, you are okay with this?

Well, I was more okay

when I did this with
my cousin's baby.

There you go.

Oh, yeah.
Move him to the next house.

South-facing sun.
Pre-war building.

She'll love it.

There you go.

You live in Park Slope now.

You can adopt an African baby

and wheel it around
in a $900 stroller.

Can you believe
that was my plan "B"?

Run!
Run away.

Go.

Ah, screw it.
She lives here now.

[Gasps]
Ooh. Look.

They have a piano.

You can make videos.

You'll be a YouTube star.

[Discordant piano notes]
Bye, Kitty.

Wow, I'm shocked
you didn't stop me.

Stop you?

If I had known that was option,

I would have had you
stuff me in there.

I wonder what Kitty's doing

in her fancy
town house right now.

She's probably snuggling
with an older gay guy

who likes to read.

You know, 'cause gay guys

are the only ones
who still read.

They're probably
on the couch right now

with A Tale of Two Kitties.

I'm proud of us.

We selflessly gave
that cat a better life

than we could ever
afford for ourselves.

Oh, don't try to get in
on that.

I did the right thing.

You tried to leave her

at that crazy lady's
pussy riot.

Hi. Excuse me.

Would it be okay if I put this
flier next to your window?

No.
Sure.

We lost our cat, Jinxy,
like, a week ago

in this neighborhood.

Have you seen her?

No. No.

I haven't seen a cat
in a long time.

I was just saying
to her yesterday,

"I haven't seen a cat
in a long time."

Um, how come you didn't
have a collar on her?

And where's her I.D. tag?

Even my mother had
an I.D. tag on me.

Well, it was
a flea collar, but...

Why did it take you so long
to put the signs up?

Um, what's happening?

Um, here's what's happening:

We are more than happy

to put up this
flier of your cat,

which we have never, ever seen.

I mean, seriously, where
did all the cats go?

Queens?
Staten Island?

'Cause they're not
in this neighborhood.

Okay.

This was weird.

Is there any way
this cat isn't Kitty?

Nope, that's her.

Same green eyes,
same notch in the ear.

Hello.
Hello.

Oh, God.
Oh, God.

Hey, girls.
What's shaking?

Not me, 'cause I'm all held in.

Sorry, Sophie,
the cupcake window

isn't open during the day.

I don't need your life story.

I just need a damn cupcake.

Sophie, do you
remember that cat

that was crying outside
our building?

Yeah, you put it down?

We thought it was a stray,

so we tried to find
a home for it,

but couldn't.

So you put it down.

No.

We left it in a really
nice neighborhood.

Oh, so a rich person
put it down?

It turns out it
wasn't a stray at all.

We just met its owner.

This is the cat, Sophie.

Her name's Jinxy.

Oh, wait a minute.

Wait a minute.

You remember how I told you

that if you die outside
in Poland,

you come back as a cat?

Yeah, that's kind of
hard to forget.

That's not Jinxy.
That's my friend Nancy.

Look at her.

Same green eyes,

same notch in the ear.

Same whiskers.

I don't think that
this is Nancy.

Oh, yes.

She and I got in a big fight

and how she's come back
to haunt me.

She died waiting for
an apology from me,

and now she's back.

Guess what.

She's not gonna get it.

Jinxy!
Jinxy!

Jinxy, come on, girl.

Look, I said on the phone,

this area is where we
randomly spotted her.

I wonder how Jinxy got
all the way to Park Slope.

Just wait.
She's here, I promise.

Jinxy!

Jinxy!

Nancy.

Nancy!
Nancy!

Nancy!
Nancy!

Come on, Nancy!

Nancy, it's Sophie!

I'm here to apologize!

Um, what's happening?

Oh, my God.
It's Nancy.

I mean, Jinxy.

I mean, Kitty.

Ooh...

Hello.
Hello.

Hi, baby.

Kitty, kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

What she's doing, they like it.

I know, because I liked it.

Anyway, we found your cat.

Isn't that great?

Actually, she's
my boyfriend's cat.

I'm keeping her.

Max, just close your
eyes and look away,

like you do whenever
those people ask you

if you have a minute
to save the earth.

Just stick it in here.

"Just stick it in here"?

That's what I say when
my hand gets tired.

Maxy. Maxy.

Maxy, Maxy, Maxy.

Now do me.

First of all,

I own the diner now.

Secondly, don't ever
do that again.

I guess I'll just
have to spank myself.

No surprise there.

I hope you're happy.

I found Jinxy's owners
on Facebook.

Not one pic of Kitty,

not even a status update

saying,
"We found our cat."

But she is more than willing

to talk about her
reverse French manicure

and posts pictures of a meal

I know she's gonna make
herself throw up later.

Come on, Max.

There's got to be
one photo of Kitty.

Oh, wow.

You found one?

No, that manicure is heaven.

Max, photos or not,

we need to focus on the fact

that the cat is back with
the guy who loves her.

The guy who loves her?

He doesn't love Kitty.

If he did, why aren't
there any pictures of her

at his first wedding?

What, he couldn't spring
for a cat tuxedo?

They're, like, 20 bucks.

I know because I have one
on my garden gnome.

This is not a loving home.

Pics, or it didn't happen.

Okay, Max.
Okay, just say it.

I put the cat
in an abusive home.

You put the cat
in an abusive home.

I have a gift for you.

[Cat moans]

No way!
No way!

Oh, yeah, it's Jinxy.

It's Nancy.
Jinxy was her slave name.

Oh, Nancy, I missed you.

I missed you so much.

What did you do?
How did you get her?

Well, it was
really complicated.

I went to their apartment,
and I said,

"You don't love that cat,"

and they said,
"You're right. Take it."

Oh, my God!

Is this what happiness
feels like?

So what made you
change your mind?

Because two years ago
I was outside your door,

saying,
"Hello. Hello."

And you let me in,
and it changed my life.

That's kind of different,
though,

because I didn't want
to let you in,

and I did want to let
the cat in.

But you did let me in.

You let me in,
and you gave me food

and shelter and love.

Not the way I wanted
to give to the cat.

Max, are you trying
to equate a person's love

with a cat's love?

Not really.

A cat's love is eternal.

Hey, girls.

I'm heading over to
the bodega salad bar.

They just added hot ribs
and a sneeze guard.

You need anything?

Sophie, we got the cat back.

She was in a house
where she wasn't wanted.

Oh, yeah.

That is so Nancy.

Sophie, do you want
to see the cat?

She's in the apartment?

No, no, no.

No, no.

I can't see her right now!

It's too much!

I'm happy for you, Nancy!

But I can't do this right now!

[Screams]

Wait, where did the cat go?

Oh, no, Chestnut.

I left the back door open.

Oh, my God.
Look.

She's on top of Chestnut.

They like each other.

Why wouldn't they?

She's a foxy redhead,

and he's a stud.

You did the right thing.

Kitty, kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

Why do I like that so much?

'Cause something with boobs
is touching you?

Hi, ready to order?

Do you have anything
that's really special?

Not according to my
high school guidance counselor.

I'll have the veggie plate.

But instead of beets,
I want kale.

And instead of broccoli,
more kale.

I want the veggies steamed.

And instead of dressing,
I want lemons.

Don't you need
to write this down?

I'm afraid if I start
writing that down,

it'll turn into a suicide note.

I'm assuming
this table's gonna have

a lot more of those requests.

Yes, I could tell by the hats.

Earl, I have something new
I want you to try.

That's the exact same sentence

that got me hooked
on cocaine in the '80s.

It's my new cupcake flavor.

Delicious dark chocolate
the ladies can't help but love.

I'm calling it
"The Earl."

I know you got that right.

Hi, I'm here.

I was running late
so I decided to hail a cab.

And then I remembered I didn't
have any money on me.

And then I remembered
I didn't have any money at all.

So I walked the whole way here.

The apartment's
three blocks away.

Yes, I know.

Three blocks
and 15 "Hola chicas" away.

Well, you can't be late again.

I'm already worried
about me being late...

every month.

On my way here, a homeless man
asked me for money.

And I told him
that I usually always give,

but that my father was indicted
in a Ponzi scandal

and I've lost my family fortune
and my Manhattan townhouse,

so I've been sleeping
on a couch in Brooklyn,

but, in spite of it all,
I'm still optimistic

that you and I
will achieve success

in our exciting new cupcake
business venture.

I prefer to think
of Bob near the bridge

as our first investor.

Pickup!
Special sandwich.

I can think
of even more special sandwich.

You, me
and the hot blonde giraffe.

Well, she recently
lost her dignity,

so you might have a shot.

Hello today!

I have nametag for you.

Only your second day
and look, nametag already.

As new owner, I am killing it.

Thank you.

Oh, it says "Carolin."

It's Caroline.
With an "E."

I'm Caroline.

As new owner, I am sucking it.

Just put it on.

You can't tell an Asian
he made a mistake.

He'll go in the back
and throw himself on a sword.

Thank you,
Mr. Lee.

You may call me Han.

H-a-n.

No trap in my name.

I'm thinking we should take

the first step
in our new cupcake business

by writing
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes"

up on the specials board.

No, I can't have
my name up there.

Everyone I owe money to
thinks I live in Seattle.

Oh, we used to own Seattle.

Max, we've got to get
the name out there.

Create a buzz.

Ooh, good idea!

Let's create a buzz.

Exactly,
in order to launch--

I'm mocking you.

When in doubt,
I'm always mocking you.

Seriously, Max.

This new cupcake business
is our lifeline.

A way out for both of us.

And I wanna thank you again
for letting me move in.

If there's anything
I can do to help you--

You mean besides
starting to wait on tables?

I meant, anything I can do

to help you through
your breakup with Robbie.

Oh. Thanks,
but I'm fine.

And we're working.

Well, one of us is.

Are you sure you're fine?

'Cause I heard you
crying last night.

I don't cry.

I sold my tear ducts to an organ
bank for cash two years ago.

I was on the couch.

And I heard you crying alone
in your bedroom.

Really?
What did the crying sound like?

Like...

I wasn't crying.

Well, then what
were you d--

Oh! So none of
my business.

That's right.
And remember that.

Got it.

In fact, let's just say
that anything having to do

with my bedroom, my tables,
or my life--

you should stay away from.

Boundaries.
Got it.

And please
don't tell anyone at work

I let you move
into my apartment.

That is one boundary
we both don't want crossed.

Why?

Hey, roomies.

That's why.

Hope those sheets are okay.

Oh, don't worry about it.

I know they're the best
you could afford.

Not really.
The good ones are on my bed.

Max, that oven is so hot.

Could you do me a favor
and open the back door?

We've known each other two days

and you're already
asking for back door?

Dear God!

I forgot
you're Equestrian Barbie.

You came with a horse.

No.

Out, horse, bad!
Bad horse.

Chestnut.

No need to yell,
he's a champion.

Champion stink bomb.

It's smelling pretty ripe
out in that yard.

That's not Chestnut,
that's Brooklyn.

Okay, well, I'm watching
"The Champion"

drop some steaming hot
"Brooklyn" right now.

Max, I've been thinking about
how you completely overreacted

to your name
up on the specials board.

Do you think it's
a fear of success?

I am too poor
to have a fear of success.

At Wharton Business School,
we learned

that every new venture can bring
up a certain amount of fear.

Is there any way
to do a yelp review

of Wharton Business School?

Maybe you're having
a hard time imagining

this cupcake business
could ever even happen

because nobody ever believed
in you or your dreams.

I'm guessing.

I can make this happen, Max.

For me, for you, for us.

Just keep making
those amazing cupcakes.

And I'll do the rest
till you believe.

I believe
everything you just said

and that children
are the future.

Max, it's me!

I know it's you.

You sleep with a knife
under your pillow?

It's the only home security
system I can afford.

And I'm a cutter.

I can't sleep on that couch.

I think Ikea might be the
Scandinavian word for sciatica.

And there's weird sounds
in the street.

And I don't have
my white noise machine.

Well, that's
Puerto Rican noise.

You'll get used to it.

Can I just lay down here
and get a little sleep?

I don't even let the men
I sleep with sleep with me.

I can't get into
your issues right now.

I just need to sleep!

Fine, get in then.

What is that?

Potato chips.
I sleep-eat.

Cool ranch and bacon?

Dude, they're delicious.

Because of your breakup
with Robbie?

Just get in.

I have to be in the city
to babysit in five hours.

Oh, great,
you're like a nightlight.

You're so blonde.

Thank you.

Max, someone's
in the living room.

Max, someone's in the bedroom!

Robbie!

What's up, babe?

Robbie, what are you
doing here?

We broke up.

Still?

Yes, still.
You hit on me.

And then she caught you
with someone else

in these very sheets.

Which I'm hoping she washed.

Oh, I get it.

You blew me off
'cause you like the ladies.

Which is cool.
I like the ladies, too.

And right now,
it's the two ladies I like.

Robbie, if I were
gonna go lesbian,

she would be the last "les"
I'd "bian."

Listen, babe--

You really hurt her.

Stop.

She sleep-eats trans fats
thanks to you.

Here, stuff all of these
in your mouth.

Got it, your thing.
I'll be quiet.

Robbie, this isn't cool at all.

Mm-mm.

Showing up here
after what you did?

You go, girl.

I have something to say to you
and you had better listen.

Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

What are you,
the relationship ghost?

Robbie, just go!

I can't say what I need to in
front of the relationship ghost.

I'll call you
to come get your stuff

and we can talk then.

Leave the key.

Straight up, Max,
you're breaking my heart.

You're the only woman
that I feel this way about.

Here.

Ladies, I don't know
what's going on here,

but it would've been
a lot sexier if I was in it.

Are you okay?

If you wanna talk, I'm here.

Can I get a hit off that?

You think these are good?

God, we're poor.

Morning!

It's a beautiful day.

These shades belong down.

From now on, think of me
as a vampire

without all
the annoying marketing.

Bad news.

A pipe broke in the street
so the water's off.

Good news, when I went out
to get us two coffees,

I spoke to Juan and Javier,
two city workers.

And they assured me the water'll
be on no later than 3:00.

I also stopped
at the health food store

and got us
a fresh-squeezed juice to split.

It's ginger-apple-strawberry.

That was the name of the hooker

who had this apartment
before me.

What is this?

From me.

It says "Thanks for letting me
sleep in your bed last night."

I prefer my usual cash
on the bedside table.

When I went
to the cute coffee place,

I spoke to the counter girl,
Nabulangi--

If someone named Nabulangi
is making an appearance

in the first sentence,
I have to sit down.

And she said
her manager'll be in at 11:00.

So I thought I'd chanel it up,

walk on over there,

introduce myself
and your fabulous cupcakes.

That's exactly what
I was gonna do.

I'm just gonna go say good-bye
to Chestnut and get going.

You know, having
only one cute outfit

takes hours off
getting dressed.

Oh. That is a lot
of fresh Brooklyn.

Morning, Chestnut.

It's a beautiful--

No. Way.

Look, Chanel Number Two.

Tell me it's mud.

T-tell me it's mud.

It's mud?

What is that?

A carrot?

There's carrots in the mud?

There's no water.

Oh, get it off me, please.

Please do something.

Just get it off me,
get it off me.

Stop!

This is dry-clean only.

Max, please, please take me

somewhere they have
a hot shower, I beg of you.

Calm down, it's just mud.

Max, please--

Don't touch me!

Thank you so much
for taking me to shower

at your babysitting job.

Well, I didn't have
much of a choice.

You pulled the pillow knife
on me.

I'll just introduce myself
to your boss

and tell her what happened.

Look, I don't want Peach
to know you were here.

This is a job.
Not a meet-and-greet.

Got it.

You get in there, you
take a five-minute shower,

clean it up and go.

Fine, I'll hide in the hallway
till she's gone.

No need, just follow me in.
She never really looks at me.

Morning!

Hi, Max.

Go!

Hey, Peach.

Uh, hair and makeup.

What's the big occasion?

Pilates.

Max, good news.

They found a way
to make diamonds more sparkly?

I got Brad and Angelina
a playdate

with another set of twins
in the building.

It starts in five minutes.

Cool, what are their names?

6B.

Bye-bye,
Brangelina.

Mommy loves you.

Guys?
Before you leave,

stop at this one.

Angelina could
use a little help.

Contour that neck,
she's a fatty.

Peach, come on,
that's baby fat.

Still, kids can be cruel.

Don't you listen
to your mommy, Angelina.

She never eats.

Oh, no, she doesn't.

Here it is.

Caroline with an "E."

I have your new
and correct nametag.

Oh, thank you, Han.

Oh.

I've seen something
I should not have.

I will just put correct nametag
here on counter.

So sorry, but many thank yous.

What are you doing?

I know you said
you don't want it up there.

But now that you see it...

How does it feel?

It feels like
you're not listening to me

at this job or at my other job.

I said a five-minute shower
and get out.

Did you take a nap at Peach's?

The thread count
was calling to me.

Peach found blonde hairs
in her bed

and thought her husband
was cheating on her.

Which he is,
but that's not the point.

You almost ruined
a perfectly happy fake marriage,

and there are
innocent children involved.

Well, I have some good news.

Look, it's Nabulangi.

I invited her in
to taste your amazing cupcakes.

And when she loves them,
we'll have an in at her bakery.

Come over and say hello.

No, I can't now. I wanna call
Robbie before we get too busy.

Tell him when to come over
and get his stuff.

Max, wait.

No, don't distract me.

I wanna sound cool and hot
and all like,

"You can't have me
anymore, sucka."

Max--

Robbie, it's me.

Classy burp
on your outgoing message.

Max, I--

No.

I need you to come
get your stuff tomorrow.

I don't know how
you've been surviving

without your chin-up bar
and Axe body spray.

Max, hang up.

I already called him.

You called Robbie?

You've done so much for me.

I wanted to do
something for you, too.

So I called Robbie
and I had him come over,

and I gave him his stuff.

Now you won't have to go through
with all that mess.

And I think you'd be pleased,
I really let him have it.

What is with you
and boundaries?

You're in my bed,
you're in my boss' bed,

and now you go and call Robbie?

You're like--
you're like your big-ass horse.

Charging in everywhere
you don't belong.

I thought I was
doing you a favor.

In spite of what you say
about the sounds I heard

coming from your bedroom
the other night,

I know you're upset.

I was masturbating.

I love my job.

I need to see you
outside. Now.

Don't get involved with her.

She takes money
from the homeless.

Not true, Bob's an investor.

Be right back.

Good cupcake, right?

Max, I don't know
how smart that was,

blowing by our only potential
business contact.

You stole my breakup scene.

The only remotely good thing
about breaking up with a guy

is telling him how much better
you are than him

when you give him back
his stuff.

I don't know if you noticed,

but my entertainment budget
is pretty low

and I was really
looking forward to that.

And then you went and stole it.

But I guess
you couldn't help it,

'cause that's what you channings
do, you steal things.

Huh.

Interesting.

Okay, you wanted
a breakup scene?

You're in one.

I'm breaking up with you.

Oh, okay.

The cupcake business is over,
the dream is dead.

Oh, I'm sure Nabulangi
will be devastated.

I don't need you
or your cupcakes to survive.

I'll figure something else out.

Because, aside from your
constant Wharton putdowns,

I'm a business genius

and I will always land
on my feet.

Oh, really?

'Cause today you kind of
landed on your front.

We're done.

After work tonight,
I'll get my things and be gone.

Ooh, you gonna load up
your dream-filled wheelie bag

and ride away
on sir muds-a-lot?

Go ahead.
Be as negative as you want.

'Cause you're in charge
of your own future again.

Oh, joke's on you.
I don't have a future.

Max...

Are you up?

No.

Max, are you mad?

Yes.

Are you up and mad?

No and yes.

Oh, your bed's so soft.

That's my boob.

I know I moved out,
but I came back.

I took the rest
of our dead dream money

and bought some cocktails
for myself and some people.

And myself.

Did you bring me back
any of those?

'Cause I can't
listen to this sober.

Max...

I have nothing.

I really need
the cupcake business.

I can be different.

No, you can't.

No, I can't.

But I can be better.

Please?

Please, let's do this.

I know you have
a fear of success.

You do, because no one
ever believed in your dreams.

But I believe in your dreams.

We have a dream.

God, you are so drunk.

So you probably
won't even remember this.

I'm sorry I said that stuff
about your father.

Did you hear me?

Max, are you up?

Hey, do you have any more
of those poor people chips?

What's up, hangover three?

Why are these up?

I thought we were vampires.

Here, I took the rest
of last night's cupcake money,

and brought you a coffee
and a fresh juice.

Which means that,
after two days in business,

we are $23 down
from where we were.

So we're still building
our cupcake business?

Sure.

All we need is how much?

$250,000.

Which is awesome.

Max, I'm sorry
I crossed all those boundaries.

It's cool.

Me and drunk Caroline
worked it all out.

In fact...

She signed this paper.

"I, drunk Caroline,
am a..."

What's that word?

Punk ass ho.

Thanks.

"I, drunk Caroline,
am a punk ass ho.

"I promise to keep
my big mouth shut,

"and replace all
of Max's poor people chips.

I will no longer meddle
in her relation-chips."

You laughed about that
until you threw up.

Oh, and if you're wondering,

no, the puke stains
will not void this contract.

God!

I forgot again
that we have a horse.

Max, get him out of here.

He doesn't know I'm a waitress.

Chestnut.

He is a champion.

He learned that a lot
faster than you did.

Here's your grilled cheese.

No crust.

Cool.

And can you just move

your coloring materials, sir?

Look.

Pretty.

I was born during the Great Depression,

and I never saw anything as depressing

as that grown-ass white boy coloring

in the damn coloring book.

I was born during a
Def Leppard concert...

And that is the most
depressing thing I've ever seen.

I'm gonna go school him.

Or, in his case, pre-school him.

Max, be gentle.

I think he's in the
middle of his terrible 32s.

Excuse me, OshKosh B'gosh.

I have a question about
your coloring book.

Why?

Oh, they're for adults.

Super Zen.

Super meditative.

Helps with stress.

You know what else helps with stress?

Sex.

And even if someone could get past

those boner-killing overalls...

you ain't gonna have any
of that if you keep this up.

Not to mention, how
stressful can your life

really be if you are carefully
shading a unicorn's ass

at 3:00 p.m. on a Tuesday?

Pickup. Veggie wrap.

Oh, my God, he's having sex.

Oh, Caroline, don't be such a prude.

Oh, good, it's Sophie.

I was worried he was
at that bagel again.

Who says that a pregnant
woman can't have sex

on the kitchen floor of a diner?

The Health Department, Sophie.

Oh boy, sex makes me thirsty.

She just blew right past those cups.

Sophie, having sex with you pregnant

is even hotter than having
sex when you had the bird flu.

Yeah, well, you know,
I'm just as sweaty,

but I sneeze less.

Sophie, you're really not letting

this pregnancy slow you down.

You've already had more sex just today

than Caroline's had all year.

You're not even in maternity clothes.

Yeah.

Well, I don't need to wear one
of those frumpy potato sacks.

Yeah, because I'm a hot potato!

Oh.

Earl, what are you looking at?

I have no idea.

All right, Max...

It's time to have that

uncomfortable conversation again.

Okay, but I thought you
said it was a hard no

on having sex in front
of the Today Show window?

Oh, come on.

My month here is almost up.

I have to get back to
L.A., and we need a plan.

We have a plan.

I use the NuvaRing I found at
the Burlington Coat Factory.

They really are more than great coats.

Max, let's get real.

Max doesn't like to talk about reality

unless it's reality TV.

Like the Cops New Orleans
episode she was on.

It's the only time Fox
has ever aired a nipple.

Uh, who ordered the Korean boy band?

Uh, can I help you?

Yeah, hi.

I'm looking for Han Lee.

'Bout yay big.

'Bout yay stupid.

You're looking for Han?

Just Han, or are you trying
to collect the whole set?

You kind of look like this
Korean pop star named Bong.

Well, my bong is from Korea.

Uh, Han is not here.

Well, if you see him, just
tell him Hwang came to say,

if he doesn't call me
back, he's got three strikes

and no balls.

Oh, he knows that.

Oh, my God, do you think Han

may be in some sort of trouble?

I'm really worried.

Oh, J. Crew sale!

So, after we pay the painters,
the electrician, the plumber,

and, of course, the
bribes to the inspectors,

we have just enough money
left for what I like to call

a little "cash cush."

If that's cash we use for
kush, I'm excited about it.

We can't spend that money,
so pretend it's not there,

like you do with recycling bins.

Oh, no!

The rats are using our tarp
as their Superdome again!

I'll get the rat mallet!

No, don't get the rat mallet!

It's a talking one, get the gun.

Well, if it isn't Crouching
Loser, Hidden Virgin.

Girls, I'm in a bit of hot water.

What happened, you fell
into a tea cup again?

No, I'm in deep trouble!

You've never been in deep anything.

Well, wait, is that why
those scary-looking guys

came into the diner looking for you

and made some threats?

I remember something about
a strike and no balls.

Something about no balls?

You monsters didn't
get the precise wording

on a threat to my life?

I was a little distracted, Han.

J. Crew claimed to have a 50% off sale,

but then I clicked on the link,
and it was an "up to" 50% sale.

Mostly on men's suiting.

Oh, do send me the link
so I can select the suit

I'll be buried in!

Because you two can't
take a damn message!

All right, Han, what is going on?

Are you really in trouble?

Hey!

What was that?

Help me, strong, big man!

That wasn't gunshots, Han,

it was just a car backfiring.

What's going on?

Well, there's no easy way to say it.

I have a pretty substantial
gambling problem.

But Han, that's almost interesting.

Yeah, and I'm almost history!

In case you weren't following,

I'm in a lot of debt!

Han, my man, I'm here for you.

Tell us what it is.

Poker, ponies, football?

It's...

ladies tennis.

Ladies tennis?

I didn't even know you played tennis.

Yeah, well, it's a vicious sport.

And I lost most of my money
on those Williams sisters.

Never trust a big butt and a smile.

You're telling me!

I thought the bad one was the good one.

How much do you owe these people?

Well, with the initial
debt and the interest,

I'm told it's in the neighborhood

of a black market kidney.

Those are pretty pricey.

I know, I have two of them.

Han, that's fascinating, yet disturbing.

Like when you use a black
light at a Red Roof Inn.

You're like an enigma.

Enigma, please.

Han, how dangerous can Hwang be?

His office is in a karaoke bar.

The only thing he's gonna murder

is the Hall and Oates catalogue.

Han, you have to face this bully.

And this is coming
from your biggest bully.

Now come on, do what I
say, or I'll beat you up.

Here we go.

Oh, I just remembered...
I need to get my sweater.

From my home.

In Korea.

♪ Hey I just met you ♪

♪ And this is crazy ♪

♪ So here's my number ♪

♪ Oh, so call me maybe ♪

♪ And all the other girls ♪

♪ But here's my number ♪

Boom.

He looks busy.

Let's revisit this in September.

Oh, I see we have company.

Come in, sit down, give me my money.

Look, Mr. Hwang.

We understand Han has a
weakness for pleated white skirts

and over-developed thighs.

Slow down, let me handle this.

I have experience with
hardened criminals.

First off, killer Carly Rae Jeps.

Um, do you mind if a sister
does, like, five shots?

Look, Mr. Hwang.

Call me by my first name: Hwang.

Your names is Hwang Hwang?

Oh, you think that's funny?

So did Kim.

Kim, show them your mangled genitals.

We're all set, mangled genitals-wise.

Speak for yourself, I'd take
a peek at them mangled gennies.

Uh, perhaps we could put
an installment plan in place

for the money Han owes you?

How much is it, exactly?

$30,000.

On ladies tennis?

I'm sure we can figure this out.

Yeah, I have a free
pass to any AMC Theatre.

I should warn you, though,
it does exclude the IMAX.

Keep it, Han.

I've decided to give you a
little time to pay me back.

That is so cool of you.

How much time?

Uh, one song.

Right now.

And Han?

You better make it a toe-tapper.

'Cause when you're done,

you'll have one less toe to tap.

You're not really
gonna take off his toes.

Kim, show him your missing toes.

Come on, Han, it's show time.

I mean, "toe time."

Oh, my God, this is like
when they make people sing

on American Idol after
they've been voted off.

Hwang, what are you
gonna do with another toe?

I mean, you think you need another one,

and then they just sit on the shelf.

If I don't take his toes,
then I'm known as the guy

who says he's gonna take toes
and then doesn't take toes.

Uh, can I peruse a song book?

It might take a while, I'm very picky.

ABBA...

AC/DC...

Adele...

I already picked you a song.

"Last Dance" by Donna Summer.

'Cause when that toe is gone,

it'll be the last time you dance.

Sing.

♪ Oh ♪

♪ Oh ♪

♪ Last dance ♪

♪ Last chance for love ♪

♪ Yes it's my last chance ♪

♪ For romance ♪

♪ Tonight ♪

♪ I need you ♪

♪ By me ♪

♪ Beside me ♪

♪ To guide me ♪

What are we gonna do?

You heard Han.

He needs us by him,
beside him, to guide him!

Should we go and get the cops?

No, by the time they get back,

Han will have one less toe,
if Hwang even stops there.

What if he takes his whole foot?

Han needs all the height he can get.

Didn't you say something about
us having a money cushion?

We can't use the cushion.

We need it for the dessert bar
in case we have a slow start.

Like we have had with every
business we've started before.

You sure? 'Cause...

♪ Don't leave ♪

♪ Scold me ♪

♪ 'Cause when I'm bad ♪

♪ I'm so so bad ♪

Leaning towards helping.

Han is annoying, nerdy, bad at sports,

but he gave us a cushion
when we didn't have anything.

Max, I want to help Han,
but I also don't want us

to wind up with nothing.

Again.

Let me see him one more time.

♪ So let's dance ♪

♪ Let's dance ♪

♪ Let's dance ♪

♪ The last dance ♪

Can I start over?

I had a bubble in my throat.

Chestnut, we have big news.

And something called mochi.

In here.

I let myself in.

Chestnut can talk?

Thank you, God!

What's up, good looking?

I still can't believe

you're dating someone
who looks like that,

and can read.

Randy, you will not believe what we did.

We saved Han's life.

Well, not his life, so much as his toe,

but still an amazing
gesture on our part.

Well...

long story about a short guy,

we bought the diner.

I had to get something out of it.

I mean, I'm not Mother Teresa.

You bought the diner?

The diner that doesn't
show up on Google Maps

for legal reasons?

That diner?

Why would you do that?

Well, not bought, exactly.

We got Han out of debt in
exchange for part ownership.

It's like, we spend five years
trying to get out of hell,

and then... we bought hell!

Crazy, right?

Yeah, no, real crazy.

When I think of impulse
buys, I think of Altoids

or a flashlight keychain.

Well, I guess congratulations.

Wait, what is that look on your face?

I've never seen it before.

Are you mad?

Just surprised you didn't think

to talk to me about it first.

What, every time I buy a
diner, I have to tell you?

I go back to L.A. in three days.

You couldn't make a plan for that,

but you bought the diner?

That's a commitment.

Now it's done.

I should go tell Chestnut what we did.

'Cause he is gonna laugh.

I know what'll make this all okay.

Some jug snugs?

Yours, not mine.

Nothing?

Well, if we're not gonna do it,

at least put on a shirt.

I am human.

You really think you're
gonna have time for us?

Starting a new business
and owning the diner?

Yes!

I had four jobs in sixth grade,

and I still had time to follow
Smash Mouth around the country.

Not the band, a meth
head my mom really liked.

Chestnut had a big reaction
to the news, as well.

Where's the poop shovel?

Hey, boss ladies, congratulations!

I heard that you own the diner now.

Which is why I am doing double doobies.

Part! Part owners!

I'm still the boss.

Put that away!

Doobie continued.

Who's the boss, Tiny Danza?

Well, I will be again,
as soon as I scrape up

the money to pay you back.

But don't worry, from now on,

I'm not gambling on anything
but lunch at Chipotle.

Hey, everybody!

Sophie's back and better than ever!

Like racism in America.

I heard that.

Wow, Sophie, that is some dress.

And there must be one very
cold leopard out there.

Oh, I like your style, baby.

I realized

I don't need to wear those
basic bitch maternity clothes.

I can be maternal without
losing that little whisper

that says, "I'm doable."

Yes, you are.

She also made a maternity
item for the bedroom.

It's called "The Pregligé."

Hey, Oleg.

Meet me in the bathroom.

Hey, Earl, I'm heading out.

I guess we'll never get to
do that Lethal Weapon reboot

we talked about.

That's all right, I'm doing
a Rush Hour reboot with Han.

What're you doing with that luggage?

Did I get you kicked
out of another hotel?

No, I changed my ticket.

Going back to L.A. today.

But that's today.

And that is a ticket to Los Angeles.

Use it whenever you
want and I'll be there.

This is empty.

Yeah, everything's done online now.

I just did that for effect.

You'll get an email.

Good luck with your
dessert bar and the diner.

I'm gonna see you.

Yeah.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Why are you being so good-bye-y?

I'm gonna visit as soon
as things get settled here.

And we'll talk every day.

I'm even better at phone
sex than I am at real sex.

I find that hard to believe.

It's the only thing on my
resumé that's not a lie.

I'll figure it out. We'll make a plan.

I know you think that.

But I think I was right the first time.

Long-distance relationships don't work.

And I think the real distance between us

is where we are in our lives.

What distance?

I'm three inches away from you.

You better get back to your diner.

I love you, Max.

I love you, too.

Okay, that felt really good-bye-y.

I'm okay, Earl.

This is for me.

I know this is really hard,
but you don't know where

this all is gonna end up.

Like you, when you ride
the subway on ecstasy.

Are you okay?

I am the opposite of okay.

You know, as the boss, I
could let you take a break.

I mean, ten minutes, tops.

If I give you more than ten minutes,

then I'll be known as the girl who says

she's gonna give ten minutes,

then doesn't give ten minutes.

I need to talk to the owner.

That's me!

Oh, that was really painful.

And probably worse than losing a toe.

Hi, it's been 20 minutes.
Have you decided?

Uh, we still need more time,
can you come back?

Sure. And I'm back.

Come on guys you're not buying a house.
Everything sucks.

Pick the thing that sucks the least,
and put it in you mouth.

Max, everyone keeps telling me
they can't decide,

it's like a support group
for bi-sexuals.

Something very magical
about to happen...

Please let it be
the rapture.

I need a day off.

In two minutes,
something very hip is happening.

If you have a camera,

make sure the flash
is on.

Why is he speaking
like that?

Wait a minute.

No one's ordering.

People keep checking the time
on their phones.

Everyone's wearing
matching new balance sneakers.

Flash mob!

♪ Party rockers
in the house tonight ♪

♪ whoo!
Everybody just... ♪

Oh, hell, no!

Caroline, Earl,
code red!

♪ Make you lose your mind ♪

♪ everybody just
have a good time ♪

♪ let's go ♪

♪ party rockers in the... ♪

I couldn't stop disco,
but I'll be damned

if any more of that crap
gets by me.

Why is flash mob over?

Flash mobs were over
a year ago.

Nobody told Han!

I want so bad to be hip.

Start by
never saying that again.

Hello?

Max, phone!

No!

What are you doing?

Only two people
call the wall...

collection agencies

and the landlord, looking
for the original tenant

whose name is on the lease!

- Hang up. Quick!
- Too late.

I've got to man up
and face it.

Hello?

This is what collection agency?

No, my granddaughter Max
is not here.

She died.

On her deathbed,
she said it was the stress

of being constantly harassed
by creditors.

That's juvenile.

Give me the phone.

Hi.
So sorry about that.

What's the issue exactly?

Well, I'm sure
she has every intention...

mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Oh.

Well, you're a doody head.

Never answer the wall.

But what are you
gonna do about it?

You can't just keep lying
to collection agencies.

You have to pay your bills.
I have a system.

I pay everyone
five dollars a week...

just enough to keep them
from freaking out.

It's the methadone-clinic
banking system.

That is a complete waste
of money.

Five dollars won't even cover
the interest you're accruing.

What's the interest rate
on your credit card?

Don't know,
but my interest rate

in the conversation is zero.

Max, how could you
not know that?

That's one of the first things

my father taught me
about finance.

Where...
at Embezzle U.?

Max, I interned
at Merrill Lynch.

Let me help you with this.
It's the least I can do.

I had nowhere to go.
You took me in.

Let me repay my debt to you
by helping with your debt

to everyone in the world,
apparently.

If you keep talking,

I'm going to
Merrill Lynch myself.

I'm one of those people

who gets off on untangling
big, complicated messes.

And since you won't let me
do your hair,

let me do your bills.

You want to do my bills?

Here's my portfolio.

And, uh, if you find
chocolate sprinkles in there,

they're not chocolate...

Or sprinkles.

Okay.

I've divided your bills
into three categories...

"impossible,"
"next to impossible,"

and "how the hell
did that happen?"

And I've divided my roommate
into three categories...

"annoying,"
"super annoying,"

and "how the hell
did that happen?"

I'm closing kitchen
in ten minutes.

I cannot stay later.

I have date with new woman
in my life.

She's very special to me.

I think she may be the one.

You are both welcome
to come watch us have sex.

Just putting it out there.

Just put it back in there.

I'm so excited, I don't even
know where to start.

Drumroll, please.

No?
Okay.

Oh, interesting.

Here we have a bill
from the pet castle,

yet you don't have a pet, and
you've never been to a castle...

Oh, except white castle.

You used a credit card
at white castle?

Yep.
That was good weed.

And the pet thing was
'cause I found a stray

and had to have her
cleaned up

before I could get anyone
to take her.

That would also explain
the charge for neutering.

Nah, actually,
that was for me.

Can't have any more
of these coming out.

Do you really think

it's fiscally smart
to be taking in strays?

Good point.
Move out tonight.

What is this...
a student loan?

Oh, my God.
Max, you went to college?

That wasn't a judgment.
It was just shocking...

kind of like seeing
a baby smoke on the Internet.

I love that kid.

Max, a student loan is
the worst bill you can ignore.

It can never be expunged.

We're breaking out "expunged"
on a weeknight?

You can't run away
from this bill.

I can run away
from anything.

I'm on my fifth identity.

It's just like that
but underwater!

Guys!

Sorry,
we're just closing, guys.

I'll take them, Max.
We need the...

uh, sit anywhere.

What was that roadrunner move
you just pulled?

There's still a smoke outline
of your body

Hanging in the air
out there.

Did Wile E. Coyote
just come in the diner?

- No, but my ex-boyfriend did.

Meep, meep.

Why is William
in Brooklyn?

Why is William
in this diner?

Why is every inbred rich guy
named William?

I don't want to see him.

Max, close the door.

I don't want him
to come in here.

Yeah, 'cause that happens
all the time.

Customers come
in the front door

and make a beeline
through the kitchen

to see if there's a waitress
hiding in the walk-in freezer.

Okay, what is the deal?

Tell me fast.

I'm nipping
like crazy in here.

Ooh, you're smuggling some
gumdrops there, too, ice queen.

His name is William Van Horn,
and he's...

I am leaving for sex.

Last chance for threesome,
foursome, possibly fivesome,

if her sister's train
gets in on time.

Oleg, please.

I don't have time
to be harassed right now.

Oh, okay.

I'll see you
and the gumdrops tomorrow.

Story. Go.

We met
at our parents' companies'

parent company picnic.

His family is
the Boston Van Horns...

story.
Stop.

Cut to the end.
Do we hate him?

He dumped me
when I lost all my money...

never called me,
not an email, nothing.

Oh, we hate him.

Wait. Which one's your ex...
the Asian one, the black one?

I'm kidding.
No, seriously.

The white one or the really,
really white one?

Really, really white.

Service, service, service,

service, service, serv...

you heard your bro.
Service him.

Oh, crushed!

Hey, you better be careful,

'cause I can give you a run
for your money.

I don't have any money.

Well, with a body like that,
you don't need any.

- Oh! Ba-bam!

Did you actually think
that was a good line,

or is that what you do

so the check gets paid
by Richie Rich?

Hold on.
Who said I was rich?

- Let me see your Hands.
- What...

looking to see if I have
poor-people calluses?

No, I wanted to see
how big your penis is.

With Hands that size,
you better be rich.

Oh! Shazam!

Not cool, bro.

- What's your name?
- Michelle Obama.

We're closed.

I'm William.
Give me your number.

Why? So you can put it
in your phone

and never call or text
or email?

Seriously.

You wouldn't know what to do
with a good girl if you had one.

But you're not a good girl.
That's why I want your number.

So how about it?

We're closed.

- Your sign says
"open till 2:00."

My, my.

How time does fly.

2:00, gentlemen...
nighty night.

What did I ever do to you?

You didn't mention me,
did you?

Ugh, no.
I just gave him...

just get to the end.
Do you hate him?

I hate him.

That was
the weirdest thing,

seeing him come in here.

No, the weirdest thing
is coming in here right now.

Why no?

Girl at urban outfitter said
it was hip.

You look like a lesbian

I made out with once
on a dare.

Han, you're adorable
exactly as you are.

Why are you trying
to be hip?

To meet girls.

Oh!

It's not that bad in here.

I thought my first trip
to a laundromat

would be
a lot more depressing.

Six years
we spent together,

and now he won't even look
at me.

Oh, not the bag.

I just looked at his bag...
now yours?

Max, it's driving me crazy.

What did you major in
in college?

I majored
in changing topics.

So what did you ever see
in your ex,

the lost Winklevoss twin?

We're not talking
about William.

We're talking
about your bills.

Well, I'm talking
about your Bill!

Oh, face!
Max...

We're trying to start
a cupcake business.

And I can't believe
I'm about to say this

but with my father's
financial baggage,

you're our best chance
for credit.

Listen, everybody's broke
in their 20s.

And everybody hides
from stuff.

You run into freezers.

I practice ignorance
and blackout drinking.

What's happening right now?

Hola, dudarinos.

The laundromat's
closing early.

We've rented it out
for our '80s pop-up disco party.

Bobby.

- Shouldn't it be called
an "'80s pop-up lame hipster

will do anything
to be ironic and lame" party?

"Lame"?

Don't think so.

What?

Vicki from small wonder
is coming?

Oh!

Embarrassed to be you
right now.

Unless you chicks have
75 disco-lovin' bucks,

be gone in ten minutes,

or my man here
will throw you out.

Don't let his tube top
fool you.

Bobby is mad wiry.

I'm wiry.

Small wonder?

Is that the show on TLC

about the little-people
magicians?

No.

It's an '80s sitcom
about this little girl robot

who lives
with a loving family.

A girl robot?

That's totally unbelievable.

No,
that's totally awesome!

The unbelievable part
is the loving family.

I love Vicki.

She had no
emotions and was empty inside.

My role model! We're staying.

$75?
To do what...

stand here
and dance next to...

Guy-girl and girl-guy
over there?

Come on, Chestnut,

go poo-poo
near the hipsters.

Hey, how cool would it be
if we could get

Chess to go poo
on a hipster?

How can
all of those people

have $75 just to dance
at a laundromat?

I've been doing my roots
with white-out.

Hipsters in Williamsburg
will pay for anything

if it makes them feel like
they're in on something new

no one else knows about.

All you need's a gimmick.

Dudes!

Can we ride your horse?

Sure.
100 bucks.

Okay.
I got to go to the ATM.

Wait. Stay right there.
We'll be right back.

Oh, my God.

Max, we are literally looking
our gift horse in the mouth.

We have something that's better
than an '80s disco party.

We have a horse.

If we throw
a big enough party,

charge hipsters
for horse rides,

we could pay off
your student loan!

You'd whore out Chestnut
like that?

Don't you have to get him
hooked on heroin first?

Max, I've got this.

I'm a brilliant event planner.

My sweet 16
was off the chain...

penthouse party,
pink and black theme.

Alanis Morissette sang songs
from jagged little pill.

On my 16th birthday,

my mom took too many
jagged little pills,

and I had to drive her
to the emergency room

to get her stomach pumped.

Was your childhood based
on the novel Push by Sapphire?

I wish!

The theme is
'90s horse party.

It's exactly the kind
of hip event

you're dying to be a part of.

It would happen
after closing,

so it won't affect business.

And all the horse rides
will take place out back.

So no damage will come
to the diner.

But why would I say yes
to giving up my diner

for no cash return?

You might get laid.

Great!

The '90s horse party
is happening on Thursday.

Fantastic.
Any other questions?

Yes.

What exactly is possibility

of percentage of me...

Getting laid?

All I can say is,

with the cute
'90s-themed-clothing incentive

and the trivia contest,

lots of cute hipster girls
will be here looking to...

Get laid!

I will go now
and start to research

American trivia facts
about the 1990s.

You realize we're gonna have
to give him something...

like flash a little boob,
something.

I feel like Han's
more of an ass man.

Good point... 'cause his head
is right there.

Oleg, what's up?

Not enjoying
the '90s horse party?

I thought you said
"'90s whores party."

Now I'm wearing girdle
and deodorant for no reason.

Quite a turnout, Max.

Reminds me of the after-hours
clubs I used to go to,

you know, if all
the cool cats shooting dope

were replaced by sad,
white fools sipping light beer.

Look!

I did research and make myself
a 1990s trivia t-shirt.

"Talk to the Han."

Get it?

"Talk to the Han!"

That actually is cool.

I am hoping
it will help me...

Get laid?

Care to purchase
a tamagotchi

or a 90210-reo cupcake?

We came here wanting
to hate on you chicks hard.

But that horse you got
out back is mad cool.

You bested us,
party beast.

And to that,
I doff my cap.

- How much are the cupcakes?
- $10 each.

Ooh, I doff my cap again,
milady.

Max, look at all this.

We're a success!

I'll tell you
what's not a success...

the plan to get Han
some action.

Look at him over there.

- That's so sad.
- I know.

Go over there
and give him a "Han" job.

William!

Meep, meep.

You realize this is a freezer,
not a panic room, right?

Just go out there

and tear his smug, white ass
a new one.

I can't face him, Max.

Why? He's the one
who didn't call you.

I can't face him
because I'm a waitress.

Last time he saw me,

I was a billionaire
in a townhouse.

Now I'm a waitress
in a walk-in freezer.

So, when you were laying
around on your trust fund,

doing nothing every day,

having other people
scrub your toilet,

you could hold your head
up high?

But now
that you support yourself

by earning your own money,
that's somehow shameful?

Who cares what he thinks?

He is the guy who just paid $100
to party with a horse.

He's the loser, not you.

Really? 'Cause he's
out there having fun,

and I'm in here,

hugging a tub
of expired blue cheese.

Look...

You see that wad
of cash in your Hand?

You earned that.

Slap that wad in your palm
a few times!

Feel its power.

That's all you got?

Come on,
really squeeze that wad!

Feels good
in your Hands, right?

- Feels pretty good.
- Yeah.

Now slap it and say,
"this is my wad!"

This is my wad.

This is my wad!

This is my wad!

Go out there.

I'm going out there!

As soon as the ladies
calm down.

Are you kidding?

Show him what he's missing.
Let 'em pop, playa!

Where are you,
you rich poseur?

Oh! Uh...

Listen up!

That was meant exclusively
for one specific rich poseur.

All you other rich poseurs,

just continue
with the '90s!

Whoop, whoop!

Where is he?
Do you see him?

Uh, no.
He was right over there.

He's gone.

I don't get to shove this
in his face.

It would've been nice
to put my wad

in his face
for a change.

Oh, speaking of wads,
look over there.

Aw.

He's such a little pimp.

Are you okay?

Yeah.
Actually, I am.

I guess I didn't need
to go over there

and make some big,
dramatic speech,

telling him
that even though I'm a waitress,

I'm better than him.

I know that now.
Thank you.

And when I see him
one day in the future,

I'll be happy
to tell him that.

He just came
out of the men's room.

Let's get out of here!

What? I thought
you wanted to talk to him!

I said, "the future."
This is the '90s.

Let's get out of here.
Run!

Feels good running away
from your bill, huh?

So great.

See, that's what
I've been saying.

Well, at least
you don't have to run

from your student loan bill.

We can pay that off and still
have $50 for the cupcake fund.

I hate that college won.

Didn't you get anything
out of it?

You mean, besides mono
and an art teacher

whose idea
of finger-painting

was a little more "finger"
than "painting"?

Art teacher?

Max, was that your major... art?

Keep your eyes on the road.
You're driving.

I just thought
for, like, a second,

I could maybe illustrate
children's books.

Max, that's so sweet.

You're not like Vicki at all.

Max, look.
Han!

Aw, our little
somethin'-somethin'

got him a little
somethin'-somethin'!

I doff my cap, milady!

Max, guess what Han's doing
at the counter?

Well, I know it's not
towering over it.

He's creating signature drinks
for the diner.

I suggested any household poison
over shaved ice.

Han, this is a stupid idea.

It was Earl's.

Then it's genius.

Yep, I've been drinking
all afternoon for free.

Now, I've used only
top shelf liquor.

Question: Who got it down
for you?

First up: "The Max".
It's just whiskey.

On the rocks, like Max's job.

Whatever mine is,
I want my rim salted.

Of course you do.

Earl's is an Old Fashioned
with everything.

Pour me another me.

I hate to say it,
but I go down easy.

"The Caroline" is Lemon Schnapps
in a slightly frosty glass.

Because of my cool,
Grace Kelly kind of demeanor?

No, because they had a sale
on Lemon Schnapps

at Beverage Barn

Oh, they don't card there?

Okay, so what's "The Han"?

A No Sex on the Beach?

Mine is a classic martini,
shaken.

Oh, like the first woman
who saw you naked.

Correction.

Will see you naked.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

Max, guess what happened
when you were running

to the bathroom real quick,
for two hours.

You worked the cupcake window
while I went

to see The Statue
of Liberty.

Her head was being
renovated.

Everybody in this town
is getting work done.

I sold our last cupcake tee!

We've sold out more than
Robert De Niro

in the last 20 years
of his career.

Well, analyze this, Focker.

I noticed we were running low
last week,

so I ordered more.

How did I not notice
those sooner?

Oh, probably because
the last time I looked in there,

there was a rat having sex
with a cockroach.

You know, they're still dating.

Really? I thought
it was a one time thing.

Well, I guess once you go
rat, you never go back.

Thanks for ordering these,
I've just been so busy

with Sophie's wedding shower.

Yeah, why are you working
so hard?

It's not a big deal.

I threw my mother
a shower once.

No wait, I threw her
in a shower once.

Max, you really need to start
making more of a fuss.

It's for Sophie,
it means a lot to her,

and she has a gun.

Well, showers are stupid
girl things

that this guy
wants no part of.

Hey, girls!

Look. I'm advertising
your cupcake business.

You're advertising something,
but it's not our cupcakes.

I gave out free T-shirts
to our building.

I left one
by everyone's door.

Two at Sophie's,
16 at the Sanchez's.

So about six of the kids
will have to share.

Interesting. Now our shirts
are available at both Rodney,

the high-end Manhattan
boutique,

and an apartment
building that always smells

a little like gasoline.

Well, please stop talking about
things that aren't me.

Now girls,
did you get the cake

for my wedding shower
tomorrow?

Oh, was I supposed
to make a cake?

I've literally done
nothing for this shower.

I haven't even taken a bath.

Oh, no, I'm not getting my cake
from here.

No, this is my bridal shower.

Yeah, I want to get something
classic from Baskin Robbins

that's also a Dunkin' Donuts.

They mix those two now?

It's a stoner's dream come true.

I tried to make our apartment
look nice.

I even moved a chair
to cover a stain,

but what was under the chair
was so much worse.

I guess what I'm saying is,
please don't shoot us.

Well, I don't expect it
to look that good.

I mean, you can't put
a silk hat on a pig.

And I know,
'cause I tried once.

[gags]

[gags]

Max! Oh, my God!
What have you done?

I realized I don't like
a strawberry center.

And I am not going to beat
myself up about it.

When I told you
to get crepe paper streamers

and decorate for the shower,
I meant with pink, not black.

It's a wedding shower
for Sophie,

not a baby shower
for Rosemary's Baby.

What? I told you,
I don't do girl things.

Like hang pink
or sit when I pee.

Which, coincidentally,
I refer to as "hanging pink."

My God, what is that smell?

Something's really gone
bad here.

Besides our lives.

It's the Polish food.

I think one of those sausages
is made of old flip-flops.

[knock at door]

Someone's here already?

Are Polish people always early?

Is that a stereotype
I don't know about?

Oh my God!

A wedding shower for me?

I mean, if I had known,
I would have dressed!

Sophie, you did know.

I know. I came down early
to practice some entrances.

Now get ready for entrance
number two.

Are you ever ready
for entrance number two?

[knock at door]

Who is it?

[fakes weeping]

Oh my God!

I can't believe it.

Oh, it's the day
of my wedding shower.

Could anything be
more wonderful?

I was moved,
I was surprised.

I liked it better
than the book.

Now, come on in here
and identify some of this

Polish food so I can know
what I'm not eating tonight.

Oh, no.
I'm not eating at my shower.

I'm pretending
I have an eating disorder

so everyone will think
that I have it all.

I think you're going to be
happy.

I have lots
of fun shower games,

starting with "Who Knows
The Most About Sophie?"

Oh, I'll win that one.

Yeah.

And Sophie's got to tinkle.

See?
I'm a shoo-in.

Yeah.
Oh. Oh, my gosh.

Black toilet paper.

Oh, nice touch, girls.

Yeah, I love the mystery
of not knowing when you're done.

[knock at door]

(Agent Drake)
FBI! Open up!

The FBI?
I don't think they RSVP'd.

Oh, that's got to be for me.

I didn't do it.

And just so you know,
the statute of limitations is up

on that Newark thing.

I'm not here to arrest you,
miss.

Great, it's me.

Max, I told you pirating movies
was a real crime.

Now I'm going to jail
for Fifty Shades Of Grey.

Someone should.

I hear you,
not the Christian Grey

I'd pictured.

I'm Agent Drake with the FBI.

Nothing to get upset about, but
there's a man in your building

who's been holding
three women hostage

in his apartment for months.

Yeah, that sounds about right.

Now, one of the captives
escaped today

and alerted authorities.

Oh, that must have been
the lady I passed

screaming in the hall.

What? There is a fine line
between "hostage"

and "off your meds"
in this building.

So, a SWAT team
is going in

for the other two
still upstairs.

But we need to evacuate
the building first.

So let's go.

All right, can I just put
a few things away first.

You know, because I want
the place to look nice

if there's going to be
police in here.

Look, miss, whatever drugs
you're hiding in here,

I couldn't care less.

We need to get out now.

You know,
you're just my type of guy.

You don't mind my drug use
and you're already here.

Oh, yeah!

You girls ordered a cop stripper
for my bridal shower?

Oh, here comes
the bride all right! Yeah!

Come on.
Yeah.

Yeah, see?
Look, he likes me.

I cannot believe
I live in this building

with a man who would do
something so awful.

Also, cannot believe
I live in this building.

You know who I think it is?

Smells Like Cats
But Has No Cats.

Really? He doesn't seem
like a go-getter.

I think it's Three Nipples
No Nose.

Three Nipples No Nose?
He's a delight.

Sophie, isn't this upsetting?

It sure is.

I couldn't get that stripper cop
to take his pants off.

Hey, look, there's some
of my shower guests.

Oh, look.

And see?
That one's my friend Natalya.

The one I told you about.

Yeah, there's all that
extra skin.

Ew.
You were not exaggerating.

She was born
with all that skin.

She had a chip clip
on her back

all through high school.

Yeah, I know that guy upstairs
is a real bummer,

but you know what would help?

If I could open my presents.

Yeah.

(Sophie)
Oh, no!

The fuzz isn't letting them
through!

Oh, come on.

No fair, they just let a guy
in here a few minutes ago.

Just 'cause your friends
aren't bomb-sniffing dogs,

they can't get in?
Boo!

Hey, look, ladies, pass
your presents up to the cops.

Cops, pass my presents to me.

Wait, Sophie,
before you open them,

I really want to write down
who got you what.

And save that pretty ribbon,
I'm gonna make you a bow hat!

Look at you.

Making lemonade
out of a maniac

holding three innocent women
hostage.

(Sophie)
Oh, a gift card.

Oh, send it back.

Sophie, we would've taken that.

I don't know what is was for,

I just know that we would've
taken it.

No, I'm sending it back.

I want a gift,
not another errand.

Oh, yeah, not in love
with the paper, but...

well, I'll wait till
I open it to judge.

(Maria)
Hi.
Excuse me.

Excuse me?

I'm Maria Alonso-Gonzalez.

Could you ladies talk
to Channel 2

about tonight's disturbing
discovery?

- No.
- Yes.

Just go with me
and my business savvy.

Yes, Maria Alonso-Gonzalez,
we can answer a few questions.

Were there any signs at all
that something of this nature

was going on in your building?

We jut hope they bring
this sick freak

in our building to justice
so that we can return to work

at Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

(Maria)
Get on the door.
Here he comes.

Who is it?
Who is this sick freak?

It's not me.

Is it?

I'm not sure,
what are the charges?

Different sick freak.

Hey, Rula, Uma, Greta, look.

(Sophie)
This is him.

This is the groom-to-be.

Forget about the guy upstairs,

this is the real maniac
in the bedroom.

[gasping]

That's him?

Beer Belly Gym Shorts?

- Never would've guessed.
- Oh, no.

(Caroline)
He's wearing one of our shirts.

Why?

Why? Why is he wearing
a medium?

Oh...

I mean, nobody's gonna see that.

(Maria)
Police have just apprehended
the suspect

and the question on
everyone's mind is,

"What does Max's Homemade
Cupcakes

have to do with this?"

We have no comment.

Or future, or deodorant.

So leave us alone!

How did they find out we work
in this dump,

next door to the other dump?

As I'm saying it,
I realize our career

is made up of two dumps.

Sounds like our career has been
drinking too much coffee.

The story is all over the paper.

They're calling those ladies
"The Cupcake Captives,"

calling that guy
"The Cupcake Captor,"

and calling the whole thing
"The Cupcake Catastrophe."

But you needn't worry about it
reflecting badly

on your cupcake business.

Oh, no. It's even
in the fashion section.

There's a picture
of our shirts and it says,

"What not to wear, ever."

Okay. Everybody calm down.

I'm mostly talking to myself.

The media is just going
to do its thing.

I've been slandered
in the headlines before.

I was called "Ponzi Princess,"
"Bankrupt Barbie."

Looking back,
those were the best of times.

Oh, hello.
I was just about to take a tray

of Max and Carolines
out to my reporter friends.

Sorry, you can give those
Max and Carolines

to this Max and Caroline.

Hi, everybody.

Oh, I'm depressed.

See, you can tell 'cause
I'm only wearing half my hair.

Girls, I found this box
outside your door.

And I was hoping
it was a shower present.

Since those selfish hostage
girls ruined my special day.

Oh, man. I didn't
even get a freakin' ribbon hat.

Do you want the tube top
I made out of the police tape?

I'm calling it a tape top.

Patent pending.

Come on, you guys.

This isn't about us.

We need to put this
all in perspective.

We're all safe,
and healthy, and--

Oh, my God, just when
I can't take anymore,

here comes anymore.

"We are returning the remainder
of your t-shirt stock.

"Our Rodney brand cannot be
associated with a product

"at the center of an ongoing
criminal investigation.

Consider our contract
null and void."

This is so shocking.

Max, you can read?

So you just didn't want to tell
people the specials.

I can't believe this.

We waited so long
for something to happen

to our cupcake t-shirts.

Why that guy?

And on the one day
he chooses to not wear

his "Pull my finger" shirt.

(Maria)
This is Maria Alonso-Gonzalez,
reporting to you live...

Max, what are you doing?
They'll see us.

- from Max's Homemade Cupcakes.
- No they won't,

Because call the cameras
are on Han right now.

Can you talk a little bit
about the women

behind
Max's Homemade Cupcakes?

Well, let's just say
Max and Caroline

are allergic to work,
much in the same way

Dilbert is allergic
to Mondays.

[laughs]

Moving on,
Maria Alonso-Gonzalez,

would you care to come into
The Williamsburg Diner,

6355 Bedford Avenue,

open 8:00 A.M. till 2:00 A.M.,

for our signature drink:
The Cupcake Captive Cosmo?

And for you gents,
The Captive Cape Cod?

Hey, get these cupcakes
out of the garbage.

I need to make room
for Han's body.

I'm keeping the head as a
warning to others who cross us.

We need to take back
our t-shirts' image

by setting up an interview
with the news.

And by "we," I mean you.

Look, if I learned one thing
from my time on Cops,

it's that I can hop a fence
in three seconds flat.

If I learned two things,
it's that the camera

makes me look guilty.

Especially when it's a security
camera at Banana Republic.

I can't do it.

The world can't know
that Caroline Channing

is involved in another
high-profile crime.

And hasn't kept up her nail
maintenance, like, at all.

Fine.

Because if I learned
three things from Cops,

it's that it's best to surrender
early and not naked.

We really appreciate you
taking the time to talk to us.

If you really
want to thank me,

how about I get some pixels
up over my grill?

I got some kids looking for me
and they don't need the help.

We don't have the capability
to do that.

This is live TV.

How about one of those
voice distorting machines?

You know, make my voice sound
like a fat Transformer.

Um, no.

No problem.

I'll take care of that myself.

Been in this sitch before.

All right, in 3, 2...

Good evening.
In Williamsburg...

Max, I'm right here,
if you need me.

I got this.

Now infamous in the shocking
"Cupcake Captives" story.

I'm here with the owner,
Max Black.

[distorted]
Hi, Maria.

Max, how upset were you to see
that Richard Griffin

was Max's Homemade Cupcakes'
biggest fan?

[distorted]
I was really upset.

Okay, hi.
Stepping in.

Max is clearly so upset
by all this

that she's lost her mind.

The one time
I really needed her, anyway.

Hi, Maria.

How will your company's
reputation recover

from doing business
with a man

who held three women in his
apartment against their will?

Look, people
do terrible things.

And they do them
wearing shirts.

That doesn't make
the shirt evil.

Now, if a shirt
commits a crime, lock it up.

You'll get
no argument from me.

[distorted]
Should I jump back in?

Okay, yeah.
That's all the time we have.

- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

[distorted]
Thank you.

Caroline, thank you
for trying to throw me a shower.

I mean, we were
never really friends or close.

And yeah, I run away when
I see you heading towards

the mailboxes the same time
as me--

Please stop thanking me.

Hey. Want to come
to our place?

Those pig feet
haven't gone bad.

I guess.
It's hard to tell.

Yeah. The best meat's
under the toe nails.

Is it?

(all)
Surprise.

[shouting]

Oh, my God, what's all this?

Oh, no.
I'm so surprised.

No, I really am this time.

- So am I.
- Me, too.

Until this sausage,
I thought the grossest thing

I'd ever eaten was kale.

Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

Could anything be
more wonderful?

[laughs]

Max, I can't believe
you did all this.

I thought you came home
to do what you usually do

when you get depressed.

Get drunk and throw the finger
at people from the stoop.

No stoop.
But I am drunk.

You think I could've
done this sober?

I just figured, with everything
around us being so black lately,

I thought we needed
a little pink.

You're right. We did.

'Cause our t-shirt business
is over.

And we still have to pay off
that bank loan. Now what?

We'll figure something out.
We always do.

Hey, girls, come quick.

We're gonna play "Guess Sophie's
Favorite Sex Position"

(all)
Whoo!

It's on all fours, watching
How To Get Away With Murder.

See?
I told you I was gonna win.

And it just got black again.

Yeah, real black.

This is wet!

Max, did you already eat this?

I told you, I don't like
a strawberry center.

And I am not gonna
beat myself up about it.

Pick up. Table ten, table 12, table 69.

Oleg, there is no table 69.

There could be.

Oleg just sixty-nined me,

and now I don't remember
any of the table numbers.

Look, he's never gonna
stop sixty-nining us.

Forget the table numbers.

Here's how you remember your orders.

You just give people nicknames.

Look, I got thin cee lo,

fat rihanna, jon beret ramsey,

and kristen bad wig.

Oh, okay.

I got seth rogaine,

child molester moustache,

and lesbian justin bieber.

- Good.
- Thanks.

Pick up. Table six.

ty-nine.

So can I get you anything else?

Coffee? Dessert? Morning-after pill?

Okay.

Getting it on in a restaurant.

I once made love to a
young angela lansbury

in a booth just like that.

Murder she wrote?

more like "harder she begged."

Earl, why isn't everyone you?

Yo, what's up, mama?

Oh, hey, johnny.

Usual? Two coffees to go?

Yeah, and can I get
two of your cupcakes?

Which two?

You know which two.

The discounted day-olds?

Yeah, girl.

Hey, my bro and friend.

Hey, what's up, big guy?

Max, your boyfriend is here.

'cause who doesn't?

Well, your face gets
red when you see him,

and you suddenly act like nice person.

If that's not love,
I don't know what is.

He doesn't know what love is.

The only thing he ever
loved was a stepladder.

Johnny, here's your stale
cake and burnt coffee.

Just how I like it.
What do I owe you?

It's on me.

You wish it was on you.

There's nothing going on.

He just comes in here to get coffee

because he tags billboards all night.

Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

Listen, renaissance fair,

why don't you be a good wench
and clean up your counter?

Until the cupcake business takes off,

i'm just gonna have to
find a temp job online.

Can I close this window that says
"mexican painkillers"?

Yeah, yeah, but, uh,
bookmark it first.

Here we are. Craigslist. Okay.

How does this job sound?

Disgusting and depraved.

You didn't even hear it yet.

Did I not hear "craigslist"?

Oh. Here's something easy I could do.

A professional organizer.

You're not a professional organizer.

You're barely a professional waitress.

I am a genius at organizing things

and getting them out of the way.

I recently lost all my money and
the promise of a bright future,

and I've organized that
into a file in my head

labeled "do not open
until you are stronger."

If I can handle that for myself,

I can certainly handle a
stranger's light filing.

If I had known all that craziness

was going on in your head,

I would have ordered you
some mexican pain killers.

Or the peruvian.

They're stronger,

but sometimes they make you
lose control of your hands.

Thought that was an ibuprofen.

What is johnny doing
here at 3:00 a. M.?

Thought it was a rapist or something.

Rapists don't knock and wave.

And if they looked like that,
we wouldn't call them rapists.

We'd call them... Johnny!

What are you doing here?

I'm here to talk to you guys

about the church of latter day saints.

And I have to pee.
Can I use your bathroom?

No problem. Don't forget to
tip the bathroom attendant.

What's up, caroline?

Just trying to find a day job

where I won't get
handcuffed to a radiator.

On craigslist?

This is so romantic.

Jumping over the back wall

to drop down and see you
in the middle of the night?

It's very romeo and juliet.

it is very romeo and juliet.

He has to pee,
and I'm the nearest toilet.

Please. That's just an excuse.

The man defaces buildings. And what?

He draws the line at peeing on them?

He came by here to see you.

Pull your hair back.
It's kind of in your face.

Pull yourself back.
You're kind of in my face.

Thanks, guys.

I was tagging a building nearby,

and while I was on the roof

I saw that your light was on,

so I thought I'd stop in and say hey.

- Hey.
- So, johnny,

you just saw our light
on from the roof nearby?

Interesting.

Do you always look down
when you're up that high?

Not really.

Interesting.

Flying solo tonight.
My lookout guy went into rehab.

It's kind of a pain.

It's really a two-person operation.

Ugh, such a bummer when people

can't handle their heroin.

Hey, max, what are you doing
tomorrow night after work?

Any desire to be my lookout guy?

I might have some desire
to be your lookout guy,

but as far as the "guy"
part of "lookout guy" goes,

full disclosure-

What, you don't have a penis?

Oh, I have one.

In a drawer in my bedroom.

If the cops come tomorrow,

I will run like a girl.

Okay. So pick you up
at the diner at 2:00?

- Cool.
- Cool.

Cool.

And then romeo left.

So romantic. All the weeks
of flirting and game playing

have finally led to this-

You two on a late-night roof rendezvous.

Hey, genius organizer,

why don't you put all that
garbage in a file labeled

"I've seen too many
katherine heigl movies"?

I'm just saying, he likes you.

He likes you with his penis.

There. 3f.

All right. You're here.

Goodbye. Go organize.

No, I said you have to wait

until I open the door and
check out if it's safe.

It's my day off.
You're the one with the job.

And you're the one who
freaked me out so much

about going into
a stranger's apartment.

What did I say that was so bad?

You told me he'd cut off my face

and wear it as a party hat.

I said... "probably."

Probably cut off your face.

Nothing bad is gonna
happen to you, okay?

Okay.

It's a safe-enough
looking building, right?

Yes.

Look, they have those
hallway trash chutes.

That's probably how he'll get
rid of your faceless body!

You're right. I'm fine. Go.

Caroline's second job. So proud.

Call me if you freak out or anything.

How am I gonna call you
without a face?

I'm fine. I'm not gonna call you.

Hello, it's caroline,
the professional organizer.

Hello?
Someone called for an organizer?

Hello?

Oh, no. Oh, hell no.

Max, come back!

Hurry up. This is so exciting!

What are you talking about?

I'm not going back in there.

He's a hoarder. A hoarder.

It's a bad reality show.

Hey, that is a great reality show.

but it's not good reality reality.

The only thing I
love more than hoarders

are people who are too
fat to fit through doors.

Tell me the hoarder has
to grease his sides

to get through the door.

You won't have to get
me a birthday present.

Are you kidding me?

They should charge admission for this.

It's hoarders 3d- The experience.

It's like going to an imax.

It's my max!

ooh!

Save yourself. Go on without me.

Oh, god.

What is that pile over there?

It's hard to tell what is what.

It's either a- An old shag carpet

or a mass grave of dead muppets.

No way. Let's get out of here.

We still have our faces.
Why would we leave?

And besides, you need this money.

Look around.

There might be stuff
here they don't want

that we can sell on ebay.

Look. You know someone's
gonna want a fish tank

full of doll heads.

Yeah, someone with a fish
tank full of doll bodies.

Last year I owned a yacht
named the caroliner,

and now I'm considering
selling doll heads on ebay.

I'll be organizing that
thought in a file in my head

labeled "don't open ever."

Okay.

There's a heavy clown
presence in this room.

It's unsettling,
and I'm obsessed with it.

I want both more and less of the clowns.

Um, hello? Anyone here?

Oh, hey, i'm over here.

I'm sorry. Where?

By the papers.

Which papers?

The papers near the papers.

Oh, my god. I love this!

Um, hi. Caroline? We spoke yesterday.

There's a lot more to organize here

than you led me to believe on the phone,

so we're gonna have to
renegotiate our price.

It's not that bad.

Not that bad?

I was hired to organized some papers,

not clean up katrina.

What's he look like?

Please tell me he needs to
be buried in a piano box.

I don't know. I can't
see him through the truck.

It's an rv, and it's a collectible.

It's where I keep my raisins.

So how much more, then?

Um, a hundred a day. For both of us.

And we get to keep the horse
head made out of soda cans.

Why would we want that?

We don't. It's for chestnut.

Every horse wants a
friend made out of cans.

You got a deal.

Okay. We'll get to work then.

Okay. Let's not get overwhelmed.

We'll take it one step at a time.

Let's start small.

Happy birthday to me.

Whoo, max. Well, look at you.

Starting the night at
the end of the night.

This is the first time I've seen you

out of the prison uniform.

You look beautiful.

Oh, earl, let's get married.

What are you staring at?
It's just clothes.

Max, you look like a lady.

Tonight when I dream
of having sex with you,

as always, this time I
will ask you to stay.

Max, you look perfect for your date.

- It's not a date.
- It is.

No, it's not.

It's booty call.

There is a fresh, white billboard.

I'm climbing it with my friend,

and we're putting up his artwork.

Booty call on billboard.

If it's after 2:30,

call is for the dirty.

What's that from?

Dr. Seuss' "oh,
the places you'll put it in"?

Okay, boys, break it up.

Go about your business.
Nothing to see.

Max.

Max and johnny's first date.
So proud.

It's not a date.

Be home at 11:00... a.m.

Uh, max, you got protection?

No, I've got it.

Me too.

Oh, sorry. That is pack of gum.

Can we take these masks off now?

Whoo. It is hot up in that bunny.

Are we wearing these

so no one'll be able to
pick us out of a lineup?

Yeah, that.

And I always wanted to
see a rat with big boobs.

Well, here he is.

All right. Now for the most
crucial part of the art process,

beer break.

That makes sense.

Been here four minutes.

Hmm.

Ooh. Gentleman.

Look over there.
You can see manhattan.

Oh, yeah.

She's a bitch.

Always shoving her stuff in your face.

You can never have it.

Yeah.

I'd never want to live in manhattan.

- 'Cause you can't afford it?
- Yeah.

She is beautiful, though.

Yeah, she is.

Well, we should get back to work.

Bunny's gotta hop.

How many more times
do you need to hear it?

He didn't kiss me.

Maybe it wasn't the right time.

Overlooking the new york skyline,

a hundred feet in the air,
bathed in moonlight?

Yeah, that's a crappy time.

Maybe he didn't want to make a move

because he doesn't know you like him.

I leaned in. I leaned for a kiss.

Maybe you had a breath situation.

What did you eat? What had you eaten?

Nothing.

Okay, but sometimes when
you don't eat, it's worse,

because you start to
grind up your feelings.

Then you get stomach breath.

I wouldn't kiss ryan gosling
with stomach breath.

- Yes, you would.
- Yes, I would.

I'm finally making
progress on the papers.

Oh, no, fdr died of polio.

Oh, look. They cured polio.

Jackpot. This place is
a freakin' cat factory.

And they're alive. How refreshing.

There's, like, 45 kittens in this box,

and I think one of these
kittens just had kittens.

Kittens having kittens.

Hey, douglas, we found some kittens.

Those are not my kittens.

Okay. What about this mountain
of butterfinger wrappers?

those are my wrappers.

I need those.

I haven't even seen him yet.
I love this show.

Douglas, if you're comfortable

with me selling all this
sort-of-valuable stuff on ebay,

why do you need to keep a box
full of butterfinger wrappers?

I don't want to think about it!

See, max?

This is what happens when you
don't deal with your feelings.

You start collecting
butterfinger wrappers,

and next thing you know you're
an old lady in a rest home,

and you're thinking
"why didn't he kiss me?"

why didn't he kiss me?

I don't know.

Why didn't you kiss him?

You obviously like him, right?

Max, stop hoarding your feelings.

Just admit that you like him.

I like him.

Okay, good.

There's one box of
butterfinger wrappers gone.

What?

Douglas, it's a metaphor.

So next time you see him,
why don't you just kiss him?

I don't know if I can kiss him first.

Just kiss him already!

Wait, there's another person in here?

Butt out, ma.

Those are my kittens, young lady.

Hold up. He's hoarding
another hoarder in here?

Awesome.

I can't believe you put

the platypus foot rest in the trash.

On ebay we could get at least
three to six dollars for it.

I'm gonna tell you this one more time.

It's a opossum, and it died at
least three to six years ago.

Oh, my god. There's johnny.

This is a katherine heigl movie.

What are you guys doing
in this neighborhood?

Oh, hello. Sorry to interrupt you,

but what the hell's going on here?

This is, uh...

I'm cassandra, his girlfriend.

Who are you?

I'm max, and, um,
that's how I say hi to everyone.

I'm incredibly friendly.

She's so friendly.

Here's table ten, earl.

Are you okay, max?

Rumor has it that you
had your heart broken.

I didn't have my heart broken.

And that's why I
don't listen to rumors.

Max, I want to announce
I have ended my bromance

with your boyfriend, johnny.

I hate the player as well as the game.

Never was my boyfriend.

I would like to offer
myself for rebound sex.

Or, if not, I can just
beat the crap out of him.

Caroline, did you
have to tell everyone?

I'm sorry, but I'm not
keeping that up in my head.

I'm not going butterfingers.

I can't believe he has a girlfriend.

Are you happy now?

You got me to admit that I like him,

and then you got me to kiss him.

And then I kissed his
beautiful girlfriend,

who is black and british,

the two cool things I can never be.

I'm sorry, but he led you on.

Oh, did he?

I think you and douglas'
mother led me on.

This is not my fault.

He's the one who's hoarding women.

Hi.

Yeah, you must be to come back in here.

Can we talk?

Pick up, max.

Table three, table nine.

Table 69.

Not a good time.

- Max, look...
- Johnny, stop.

You don't need to "max, look" me.

It's cool. You never led me on.

You never put your hands on me.

You never even kissed me.

Food!

Hey, better make sure he
doesn't have a girlfriend

who's beautiful, black, and british.

Max, look, I wanted to kiss you.

I want to kiss you.

I just didn't want to
be the guy who did it

when he's with someone else.

Look, max, I didn't know you
were gonna come into my life.

I didn't know I was gonna
have these feelings for you,

but all of a sudden it's "max"
all the time in my head.

Cassandra and I have or-or had something,

and there is or was love there,

and-and I don't know
what I'm supposed to do

with all my feelings for you.

Johnny, I just spent two days

wading through someone else's garbage,

and, quite frankly,
I don't have the time or the energy

to go through all the
clowns and candy wrappers

you've got going on up in there.

And the next time you invite someone

to a booty call on a billboard...

It wasn't a booty call.

I think everyone knows

if it's after 2:30,
the call is for the dirty.

And p.s., we've known
each other six months,

and you never told me
you had a girlfriend.

You should have worn the rat mask.

And that's all she wrote.

Silver lining time?

We didn't have to change

douglas and his mother's diapers?

We made $240 for the cupcake business

selling all that crap on ebay.

Yup. I made some money,
and all I lost was my mind.

Want to hear something
you don't want to hear?

I think what johnny said
to you was beautiful.

You think a squirrel holding
an acorn is beautiful.

He didn't touch you or kiss you

because he didn't want
to start a relationship

with you out of a lie.

You know what? You're right.

You've been right all along.

It is like romeo and juliet.

And now I'm gonna go
home and kill myself.

I don't think romance
is in the cards for me.

I give guys blue balls,
not broken hearts.

Oh, my god. Don't kill
yourself yet, juliet.

I definitely think
romance is in your cards.

That's not me.

That's not his girlfriend.

Come on, will you at least
admit that that's you

and that he put it up there
because he wanted you to see it?

And that's actually incredibly romantic.

Oh, yeah. That's the
most romantic picture

of a guy who might be kissing someone

who might look like me,

but he didn't because he has
a hot british girlfriend

who seems like kind of a bitch,

but is kind of cooler
than I will ever be.

I dare you to organize that thought.

There's no one cooler than you.

You're 200 feet tall.

Yeah, and a bird
just took a crap on me.

Come on.

Come on.

Max, thanks for agreeing
to get in the spirit

and do holiday cupcakes.

So much better than
last year when you go so drunk

you turned the
12 days of Christmas

into the 12 steps
of Christmas.

Yeah, well, I finally
gave in.

Christmas is like herpes.

No matter what you do,

it's gonna flare up
once a year.

Oh, you made
a Feliz Navidad cupcake.

I'm muy proud of you.

And I think we're going
to make muy mucho moolah

when Manuel comes manana.

You're the only person I know

who seems whiter
speaking Spanish.

Feliz Navidad for our
Spanish speaking friends.

And for kids raised like me,
Feliz "He's-not-your-dad."

And then, "Joy To The World"
for the normals,

and for the hipsters,
"Joint To The World."

For the kids,
"Frosty The Snowman."
- Aww.

And for you,
"Frosty With No Man."

Well, I didn't see Jack Frost
nipping at your nips either.

Oh, here, this one's
my favorite,

"Santa Claus Is Coming"--

Max, stop right there.

No, that was it.
He's coming.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ¶

Earl, change please.

"Earl, change please."

A phrase I heard
from both my ex-wives.

Wow, you have more
Christmas cards

than Oscar Pistorius
had excuses.

What can I say, Max?
I spread a lot of goodwill.

It's also where I get
all of my shirts.

Here you go.
Have a nice holiday.

My two kids love
this time of year.

And next Christmas,
there will be three.

It's a boy.

My husband was so happy when
I called him in Afghanistan.

Man, this time of year
people are easier

than a fat girl
in a tube top.

Oh, great.
We can use this money

to order more
of our cupcake t-shirts.

No, we are using that
to buy people Christmas gifts.

I was really looking forward
to giving someone something

that wouldn't require
the follow-up penicillin shot.

We need more shirts.
These are really selling.

The guy at table four
said it's the perfect gift

for a girl you're not in love
with, just strictly banging.

He bought three.
- Well...

I happen to know
for a fact

that everyone here's
getting us stuff.

Han came in with
a small package today

and also he was carrying
a gift bag.

We'll find some money
for the gifts.

People aren't expecting
anything big.

Happy holidays.

People just got the nothing big
they were expecting.

Gather, please.
I have a very special gift

for all my diner employees.

Health insurance?

Come on, it's Christmastime,
not crazy time.

It's art. It's a one of a kind
silk screen.

I did it by hand.

I figured that's how
you always have to do it.

Han, it's the diner.
This is amazing.

Open the door.
I put something behind it

that reminds me
of each of you.

Mine has Sophie.

Mine has a saxophone.

Mine has a cupcake.

Mine has a chainsaw.

[imitates chainsaw]

Hey, everybody!

Holiday shopping tip:

Fill a Starbucks cup
with vodka.

Also good for waitressing.

Sophie, were you
Christmas shopping?

(Sophie)
Oh, you know I was!

Power strips!

Oh good.
You got surge protectors.

Wow, that's the first time
protection's

ever been used
in your apartment.

Well, my Christmas village
needs 75,000 watts.

And that's just to work
my candy cane helicopter.

Sophie's been so busy

with the Polish Society
Decorating Contest.

We haven't had sex
in days.

Well, I got to beat my nemesis,
Felka Bobenski.

She wins every year.

She's like the Modern Family
of Christmas decorations

You know who's having
a blue Christmas this year?

My balls.

I love this city
at the holidays.

Yeah, the urine's
all frozen

so you can't really
smell it.

Manhattan is the best place
to buy quality Christmas gifts.

We have 40 bucks.

Now, where are
those duffel bags

full of stolen electronics
sold for half the price

by Nairobi refugees?

Well, we better
find them soon

or I'm going to give up
and go to Radio Shack

like everyone else
who goes to Radio Shack.

[gasps]
Oh my God, Max.

My childhood bank.

You had a childhood bank?

I didn't even have
a childhood.

Come on, let's go.
I stop in every few months

to get caught on
the security cameras,

so people will think
I'm still in the mix.

Trying to get caught
on security cameras?

Whoa, we are different.

Yeah, we'll just go in
and while we're in here,

well, I don't know,
ask for a business loan.

We are not getting
a business loan!

You tricked me
into coming to the city.

At least knock me out and put me
in the trunk like a person.

Okay, I hear you.
No loan.

But can we at least
go in there

so I can get a hit
off some vault fumes

and a complimentary
Christmas cocoa?

Yeah, I want one too.

It's so cold out here my bra is
suing my nipples for assault.

I'd say we ask for
$15,000.

So close I almost
smelled 100.

What is with you?

If I wanted you to keep
lying to me,

I'd date you.

Max, we need more capital

so we can buy
our shirts in bulk,

and then,
if we work even harder,

we can double our profit.

Okay, we won't pass
even the credit check.

According to my
Social Security number,

I died in a boat explosion
years ago.

This is the time
to apply.

Bankers have more guilt
at Christmastime

because of
It's A Wonderful Life.

And also 'cause
they're Jewish.

I'm the one
with the business degree,

and you have to trust me
on this.

You know what?
You're right.

You're the business genius.
What do I know?

Let's go get that loan.

Thank you!

Yeah, I should have known
that was too good to be true.

Max, come on.

The bank's there.
Our shirt's in here.

Let's just go in, show them,
and apply for that loan.

Please!
- No.

Please!
- No.

Please!
- No.

And that right there
was a little something

called "us asking
for a bank loan."

Now let's go.

I'm not leaving here
until you tell me

what the underlying
issue is.

I'm not in love
with you anymore.

Max, be serious.

This whole t-shirt
was your idea.

What's the real problem?

That's the problem.

Those shirts were my idea

and nothing that comes from me
is worth $15,000.

Aside from that baby
I sold on E-baby.

Max, I know these t-shirts
are a money-maker.

Oh, I have a money-maker
and that's not it.

I can prove it.

Look, this is Rodney,

my childhood over-priced
clothing store.

If I had known we were going
on the childhood tour today,

I would have worn more
comfortable shoes

and stayed home.

See the shirt
on the mannequin?

At least $200.

And there's no reason we can't
sell ours for just as much.

I'll show you.
Follow me.

Oh, okay, I will.
But not on Instagram,

'cause you're
out of control.

This place is fancy

and I've been to the
new Port Authority in Newark.

Just trust me, okay?

You need to jump on
those Wang pumps

or like Ben Affleck,
they will be "Gone, girl."

Let me do the talking.
I speak his language.

And what language is that?
Portu-gays?

Hello, ladies.
Welcome to Rodney.

I'm Barry.

Doing a little
holiday shopping?

We're not allowed
to say Christmas.

As a matter of fact, we're doing
a little holiday selling.

Oh, you're "selling."
- Yeah.

Got it.
Molly? Coke?

Not that I'm interested.

I've been clean since
Fire Island 2010.

And 2012.

It must be hard to not
be high and be you.

Because it's hard for me

to just be near you
and not be high.

Yeah, you get it, girl.

Actually, we wanted to see
if you'd be interested

in selling one of our
fabulous graphic t-shirts.

Oh, n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n--
all sorts of "no," okay?

As much as I love a fez,
a caftan, and a teenage boy,

this isn't Morocco.

That's a really long
and boring version of "No."

It's like you just did
"No! The One Woman Show."

Here's our t-shirt--
- Look.

I'll tell you two what
I said to a young Marc Jacobs.

Stop offering,
I'm off the junk.

Merry Holiday.

I'll show Mary
a holiday.

Our shirts are just
as good as these.

He just needs
to see it.

Here, hold this.

What are you?
American Psycho?

As soon as someone
says "no" to you,

you start
dismembering women.

I can't get
her shirt off.

Tell her she can
spend the night

and you'll buy her
a waffle in the morning.

Okay, hand me our shirt.

I think this
is gonna be big for us.

You also think
Michael Buble rocks.

Oh, I have to hurry.
Barry is coming.

Barry is coming.

I'm guessing
mostly with strangers.

Seriously?

Seriously?

Ser-i-ous-ly?

So cute.

And look on the back,
"Cream Filled."

Funny.

People will think
I have a personality.

Barry, put this
with my other stuff.

How much?
300.

Forget the sober story.
That guy is high.

I'll take ten.

They'll make great
Hanukkah gifts

for my friends
who don't hate their arms.

All our shirts just got bought
by a rich dead lady.

I'll need 30 more
by Friday.

Yes, I'm still holding.

I need to place
a rush t-shirt order.

No, no, no, no, no.
Don't put me on hold again.

I've been through
seven rounds of

Grandma Got Run Over
By A Reindeer.

And she just got
run over again.

Now that we have all this
crazy gay t-shirt money,

I think we should
up the prices on these gifts.

So we agree,
we're getting Earl a car.

Sophie is getting
the country house

with the lake
she's always wanted.

Max, Rodney is selling
our shirts for 300,

but we only get 25
of that.

And you can't buy a house
for $750.

It's not Detroit.

Yes, hi, hi, hi.
Finally a person.

I need 50 t-shirts
by Friday.

But your business card says you
guarantee next-day delivery.

Oh, you can't "guarantee"
that guarantee?

Okay, now Oleg.

What do you get a man
who has nothing,

but shows you everything?

What do you mean
"Is there anything else

you can help me with?"
When did you help me at all?

And I'm beginning to think
if Grandma works for you,

she didn't get run over
by that reindeer,

she threw herself
under a sleigh.

So, Sophie's getting
a Snapple.

Like last year.

Max, we can't give up.
We can do them ourselves.

We just need someone else
to do them.

Come on, let's go.

There are customers
who have been here

since Robin Thicke
was relevant.

Wait a minute, Han.
You silk-screened all those

beautiful cards.
You have an artistic side.

Yeah, but no backside.

And a front side that shouldn't
be allowed outside.

[imitates chainsaw]

Why is this taking
so long?

You did all those
Christmas cards.

Aren't small creatures
supposed to be fast?

Truth be told, those were
supposed to be ready last year.

But, what was the rush?
You two weren't going anywhere.

Han, just a simple
"Yes" or "No".

No judgment.

Have you had sex
with this machine?

The only thing worse than
you two working for me

is me working for you.

You haven't even
given me water.

Water is for closers.

By "closers," I mean people
who actually make clothes.

[knock on door]

Who's that?

Han, did you call
Child Protective Service on us?

'Cause those bruises
could be from anyone.

Han, you've only made
one shirt in two hours.

And it's a masterpiece.
Do you want one Citizen Kane

or 30 Here Comes
the Booms?

Guys, I need your help.

Sophie's right behind me
and needs some cheering up.

I haven't seen her
this depressed

since she woke up
mid-coitus last night.

Hi.

Hi.
Hi, girls.

Merry Christmas.

Quick question:

if I were to turn on that oven
and close all the windows,

would I die?

Nope.

Otherwise I wouldn't be
standing here

next to
Kim Jong-Only-Done-One.

Sophie, what's the problem?

Tell Han while he gets
back to work.

And Han, pick up the pace

or I'm going to start
the pinching again.

I'm gonna lose the
Christmas decorating contest.

Oh, I have nothing
to live for.

Oh, Caroline, this is probably
how you feel every day.

Sophie's competition
made a live-action

North Pole workshop
in front of her house.

Well, all I got upstairs
is a light-up nativity

and $25,000 worth of
Target Christmas decorations.

She blew five fuses
last night.

I never thought
I'd be jealous of a fuse.

Sophie, we really can't
get into this now.

We are way behind
with these t-shirts.

And these t-shirts are
a once in a lifetime

Ow!
- chance for us to go to
a new place with our business.

Oh yeah,
I hear you, girls.

I mean, what am I doing here
sitting worrying about

some silly contest?

It's Christmas.

Come on everybody.

We should all be
helping the girls.

Really?
that would be so amazing.

Sure! And you wouldn't even
have to pay me back

by letting me use your barn and
your horse tomorrow night

for a live nativity scene, which
you would all have to be in.

Or something like that.

I think we just had
a seasonal shake-down.

Han's doing the last one.
We're gonna make it.

I can't believe you're in such
a good mood with that beard.

Last week when you found
those two chin hairs,

you weren't so chipper.

I'm just so happy
I have new clothes.

Okay, final shirt.

Then I get you two
out of my angel hair.

Han, you know,
if it weren't for you,

we would have never
gotten this done.

You really are
a little angel.

Yeah, you are.
But I'm still surprised

you weren't cast
as the baby.

Oh, I was asked,
but I declined.

I spent ten year
getting out of diapers.

I'm not getting
back in.

Han, for your Christmas gift,

I'll pretend
I never heard that.

Places everybody.

The judges are coming.
I'm ready.

Joseph's ready.
Cabbage Patch Christ is ready.

Come on!

What's with the cleavage?

I know.

She's like
the Not-So-Virgin Mary.

Angel, Shepherd,
Lady with the beard,

come on,
get in the stable.

Stable?

The way we look
it should be an "unstable."

- Everybody ready?
I'm going to open the barn door.

Okay.
- Yeah, I think
your barn door's

already a little open.

Okay now,
who am I again?

Voltron?

I'm not gonna lie.
One of the wise men

might have smoked
some "myrrh-ijuana."

That was a very nice
Christmas gift, Max.

Thanks, Earl.
By the way, Sophie,

the barn and us
dressed like idiots?

That's your
Christmas gift.
- Oh.

Oh, and hey,
bang Oleg later.

Oleg,
that's your gift.

How did you know?

Before they come in, let's just
take a moment to look around

and really let in
the true spirit of Christmas.

I don't remember
writing you a monologue.

Shut up!
Get your ass over by the horse.

Come on, Han.
Hit the music.

[Christmas music playing]
All right, everybody,

look holy.

Best I can do
is my underwear.

all: Ooh!

O h , crap!

Oh, that's right, Felka.

I'm the freakin'
mother of God.

[chuckles]
We won!

I'm so happy we won.

We won! We Won!

Okay, show's over.

Dump the kid,
I'll be upstairs.

Max, take care of
Cabbage Patch Christ.

Here, Han.
You got a buddy your own size.

Thank you so much,
Barry.

And remember, I want
50 more shirts

after the first of the year
after I'm back from rehab.

'Cause ladies, I am planning
a very white Christmas.

Max, this is amazing!

Do you know what just
happened in there?

Yeah, I stole some dope-ass
fingerless gloves.

We're in business
with them now.

You have to bring
those back.

I got them for you.
- Okay.

This is like
a Christmas miracle.

Our shirts are being sold
in the most exclusive

bitchy boutique in Manhattan
and they want more, lots more.

Hey, let's go into your
childhood bank.

I need to take
an adult pee.

Okay, but this isn't home,
so remember,

put the seat down
when you're done.

And while we're in there,
we can apply for that loan.

No, no, no, no, no.
We can't.

Now I'm afraid.

Come on,
what's the real issue here?

We just had this
amazing success.

And it looks like things
are going our way,

and if we go in there,
it could all be ruined.

You know what would ruin
our lives even more?

If we don't get that loan
and have to spend hours

with Han standing under us
trying to finish those shirts.

Well, that's a real
"Nightmare Before Christmas."

Let's go.
- Good, cause I'm
starting to pee a little.

He gave us a loan!

Is everyone who works
on the street high?

I can't believe it.
It didn't go bad.

I'm getting everything
I want.

Walk on the outside
of the sidewalk.

I'm gonna get hit
by a bus.

I mean, how could he
give us a loan?

I didn't even have to
flash my boobs.

Then why did you
do it?

I don't know.
They were making it rain.

I felt obliged.

Max, do you have
a dollar?

I don't know.
Do you have change for 10,000?

Yeah, here. For what?
For those less fortunate

Anne Hathaway's here?

[bell ringing]

Oh, my God.
Look! Look!

Whoa, no way!
No way!

Max, I have chills.

Well, it is snowing and there's
no fingers on those gloves.

I love these.

I'm sorry I didn't
get you anything.

I'm just not a thief.

What do you mean
you didn't get me anything?

You got me everything.
Look.

[bell ringing]

[Christmas music playing]

¶ ¶

Come on, Max!
Class is starting.

I saved you a spot next to me.

MAX: Be right there.
Strapping in the girls.

Lefty's a little cranky
this morning.

Thanks for getting
these work out bands

out of the Equinox dumpster.

I was already in there.
I had a meeting

with my accountant.

We're not doing great,
by the way.

We're gonna do resistance work
with them.

I'm already resistant.

I'm almost at violent.

Do what I'm doing.

Let my crack stick out?

And pulse, and pulse, and pulse.

Let me just get rid of
that pulse for you.

Come on, Max, the heart machine
at Rite Aid said you were 80

and printed you a prescription
for a wheelchair.

On the count of three.

One, two, three.

Is there a bed on me?

Get my wheelchair.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Hey, girls.

Check out Barbara's new ride.

We need help.

And not just because Barbara
has a luxury SUV before I do.

-(straining)
-Ohh.

Great workout.

I'm gonna cool down
with a bagel.

No, I just came down here
to bring you your mail.

And Barbara wanted
to show off her car

because you girls are poor.

Overdue cell phone bill,
electricity--

Sophie, this mail
is from a month ago.

What?
It's mail, not cottage cheese.

Oh, wait.
I think there might be

a little cottage cheese
in there.

Got any of that for my bagel?

Oh, my God.
The movie they're making

about my life is coming out.

Is it called Good Will Boring?

And Max, we're invited
to the press junket

to promote the movie.

In two days?

Uh-oh.

I don't even think my hair girl
could help you in time

and she's got three hands.

Sophie, I hope it's not
too late to RSVP.

I was waiting for some news
about the movie.

I thought it went
to the wrong person.

Like my 20s.

Come on, Barbara.
Let's cruise the playground

and make fun of babies
in Chevy Volts.

(car beeping)

Uh, can Barbara drop me off
at Equinox?

They throw out
the expired Clif Bars at 3:30.

Oh, Han, Max and I

have to do press for my movie,

so we can't work tomorrow.

I get it.
Why break your six-year streak?

I guess with
all your movie money,

you two can move on
and I can hire two waitresses

who don't use my office
as a gambling hall.

Han, Caroline already spent
all the movie money

on the dessert bar.

Also, I need your office
in 20 minutes.

We're interviewing
a new roulette dealer.

Well, can you at least
tell people

not to put cigarettes out
on my family photos?

There's a giant hole
in my grandma.

Ooh!
They just sent a cast list.

(gasps)
Guess who's playing me?

Tess Walker.

She is a very big--

hold on, let me read what
she's a very big.

If it's big-boobed,
they did zero research.

Tess is from Australia.
She's a rising star

and got her start in the
romantic comedy G'day Kate.

Max, you're being played by
Vanessa Robinson.

Not a name,
but that's what they do.

Vanessa Robinson?

She's on my favorite
Disney show,

That's So Vanessa Robinson.

How do they expect a Disney
goody-two-shoes to play me?

She won't be realistic
playing high or drunk

or fighting the bear
from The Revenant.

Ooh, Max, who's playing me?

Michelle Kim?

I'm being played by a woman?

Calm down, not a woman.
It's an 11-year-old girl.

And she's probably more upset
about it than you are.

That's preposterous.
An 11-year-old girl

couldn't own a diner.

You do.

Hey, guys.
I picked up your lunch.

There were two other orders
from customers in here.

Hey.

Bobby, Tess Walker is playing me
in the movie about me.

From G'day Kate!

Oh, yeah.
She's Kate, right?

Or or the one
that says "G'day" to her?

Either way,
she's not as pretty as you.

Ohh, you know exactly what
I tell you to say.

Ooh, the fries are good
from not here.

Oleg, try these.

Hey, Oleg.

It says here you're being played
by Pete Chilton.

My gosh, he's the one who played
the serial killer

in that funny movie we saw.

I hope the penis is accurate.

This is a full frontal role,
right?

It is here.

Oh, it doesn't look like
there's a Sophie character.

(gasps) Oh, but there is
one named Pearl,

a Black Polish woman who works
as the diner's cashier.

What?

They combined me with Earl?

I mean, if I wanted
to be combined with someone,

I wouldn't have given up a liver

to be separated from my twin.

Hey, they made me a woman?

I haven't been a woman
since I was trying to outrun

the mob with Marilyn Monroe.

Oh, holy crap, Caroline.

Your ex Candy Andy's
a character in the movie

and he's gonna be
at the press junkie.

Junket.
 You're a junkie, get it right.

And Candy Andy?
Why is he in the movie?

Shouldn't he be old enough to go
by Candrew Andrew at this point?

Bobby, before you get
crazy jealous,

he is very handsome and I went
places with him sexually

that I had never been before.

But--ah, anyway, I'm with you,
now, and he's married.

That's cool, I'm just--
I'm just not a jealous guy.

I am confident in our
rock solid relationship.

Well, that's very annoying.

All these reporters and
photographers remind me

of when I lost my baby teeth.

Oh, my father left
a summer home under my pillow.

I left my baby teeth in the
octagon with Ronda Rousey.

This would be
a great opportunity

to plug our dessert bar.

Let's do a lap and start

whispering about ourselves
to get a buzz going.

If you think I don't already
have a buzz going at 11:00 a.m.,

then you don't know me.

(gasps) Oh, my God, that's
the Sophie and Earl mash-up.

(gasps) She was the football
coach on Girl Meets World!

This is getting real!

Caroline Channing?

I'm Daisy.
I'm with the PR team.

Maybe you've heard of me.
Kylie Jenner threw

a full can of Sprite
at my head last year.

That's why my pupils are so big!

Daisy, don't worry.
I am not high maintenance.

How can I be sure
that all photos of me

are taken on the north side
of my face?

I'm Max. Uh, what does it mean
when you don't have pupils?

(laughs)
You guys are so cute.

Oh, I know you haven't
seen the movie,

so I'll give you
a quick rundown of what happens

for press questions.

Uh, let's see.
You lose your money.

Sad, sad, sad.
And then you meet this one.

Sad, sad, sad.

-You are so cute.
-Oh.

It's not as much about
the two of you anymore.

The storyline came off
a little lesbionic,

which is kinda last year.

I just came off
a little lesbionic.

Maggie won't stop calling me.

(gasps)
Oh, my God.

There's Tess.
Oh, she's flawless.

She's the perfect me.

Tess, It's me!
You, Caroline!

Oh, and the young lady playing
you hasn't shown up yet.

Oh, that's what the real Max
should've done.

You're so cute.
No, she went real method

in researching the role of you.

And now she's real into drugs.

I'm so upset.
You just can't tell

because I'm heavily medicated.

Hello, unattended bar.

Caroline Channing in person.

Oh, this must be
what it was like

when Julia Roberts
met Erin Brockovich.

Or the other way around.

Oh, and this is Brent,
the actor playing Candy Andy.

Should it be awkward between us

since you're playing one
in a long string

of two ex-boyfriends?

Thanks.

Thanks for having
a tragic life

so I could fall
in love on screen.

And off.

Uh, see, I think audiences
would much rather

see me wind up with, let's say,
a working class,

blue collar contractor,
maybe named Bobby.

You're so cute.
No, it was pretty obvious

to everyone you should wind up
with Candy Andy.

Yeah, I thought so, too.

(gasps)
Candy Andy!

I do not go by
that silly name, Max.

It's Candrew Andrew.

-Andrew.
-Hey.

You look great.

Oh, sorry, ooh.

You two are like me and my
eighth grade science teacher.

Just can't keep your hands
off each other.

Max, you ruined
Mr. Brillstein's life,

and, like Mr. Brillstein,
Andy is married.

Oh, uh, well,
actually I'm divorced.

(gasps)

There's your
M. Night Shyamalan twist!

But don't let him direct
the rest of the movie.

Oh, how about a picture of
you two for the photographers?

You look great together.

(camera shutters clicking)

I'm sorry your marriage
didn't work out.

Yeah, me too.

My father-in-law had
box seats to the Rangers.

You look beautiful.

You have my lipstick
on your mouth.

Oh, well,
maybe we wear the same shade.

That'll be six--ehh, $27.

Hey, Earl.
Don't get up.

No chance of that,
unless they start

making Viagra
for the entire body.

Uh, Caroline's not here.
What do you need?

Actually, I wanted to
talk to you guys.

Obviously.

You have nothing
to worry about, Andy.

I mean, Bobby.

Much like the copy of TV Guide

Earl is currently reading,

Candy Andy is old news.

Ooh, there's another episode

of Facts of Life
tonight, you know?

Hey, everybo--

Wouldn't you like to finish
that sentence for me, Earl?

Since you don't have your own
character in Caroline's movie.

Yeah, you're right.

I got nothing to worry about.

I should get going.

Hey, Andy.

I mean, Bobby.

Look, did you see this picture

of Caroline with Candy Andy?

Look, he's got his arm
around her at a junket.

Is that hand on her lower back
or upper butt?

Hey, man, it's a good thing
you're not the jealous type.

Especially since he has his hand
right on her ass.

Hey...I was gonna say that!

Can you at least give me
one thing of my own, Earl?

* I'll be in our booth

I'm from the New York Times.

Ha, what the hell
are you doing here?

I have a question for Tess.

In G'day Kate, you married
a kangaroo for a green card?

So this is super weird, right?

Looking at them, being us.

Andy, I can't talk now.
I have to promote my dessert bar

and answer all these questions.

You know how reporters get when
they have a fascinating subject.

Caroline, no one's asked you
anything and they already

told you to stop
raising your hand.

Max, the actress playing you
isn't here.

It's been reported
she's been on a downward spiral

ever since
she got into the role.

Her behavior is disgusting,

Caroline, I have
a question for you about us.

A Q & A is not the place
for questions.

Well, fine,
I won't ask you, then.

I'll just tell you.

I miss you
and your adorable crooked smile.

I mean, look at
the Hollywood us.

We could be
the real version of them.

Just, you know,
I wouldn't wear guyliner.

Caroline, fate brought us
together for a reason.

I mean, we had
a really good thing.

I think we should
give it another shot.

Caroline Channing, you said
you own a dessert bar now?

Oh--ohh.

Caroline's speechless.

Guess I'm down to two wishes
on that magic lamp.

So what do you think?

Hey, I test positive for stuff
all the time.

I'm not allowed to donate
or get blood,

but other than that, it's cool.

Ugh, Andy and I
do look great together.

What if America knows more
about me than I do?

Then I feel worse for America
than I already do.

I-I don't know why
any of this matters.

Andy knows you have a boyfriend.

(gasps)
I didn't tell him.

Why didn't I tell him?

And boom goes the Shyamalan.

Hey, Max, they don't have
chocolate milk, I asked.

Ugh! How do they expect me
to wash down my scrimps?

Caroline, can we just talk
and maybe spend

the rest of our lives together?

You know, keep it casual.

Hey!
Mr. Candy guy!

Get your hands off my girl!

Ouch!

Dude, you spilled my drink!

She's my girlfriend.

No, she is not.
Who are you?

Bobby, you attacked the wrong
Andy in a jealous rage.

He's over here.

Hey, how's it going?
Should I put my drink down?

Ah, no...I've embarrassed
myself enough.

I'm sorry, Caroline.
I just couldn't stand

the thought of you doing it
with another guy

once a week in the beginning.

Bobby, I love that you're
jealous--violently jealous.

But you don't need to be.

-Andy, I have a boyfriend.
-Mm.

A violently jealous boyfriend.

I wouldn't say violently.

I choked you out
for a Pop-Tart this morning.

All right.
Super awkward right now.

Um, well, I guess
I'm gonna have to go

cancel the Mariachi band
I hired to serenade us.

Adios, $10 deposit.

Ooh, you should bring them by
the dessert bar.

I'm having an after party there
with the cast.

(gasps)
We are?

Mm, well...I guess now
you're invited, too.

And here's something else
you can use.

When I rent a car,
I usually go with the Sebring.

I'm starting to see why
they cut most of my scenes.

Once I rented a Tercel.
Once.

I gotta take this.

I know it's not ringing,
but you get it.

Will the real Han
please stand up?

And then leave.

* I'll be in my booth

* I'll be in my booth

* I'll be in my booth

* I'll be in my booth

You just don't get it.

Can I mix alcohol
and, like, five red pills?

Ha, would I be standing here
if you couldn't?

Uh, this might seem weird
or maybe just freaky enough,

but I am very attracted to
that part of her that is me.

You know what, Earl?
You play your cards right,

you might be screwing
yourself tonight.

What's up, girl?

Did I tell you
that I got super rich?

Yeah, got injured at Six Flags.

Not even in a cool way.

Tripped on a fat kid,
landed on a skinny kid.

Maybe you should go for Tess.

I bet she'll be single soon

since Bobby's jealous rage

sent her boyfriend
to the hospital.

I did not.
I got his autograph.

He voiced a parakeet
in Zootopia.

Cacaw.
Ring a bell?

Well, I guess this is good-bye.

I won't see you
at the premiere next week.

I'm gonna go
drown my sorrows in Paris.

And Bali.
Well, wherever they have

the most expensive jewels.

Anything?

I'm right here.

Guys, don't fight over me

until I have the camera open
on my phone.

Well, you're a lucky guy, Bobby.

Just--by the way,
she is a really horrible...

No, I can't think of anything.

She's pretty perfect.

I'm sure if you tried
really hard

you'll find someone
willing to date

a very attractive rich guy
in the prime of his life.

Now you're making me
want to date him.

Well, I better get going.

Helicopter traffic
gets crazy at 8:00.

Anything?

both: Helicopter?

Well...
(sighs)

I've been trying
to look for Vanessa,

but she probably goes
by her gang name, now.

I couldn't find her
on my police scanner,

but it did help me avoid
selling weed

to an undercover cop.

(walkie-talkie crackles)

Copy that, Sarge.

All right, Oleg.
Let's go.

It's Wednesday, so we gotta
take the garbage out

so we can do it under the sink.

Sophie.

That's not me.

But my God, he is gorgeous.

Only I was covered in nougat.

Let's go, one of the Olegs.

All right, bye, Max.

Oh, hi, Max.

Max?
Vanessa's here!

Oh, my God.
You're gonna be okay.

Just keep drinking.
You tried being me too fast.

-I just--
-Don't talk, drink.

How are you not dead?

Shh.

(gasps)
Did you see that?

She's never
patted my head like that.

And she even gave me a birthday
coupon for one free head pat.

Is that jealousy I see?

Max and I are in
a strong relationship.

I am not jealous.

Are they in a full-on hug now?
I'm redeeming my coupon.

(Mariachi music playing)

*

(laughs)

Anything?

No?
Okay, cut it.

Uh, all right, come on.
Who likes helicopter rides?

(together)
Helicopter?

(cash register dings)

Max, did you pick up
the tip from table two?

No, but I'm pretty sure
I picked up a staph infection.

So they literally gave me
their two cents worth.

This is so embarrassing,

even Abe Lincoln
won't make eye contact.

Girls, I need you
to do something for me.

You know the rule:
nothing for you,

on you, near you,
or in us.

I'm going to restroom.
Keep eye on the kitchen.

I have a four-minute egg
and a five-minute date

with the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Issue.

Hey, do you see
what I see?

A fire?

No, a way out
of this job.

Lord Jesus,
there's a fire.

You two gonna do
anything about that?

'Cause I'm not.

I don't mess with fire
or Presbyterians.

Fire, fire!

I smell fire!

Well, don't just stand there.
Do something!

We are.

S'mores!

You'd think you want this place
to burn to the ground.

You'd think that.

Caroline,
do something.

I'm on it.
Chocolate?

(Caroline)
Han, not too close.

You know you can never
get the smell of Korean barbecue

out of your clothes.

[shouting]

[shouts weakly]

Either
he put the fire out,

or that little robot
just had an orgasm.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

Ooh Ooh ¶

Welcome to The High
dessert bar.

I'm the hostess
slash quasi-manager.

First day in,
got a huge promosh.

I hate to brag,

but the word "dazzling"
was used.

Yeah, by you.

Little to no power
has really gone to your head.

It has.

She's like
the Putin of pastry.

But doesn't it
feel good

to not just be working
at the diner?

I haven't slipped
on one used baby diaper all day.

Speaking of babies,

look,
there's Han.

That's, like,
the third time

I caught him
spying on us.

Why would he stalk
two of his worst employees?

I know.

It's like Where's Waldo?

when you don't want
to find Waldo.

Not seeing a hostess
up in here.

She meant
quasi-manager.

If Marty Scorsese
walks in here,

do you want him
to seat himself?

He'll be lost.
Lost.

Sorry, Joe, I was just
over there giving Max--

Honey, I'll download
an audiobook

if I want
to hear a story.

I want you
to meet someone.

Me too, and I'm sure
I will when the time is right

and I'm open to it.

Kind of focusing on me
right now.

Stop.

Learn to read faces.

I'm not talking
about you.

I'm talking
about him.

[with Irish accent]
Hello, pleasure
to meet you.

I'm Nashit.

Nashit's
an Indian name,

and isn't that
an Irish accent I detect?

Or have I just
lost consciousness

from how white
your teeth are?

Yes, it is.

My father's Indian.
My mother's Irish.

He's Irish.
He's Indian.

He's East
meets West.

He's everything

in a hot Irish coffee,
boy band package.

I found him
on the street

next to a dirty chair.

Hi, I'm Caroline, the hostess
slash quasi-manager

at The High.

Are you high?

'Cause that was
a lot of talking.

Who is this,
and where can I get one?

This is Nashit,
our new waiter.

Oh, it's lovely
to meet you.

[gasps]

Can you say
"magically delicious"?

I really want Nashit
to work out.

I like it when
good-looking people succeed.

Well, I guess
that's good news for me.

Is it?

Hi, honey.

(Joe)
Have you met
the new waiter?

I love him.
He's my favorite.

If I did men,
he would've been done by now.

Hmm, so you think
you're pretty.

Well, I do too.

Okay, Nashit,
pay attention.

These are the tables.
This is the dessert bar.

And these are
my boobs.

Max, be professional.

These are
my boobs, sir.

Please, I have
to make him a waiter.

Fine, you make him
a waiter,

and I'll just
make him later.

Here you go.
This isn't yours, is it?

No, because
they already have dessert.

Damn it.

You asked for water,
like, an hour ago, didn't you?

I'm so sorry.

Oh, don't you worry
those lips.

And what's an hour when we have
our whole lives ahead of us?

Max, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

I stink
as a waiter.

This is desperate.

Well, desperate times
call for us making out.

Hey, I have
a question for you.

Your skin is
so creamy and white.

You must have
a little Irish in you.

I've had a lot
of little Irishes in me.

That's meant
to be dirty, right?

Well, I just mean that I think
you're quite beautiful.

Oh, well, then I just mean
we're doing it.

I did not think
there was somebody

who had a prettier nose
or was worse than me

waiting tables,
but here we are.

Nashit, there's not a fork
in the mix out there.

Now, get out there
and fork those women.

Take it easy on him.

I don't him to be
all forked out

by the time
he gets to me.

I'm gonna have so much sex
on my bed with Nashit

that I'm gonna need
a new sheet.

Aren't you
too old for him?

Yeah, but that test
said mentally I'm 14,

so we can
totally do it.

Well, I'm off to Chinatown
to have someone

put needles in me.

Oh, my God.
I love your coat.

You look gorgeous.

I mean,
the way it flows.

Okay, so I can see
you're a kiss-ass,

so here's the thing.

As my quasi-manager,

or whatever nonsense
you're telling people,

I need you to tell
Max and Nashit to cool it.

There are no hookups
here at The High.

Done, and we can stop
staying "quasi"

if we're both on board
with the manager thing.

We're not.

The High is
about fine pastry,

not someone's
sordid love life.

And in an ironic twist,
I need you to kick

my girlfriend's
hot ass out of here

if she comes in.

Here's $100.

That's $100.

Consider her hot ass
out the door.

We're in a fight.

She got drunk,
stole my Black Card,

and bought 90 people soup
at Barney Greengrass,

and the soup isn't
even good there.

Do not take this as a no,
because I want the money,

but why can't you
just tell her yourself?

I can't
tell her myself.

She's younger than me,
and everyone knows

the mommy thing
just isn't sexy.

Make sure she eats something
and gets home safe.

Caroline, I have
a question for you.

What do I do with the notes
the women give me?

You've gotten notes?

Just a few.

[gasps]

How could women
be this desperate?

Max, this one's
from you.

They're mostly
all from me,

except the business card.

I don't need
no damn card

to let him know
I'm all business.

Max, Joe just told me there are
no hookups at The High,

and judging from this
very detailed picture you drew,

that's exactly
what you're planning.

Oh, I was planning more.
I just ran out of paper.

We can't lose
these jobs.

I have two $100 bills,
and I'm this close

to pulling the trigger
on an Amazon Prime account.

Amazon Prime?

You have been driven mad
with power.

Fresh, flakey pastry.

And speaking of flakes,

there's Joe's
flakey girlfriend.

Can someone help me
get my chair off my coat?

How did she
get in here?

Probably floated in
on a cloud of Valium.

It's go time,
as in she's got to go.

You have a better chance
moving an actual train wreck,

but good luck.

- Allie, hi, you--
- Shh.

[whispering]
Allie, hi.

- You need--
- Sorry.

But I am hungover,
and I have a headache.

Could I get a latte
with a side of weed?

No, because
this isn't Amsterdam

or Bill Maher's house.

Now, you need
to leave.

You know Joe
doesn't want you in here.

Well, I'm
not leaving.

My legs won't move

because my muscle relaxers
just kicked in.

John, can you
do me a favor?

Walk Allie outside,

and by that,
I mean pick her up

and carry her outside.

I went
to pastry school.

I'm not Shrek.

Of course not.
You're much more Fiona.

Girl, that's good.

I was gonna say the donkey,
'cause I have a fine ass.

(Allie)
Okay, fine.

Driver, two stops.
Barney's and fro-yo.

(Max)
Earl, we're late again.
Did you keep us alive?

Max, I can barely
keep myself alive.

This morning,
I had to jump-start my heart

by putting my finger
in the socket

Tom and Jerry style.

Oh, hello.

So what did
you girls do today?

I haven't seen you
since right here last night.

Oh, really, Han?

'Cause I swear
I saw you lurking around

outside The High.

It was either you,

or Pikachu
is visiting New York.

That one
barely grazed me,

because I'm Korean,

and Pikachu
is Japanese.

You don't know anything
about Pokemon.

Han, you may not
be Japanese,

but in the future,
you're definitely

gonna be poked
by a mon.

And it was you.

No, it was not.

- Yeah, it was.
- Wasn't.

- Was.
- Wasn't.

- Wasn't.
- Was--wasn't.

English is
my second language.

Admit it,
you're jealous

we're spending time
with another restaurant.

I am not jealous.

- Are so.
- Am not.

- Am not.
- Are so--not.

Oh, my God!

Caroline, what the hell
are you doing?

I'm smelling
a $100 bill.

It's from
my other restaurant.

It buys me
nice things.

Jealous?

I took you in
when you had no one.

Hi, can you
help me?

I'm looking for Max.

Why, hello.
Is it too late to be gay?

Nashit?

Oh, my God,
he even looks good here

in morgue light.

We are
so doing it.

Caroline, you left
your phone on the table

at the restaurant.

I confess,
I used it as an excuse

to come
and see Max.

This isn't mine.
It's Joe's girlfriend's.

I don't have
an iPhone 6.

I have an iPhone sick.

D-O-I-N-G it!

Max, why
is Nashit here?

Because God owes me.

You can't seriously
be into him.

He looks like
someone in a boy band.

Yeah, and he's going
one direction...

Down there.

But if you sleep
with him,

then Nashit
is gonna hit the fan.

How do you know
you even like him?

You know what I like?
That we're doing it.

Hey, everybody!

I just got hit
by a cab,

and, boy, am I in the mood
for crab legs.

The thing
about you, baby--

you bounce back
from a good pounding

every single night.

Wait a minute.

That's my booth.

Oh, it's lovely
to meet you.

What?

What the hell
kind of accent is that?

I'm from Ireland.

What?

Max, you are
not doing it.

- Are.
- Not.

- Are.
- Not.

- Not.
- Please, I went to Wharton.

Look, we should go
to your place when we do it

so that Caroline won't be there
while we're doing it.

Lovely, but I just came
to America two days ago.

I have no place to go.

In fact, I've been sleeping
on that dirty chair

Joe spoke of.

What?

Is he singing?

Oh, my God.

He's gorgeous
and homeless?

That's your
dream guy.

We are so doing it!

Ugh, this is
impossible.

I feel like I'm putting
an Oscar dress on Precious.

I'm making up
the couch for Nashit.

That is so nice of you.

He's gonna need a place
to crash after we have sex.

No, that's
off the table.

I can't believe
you invited him to stay here.

And I can't believe
you refused

to sleep at Starbucks tonight
to give us some privacy.

I mean, you like
Nora Jones.

[whistling]

Max likey.

- Max, listen.
- No, you listen.

I can't afford candy,
so he has got to be it.

Thanks for the shower.

Oh, no, his muscles
point to his penis.

[knock at door]

Max, stop
with the banging.

I'm not letting you out
while you're still in heat.

(Max)
It's not me.

I'm making a list
of ways to kill you!

I feel like
I'm being a bother,

and I think I'm sleeping
on a bong.

[knock at door]

(Joe)
Open up.

I know what's going on
in there.

(Caroline)
Oh, my God.

That's Joe.

She must've found out
about you and Max hooking up.

(Nashit)
Oh, no.

Max, Joe is here.

You need to do
that thing you do

to scare people
out of the hallway.

What do we think,
guard dog

or little old lady
with poor eyesight

and loaded gun?

[Max imitating dog barking]

Fine, I'm going.

This is why
I never leave Manhattan.

Hey, you need to get
in the girls' apartment?

I have a key.

Find it here
in my big bag.

I know it's
in here somewhere.

Well, I got
the lip balm.

I got--Oh, look,
I got the Holy Bible.

I got--

Oh, look.
Oh, the DirecTV remote.

Oh, my God,
I'm losing estrogen.

Max, you and Nashit
go hide in your room,

but no sex.

You heard her,
no sex,

so everything but,
and I mean everything,

and I mean but.

Oh, here it is.
It's right--

It was right under the cold cuts
the whole time.

(Joe)
Caroline.

Hey.
Hi, Joe.

Oh!

Yeah.

Ha!

Yeah, the shorter hair
makes sense now.

(Sophie)
Yeah.

Good for you,
Caroline.

I hope you like
long, boring stories.

Okay, where's Allie?
I know she's here.

I put a spy app
on her phone,

and I'm not proud of it,
but I'm a jealous woman.

Oh, her phone.
I have it.

She left it at The High
when I threw her ass out today

per your instructions.

I don't know
how I thought this thing

was gonna work out
to begin with.

We met at Coachella.

We were both on Molly,
this intensely hot

Filipino girl.

- Shh, shh.
- I'm hearing sexual sounds.

And hints of secret shame
coming from the bedroom.

- Allie is here.
- No, no one's here.

That's just
our white noise machine.

I'm shocked.
You're not even her type.

Your lips are like
two flair-pen marks.

[Nashit laughs]

That's hot.

Please
don't fire Nashit!

The Dr. Seuss hats
were my idea.

We were playing
Hop on Pop.

I was Pop.

I didn't even know
there was a boy in there.

I only saw you.

Okay, since there are
no hookups at The High,

if you don't stop sleeping
with him immediately,

my new manager...

[clicks tongue]

Caroline here
is gonna have to kick

his beautiful butt
to the curb.

But I was
mid-doing-it!

Honey, there's
a real funky smell in here.

I got to get out
of here.

PS, this is where
you live?

Take another $100.

Earl, hi.

What kind of mood
is Max in?

Pretty good.

On the Max scale,
she's below slightly drunk

but above punching
a customer out.

Oh, good.

I was worried
she'd be mad at me

'cause I had to get rid
of her boy toy.

Caroline, I'd put
my hearing aids back in

if I wanted
to hear a story.

Guess what I have
for you in my purse.

The tampon
I asked for last week?

No, and again,
so sorry about that.

Really dropped
that ball.

Gummy worms.

Yes, I took away
your man candy,

but I got you these,
the hot ones that you like

from the good candy store
with the sneeze guards.

[gasps]

Fancy.

And don't worry
about Nashit.

I got him
another job.

Hot worm!

Clean glasses
coming through.

Nice rack.

Now I know why guys
like saying that to me.

There he is!

There's
the new employee.

(Caroline)
Han, I can't believe
you would hire someone

just 'cause Max
asked you to.

This has nothing
to do with Max or you.

The boy here
said something to me

that you two
couldn't understand.

What's that, sir?

That I was
a hard worker?

That's it!
Yes!

Manna from heaven.

I actually have
an employee who works.

Jealous?

Now, this job,
I can do.

You know, growing up,
I had five brothers and sisters,

and since I was
the least attractive,

I had to clean
all the dishes.

Meet you
in the dish room, Nashit.

Max, what
are you doing?

There may not be
hookups at The High,

but there are hookups
here at our lowest low,

and we are doing it.

Caroline likey.

Pick up... chicken breasts.

The way I know you want it,
with the bone in.

We really should
hold a seminar

about sexual harassment
in the workplace.

Why? He's already
so good at it.

I'm serious.
How'd he like it

if we did that to him
every time we ordered?

Well,
let's find out.

Ordering.

One pastrami.

Can you do me a favor,
doll-face?

Make it so big and thick, you
can't get your mouth around it.

Can you do that
for me?

Yes,
and two matzo ball soups,

hold the balls.

Wait,
I'll hold the balls,

you just sit there
and look pretty.

And a cream of...

nope, can't.
Just grossed myself out.

When is it
going to get dirty?

Max, come out.

If I came out,
it would not be for you,

it's be for that
hot dragon tattoo girl.

Welcome, board members,
to the very first

financial assessment meeting
of Max's homemade cupcakes.

I was told
there would be a cheese plate.

After five months
in business,

we're showing a profit
of $725.

I have to say,
I'm a little disappointed.

Really? 'Cause, dude,
we have so far exceeded

where I thought we'd be
in five months.

Look, we have to find a way
to make more money on the side

to put into the business.

Or we could quit now,
while we're a success.

What are you
talking about?

It's only
gonna get worse.

Or it could get better.
Why would you even say that?

Because it's life, and life
gets worse, that's what it does.

On life's resume,
under special skills it says,

"good at
making things worse."

- Do you always go to
the worst-case scenario?

Do you think you could try
to be more optimistic,

and not expect the worst
all the time?

Who's that?
More optimistic, right?

On the other side of that door
is all the money you lost,

and then we move back
into your townhouse,

and I masturbate in your tub
for a change.

It was twice,
and you could have knocked.

Who is it?

Detective James, NYPD.

Wait, don't open it!
Don't open it!

Oh, smoked it tuesday.
Open.

Sorry to bother you, miss.
Do you live in this apartment?

I'm gonna tell you right now,
officer,

our names
aren't on the lease.

We're an illegal sublet
with no place else to go.

Please, mercy.

Sorry, officer,
it's her first raid.

Relax, the landlord
didn't send me.

What do you know about

the tenant who lives in the
apartment directly above you?

His name is Lou.

Leo?

Saul?

Am I even close?

His name's
Nirham Chaduri.

Oh, man, I wasn't even
on the right continent.

Is that Nirham Chaduri?

Been dead for two weeks.
Lived alone, nobody knew.

Cats eat his face?

Max, could you please
not be so dark?

Kittens eat his face?

What? I'm just trying to put
a more positive spin on things.

Where are you going
with that?

That's my good China
with huckleberry hound on it.

I'm making
a "hello" cupcake plate

for our neighbors
across the hall.

Oh, no, you're not.

It's weird
not to know your neighbors.

No, it's weird
not to know your father,

but by the time you're four,
you get over it and move on.

This is a mistake.

Who knows what's lurking
behind that door?

Yes, something awful,
like nice people,

who might look out for us,
or say, "hello," in the hallway

when they see you.

No matter what
comes out of there,

I will not be "hello-ing" it up
in the hallway.

You got lucky.
Get back in here.

Who is it, please?

- Caroline,
your next-door neighbor.

Hi.

Uh, is this a bad time?

Not at all.

One sec.
Hi.

I just wanted to introduce
myself and my roommate, Max.

There, and give you
these cupcakes.

That is so nice.

Well, it's the leash...
least... least I can do.

Well, I gotta go.

Well, if we ever get a dog,
we know who can walk it.

- Listen.
- I know.

It's only been
a few days,

and somebody's already moved in
upstairs.

And they are
playing music!

Music is coming
through the floor into my ears.

I blame you for this.

When you knocked on that door
across the hall,

you might have
opened a portal to hell.

There, you hear
the devil music?

I think
it's the bee gees.

Exactly.

And walking!

Walking and music,
we have to stop this right now.

It's 10:00, people are allowed
to walk and play music.

Your lack
of apartment knowledge

is really starting
to piss me off.

We have to show him right now
not to screw us.

I need paper.

- What are you doing?
I mean, besides over-reacting?

Writing
a threatening note.

If we don't shut this down now,
next thing you know,

someone's having
an academy awards party

in your living room.

Is that what you want?

Strangers passing out
mini Oscar statues

that say, "best nachos?"

"I have
an unregistered gun

and can shoot you
through the floor"?

You're coming in
really hot, Max.

We're not giving him this.

It'll start a bad dynamic
between us.

God, how I miss
the quiet, dead indian guy.

Okay, we're gonna
hit and run.

Oh, you mean
"run," literally.

Shh, listen.

Reading the note,

freaking out...

Music off,
problem solved.

Respect!
Never doubt, never doubt.

Crossing the floor
to the door,

Closing the door,

Coming down the stairs,

What do we do?

Move?

What's he look like?

He's got his finger
over the peephole.

Okay, game on. Back up!

This is my building,
I've got to take it back.

- Max, this is life, not
call of duty: Modern warfare 3.

Move.

What is meaning
of this horrible, horrible note?

Oh, you're not a man?

What kind of question
is this?

Do I look like a man?

No, but you clump around
up there like a man.

Max, please.

Did you write
this horrible, horrible note?

I did.

First day
in my new home

and I'm given this horrible,
horrible note, with threats.

Well, they're not
actually threats.

"I will gut you
like a hog."

To be clear,
I only skimmed the note.

Everything was happening
so fast.

Listen, we've obviously
gotten off to a bad start.

Please come in.

Why would I want to come in
with you horrible, horrible...

ooh, cupcake land.
Ooh.

Yes, we have
a cupcake business.

We're just starting,
but doing well.

Max is the baker.
Say hello, Max.

I know people
in the mob.

That's Max, and I'm Caroline.
You are?

Sophie Kuchenski.

Is that a polish accent
I'm detecting?

Yes.

I visited Warsaw once,
I love it.

Oh, 'cause I hate it.
Rats and pimps.

Why have you
not yet offered me cupcake?

It's the least thing you can do,
after horrible, horrible note.

Oh, sure.
Chocolate or vanilla?

Yes.

Why such sourpuss?

Sorry about that.
It's just, we work long hours

at the neighborhood diner,
and Max has another job as well,

and then she comes home and
she has to make the cupcakes.

Mmm.
So good.

Mmm.

How could someone so angry
make something so sweet?

She's not always
like this.

I'm usually like this,
just ask the previous tenant.

Oh, wait.
You can't.

You know, you two girls
are like these cupcakes.

One is dark and heavy
and one is light and fluffy.

I prefer the fluffy one.

Well, I think we've
made our point.

No music, no clumping,
I'll shoot you

through the floor,
thanks for stopping by.

I'm so glad we can
joke with each other already.

Sorry about the note,
can we start ov...

you have
the chanel allure lip gloss?

Yeah.

Mm, you know the chanel?

Know? Love.
I can't afford it any more.

Oh, take one.
I got handfuls in my bag.

Really?

Oh, that's so nice.

Both: Ahh.

Hey.

Hey! Hey!

Do I have to put you
on a leash?

Hey, we start again.

You take a chanel,
and I take more cupcakes to go.

Oh, sure.

Yes.

I knew it.
Bitch played us for cupcakes.

It's 3:00 A.M.
Why are you dressed?

Never took off my clothes,
'cause soldiers don't.

We have to be ready
when the enemy attacks.

Okay, you were right,
I was wrong.

Why do you have the broom?

'Cause I ran out
of finger bullets.

Wait, you're gonna fall.

I can't believe
we have a broom.

All this time I've been sweeping
with an us weekly.

I knew this would happen,
but I didn't say anything,

'cause you were all, "Max is
the worst-case scenario."

Well, we showed weakness
and now, look.

And by "we,"
I mean "you."

Deal with this,
cupcake thief!

Yeah, one more time,
and hard.

Okay, now she broke our house.
We're in a war.

She wants a piece of me,
she's gonna get it.

Where are my heels?

I mean,
who did she think I am?

Someone she can just buy off
with a tube of chanel?

Well, your legs
did kind of snap back

over your head pretty quick
when she offered it.

I thought you were
man with pizza.

You have a porch swing
in there.

You have
an electric cigarette.

What is it
you two girls want?

Uh, I forgot.

Just so thrown by the swing
and the everything.

Oh, you're taking advantage
of us

by still playing that music
after we talked.

You two are harshing
my marshmallow.

So I'm gonna have to call
my friend the landlord tomorrow

and tell him about
the horrible, horrible note.

Mmm.

Oh, my God,
she's a hooker.

I've been using
a hooker's lip gloss.

She's not a hooker.

Oh, good.

She's too old,
she's a madame.

You've been using
an old hooker's lip gloss.

Max, look, my lip.

Is this something?
I feel like I'm getting one.

For the last time,
you cannot get a herpes breakout

in under ten hours.

- You're right, now I'm jumping
to the worst-case scenario.

Maybe her lip gloss
wasn't a herpes breeding ground.

Maybe she's not a prostitute.
Maybe those young girls

weren't being held there
against their will.

Yeah, maybe she just
has sleepovers

with women on swings
in the their nighties.

You know,
like people do.

Welcome
to Williamsburg diner.

How many in your party?

What kind of question
is this?

One,
I am my own party.

I take booth.

Now, now, who is that
over there?

Our new
upstairs neighbor.

Earl, does she look
like a prostitute to you?

Well, I don't like to
judge a book by its cover,

but if she was a book,

she'd be the kind
that other books pay for sex.

Sophie just came in,
Earl thinks she's a hooker,

and now my lip is feeling
very courtney love.

I invited her here
for a free meal,

we have to make this work out
for us.

Last night, she threatened to
call her "friend," the landlord,

and that can
never happen.

We're illegal tenants,

and I'd rather have a noisy roof
over my head than no roof.

Let me do the talking.

You're too upset, and you might
say something insulting.

Like what?
"Hi, thanks for the lip gloss

"and the series of
uncomfortable conversations

with every lover I'll have
for the rest of my life."

You don't need
to tell them,

they'll figure it out
eventually.

Hi, thanks for coming in.

I like the uniforms.

You fill out
the front nicely,

and you with no boobs,
short-short skirts.

Smart girls.

Uh, we just wanted to
offer you a free dinner,

as our way of
apologizing.

So are you ready
to order?

What kind of question
is this?

Did you see
this horrible, horrible menu?

We can't have
nice conversation here.

Tomorrow I take you
to nice place, my treat.

Oh, you don't have
to do that.

No, no, I, too,
want to apologize.

You know, after you two left
the other night,

some of my girls said
that I was harsh on you.

Yes, all those girls
work for me.

Excuse me, I have to go
to the ladies' room right now

and look at my lips.

Thank you so much
for inviting us.

Are you enjoying
that beluga?

Mmm, so much. Thank you.

I haven't had caviar
in forever. Mmm.

Legs over your head much?

So, sourpuss,
you don't like caviar?

No, I'm more of
a cheeseburger kind of girl.

- Oh.
- This place is busy.

The waiters must
make a fortune.

Oh, yeah,
300, 350 a night.

What do you girls make?

60 to 80
on a good night.

And how do you expect you will
accomplish cupcake business

on money like this?

Well,
we're just starting out.

Yes, but at this rate,
it will take forever.

You know, I, too,
have big dream.

I am building summer house
by lake in Poland.

You want to see?

Oh, you have pictures?

No, I have house.

This is model
from the architect.

And I take it everywhere I am,
to remember where I'm going.

It's cool.

See, girls like you
should be making more money.

Maybe you could consider
coming to work for me.

- Sophie!
- Oh.

Thank you for sending girl
to my apartment yesterday.

Oh, did she do the job?

Oh, like no one
ever before.

Down on all fours,
under, over,

under again.
Oh!

Well, my girls don't leave
until you're satisfied.

Maybe she can come
two times a week.

She can come
whenever you want her to come.

Are these
two of your girls?

Well, we were just
discussing that.

Well, this one here looks like
she can take a lot.

Uh, thanks?

My friend Yanni
is at the bar.

Since his divorce, he's
in great need of your service.

Prosze.
Oh, yes.

Uh, excuse me, and, um,
don't touch my house.

I can't believe
she would actually consider

asking us
to be prostitutes.

I know.

I mean, me, I get,
but you, I don't see it.

You heard the guy, I look like
I could "take a lot."

Max, it's not funny.

Isn't it bad enough I may have herpes

from her chanel gloss?

Of course we're not
gonna do it, but come on,

you'd be
a terrible hooker.

Thank you,
I would be a terrible hooker.

I have a heart, and soul,
and dreams,

and want to fall in love
and have a family.

Oh, just say it,
you're bad in bed.

Let's get out of here.

I mean, really,
who does she think I am?

Someone who would just
sell myself to have nice things?

Let me just suck down a little
more of this, and we're off.

If we
walk out of here now,

we can just keep walking
to the homeless shelter.

Well, I'd rather be homeless
than a hooker.

Here she comes.
Sit down!

Let's thank her
and politely decline.

Okay, back to
what we were discussing.

Uh, thanks.

We appreciate the offer,
but we are going to pass.

So you don't want to
accomplish your dream?

Well, uh, I'm not exactly sure
those two things line up,

but thanks.

I thought you were smart girls.

We are smart girls,

and smart girls
don't have to sell their bodies

to accomplish their goals.

Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

It works for you, but us?

Well, she's bad in bed
and I have a sour puss.

What guy wants to pay for that?

You think
I am prostitute?

No, everyone has swings
with girls in pajamas.

My business card.

Home cleaning service.

She runs
a cleaning company.

"Sophie's choice."

You realize
what this means?

- We insulted
a hard-working woman

who was trying to help us
attain our goal?

Yes.

And I don't have herpes!

I should have
listened to you.

Meeting neighbors
is a big mistake.

And meeting neighbors
and calling them a prostitute?

Bigger mistake.

Plus, we have to kick in
60 for the check.

What can we
possibly say to her?

That we're sorry, and please
keep playing the bee gees

day or night
as loud as she wants.

Not a good idea
to be smiling right now.

I'm just so happy
I don't have herpes.

Hi, is this
a bad time?

Yes. Yes, I'm in the middle of
having sex for money

with every man
in Brooklyn.

What do you horrible,
horrible girls want?

Here, you left
part of your dream on the table.

And we want
to apologize.

I'm new at this whole
being neighborly thing.

What does the fluffy one
have to say?

Thank you for being
so generous,

and for offering to help us
make more money

to accomplish our dream.

And this is supposed
to make me feel better?

You called me prostitute.

Actually,
it's kind of a compliment

that we thought
you were stunning enough

that men would pay
to have sex with you.

This is true.

Come on in.

♪ Thinking about
those people... ♪

Saturday night fever
is my favorite movie.

Look at him.
He's so sexy.

He's not that cute,
kind of oily.

You're right.

She would have made
terrible prostitute.

That's a nice TV.

Yeah, brand-new.

I have all my girls over
the other night

for viewing sleepover party.

It's also 3-d.

- Does it come with
3-d glasses?

Yeah,
in the drawer there.

- Here.
- Max, it's not a 3-d movie.

- Who cares?
It's 3-d glasses.

Come on,
you're always talking about

wanting us to see things
differently.

Oh, so cool.

This swing
is a brilliant idea.

Yeah, it's for my porch
at lake house.

But why wait?

Dream is now.

♪ Ha-a-ah ♪

♪ More than a woman ♪

Hey, Earl.

You girls are back from Hollywood already?

Time sure does move fast.

We haven't left yet.

Time sure does move slow,

especially when you are
as high as I am right now.

There's a car waiting out
front to take us to the airport.

The only thing better than a town car

is a getting-out-of-town car.

And I came in to say

there's a car waiting for me out front,

and it's not a police car!

Ha!

I knew you two weren't going to LA.

I knew you were just pulling my chain.

You know, when I pull your chain,

you go, "Whoo-hoo-hoo."

No studio would fly you two cross-country

just to discuss a movie about Caroline

losing all her money.

That's almost as funny
as that time Caroline said

she reported the diner
to the health department.

Which reminds me, Han,
there's something here for you

from the health department.

Han, we really are going to LA.

In fact, they're already
talking to the Keebler Elf

about playing you in my movie.

It's between him and the Asian daughter

from "Modern Family."

Ha!

This is almost as funny
as that time Max said

she registered me as a sex
offender down at city hall.

Han, there's also something
here for you from city hall.

Girls, what happened?

Are you on the no-fly list too?

You hide a six-pack of
batteries in your junk once,

and you're grounded for life.

Let's just go and never look back.


Oh, my God.

This can't be our room.

This is so sweet.

Is that why they call it that?

Terrace! Terrace!

Staircase! Staircase! Oh, my God.

Take a picture before they
realize there's been a mistake

and put me back in coach.

These are the only 12 steps
anyone's gonna get me to take.

Now me. Now me. Terrace. Terrace.

The view.

Oh, I need to get a
picture of me with the view.

This is so awesome.

Our view at home is
just a painting of a view

in the neighbor's apartment.

Oops, careful of that railing.

Three out-of-work
actresses "slipped and fell"

from there last pilot season.

One fall is an accident, three an epidemic.

Ooh, look. We each get a pet.

Well, I'm Lawrence, the
hotel's general manager.

I upgraded you.

You were supposed to be in
a room with two queens...

well, three if I was in it.

Thank you so much, Lawrence.

That's really amazing of you.

But why would you upgrade us?

Are you nuts?

That's like asking a teacher
if there's weekend homework.

Well, I heard you were
in LA for a movie meeting,

and, well, keep me in mind.

Absolutely.

For what?

A part.

I'm also an actor.

I'm very versatile.

I can play a gay dad, a gay executive,

a gay priest.

Is there any other kind?

I can also play straight.

Just ask my ex-wife Beth.

But she really should have suspected.

We would get into such
knockdowns about the pesto.

- Lawrence, I'm confused.
- About what?

Gay guys care a lot about pesto.

Aren't you the hotel's general manager?

Yep, for the last 20 years,
until I get my big break.

So keep me in mind.

Also, Ms. Black, your
luggage is still lost,

like me in my early f... thirties.

Enjoy the place. It's all yours.

This is Lawrence.

The place is all ours!

The place is all ours!

Hi. You have to get out...

For about an hour.

Go eat. It's almost dinnertime.

I'll put your name on the
list at our restaurant.

And I'm sorry about this.

It's just that I have an A-list movie star

who wants to have an "impromptu
private meeting" here.

Is this like a Travolta
masseuse kind of thing?

I said "A-list."

Lawrence said we were on a list,

so why are we still stuck out here?

And don't blame my smelly
shirt, because Johnny Depp,

who's sitting over there, smells way worse.

Why are you two still at the bar?

Didn't you speak to Claude?

Which snotty gay guy is he?

Look, not everyone in this hotel is gay.

But Claude is
hands-down-my-pants the gayest.

I also came to apologize
for asking you for a part...

without showing you my reel.

Come with me.

The Wi-Fi's better by that fountain

that Whoopi Goldberg peed in.

I'll be right back, Max

I have a feeling his reel is real short.

- Ooh, Claude? Are you Claude?
- Mm.

I'm sorry you had to
be a baby named Claude.

I'm on the list.

- Name?
- Max Black.

No.

Yes, Max Black.

Uh, no.

Yep, that's me, Caroline Channing.

I'm with her. We're here together.

No.

Dude, don't make me hit you.

Max.

Max Black. Max, over here.

Claude, she's with me.

Very good.

Just so you know, I'm not a hooker.

Oh, I know.

Prostitutes don't have such a tough time

getting past the maître d' here.

I'm Randy.

Sit?

And what makes you think
I would need to hire

a hooker to have dinner with?

Oh, I didn't think you were a john.

I thought you were a pimp.

- Not a pimp.
- Uh, not buying it.

Who else would wear five silver rings?

Every straight guy in LA over 40?

Wow, not a pimp, not gay.

You're really putting
it all right out there.

You have to be from New York.

No, Brooklyn,

New York City's trashy
little cousin with hep C.

Wow, hooker, hep C.

You're really putting it all out there.

Can I buy you a drink?

A house?

There you are.

Hi. I'm Caroline. I'm...

- Leaving.
- What?

Go. I just got bumped up to first.

Livin' in LA and lovin' my life.

Hi, Sophie. How are you?

Oh, not too good.

Yeah, I thought I called Max's phone.

Is that the adoption agency?

Did you tell them we liked that couple

who didn't plan on a 14th?

No, it's not the agency.

I called to talk to
Max, but I got Caroline's

"my life doesn't suck anymore" podcast.

Well, Sophie, Max isn't here.

She met this really cute guy...

Max already got laid!

That's why I love LA.

Hey, way back in the day, I
was all up and down the Strip.

Now I'm excited if I
get up and down the step.

Sophie, Max didn't come home last night,

but we don't know that she got laid.

Oh, she did...

By a lawyer.

And the verdict is in: Hot.

Hey, Max, how hung was his jury?

Sophie, I have to go.

We have a meeting at the movie studio.

Call you later, Max.

I want details.

Helmet or turtleneck?

Oh, my God. I'm exhausted.

From all the sex?

No, we went on a hike this morning.

LA hookups are so healthy.

You exercised? Outside?

Oh, you must really like this guy.

Well, I've never had sex with a lawyer

that wasn't court-appointed.

I'm so happy for you.

And he's a lawyer?

What, like, an entertainment lawyer?

Yep, he handles Bradley
Cooper, Nicole Kidman,

George Clooney, and... my Clooney.

Morning. Got news about your luggage.

- It's here?
- No.

Like a young me, it's stuck in Detroit.

Perry Tyler's office. This is Quan.

Oh, hi.

Yes, absolutely, set in stone.

We're so excited.

So not happening.

But our meeting with Mr. Tyler

that was scheduled for 20 minutes ago,

that's still happening, right?

Absolutely. Set in stone. We're so excited.

- Ooh, I got a text.
- No, it's me.

Oh.

Max, I can't believe it.

You're hoping the lawyer calls.

I've never seen you hope for anything.

I thought he'd call.

I kind of liked him.

I went outside in the daytime.

Nina's on her way in.

You know, she's the
executive who discovered me

at that storytelling show.

I'm running behind, so
you need to order me lunch.

I want a kale salad with a side of kale

and a kale shake, and tomorrow
better book me a kale-onic.

Caroline, what are you doing?

You're dressed all wrong.

Yours is a "riches to rags" story,

a story we'll never sell if
you go in there wearing that.

I have a huge hole near the crotch

in my panty hose, if that helps.

It doesn't.

You need to look broke,
busted, discarded from society.

Put on what she's wearing.

Fine,

as long as I don't have to
wear that stupid nurse cape.

That dress looks cute
on you, all three of you.

I know. Ugh, look at this.

It's like my first day of kindergarten.

Hi.

It's been two hours. Is he maybe ready yet?

Absolutely. We're so excited.

Fine, but these are about to blow.

So don't come crying to me when
you're blinded by boob buttons.

Something in your shirt is itching me.

Why is there a joint in your shirt?

I think that's obvious.

It fell down from my hair.

Good thing you found it and
not those TSA party poopers.

My phone. Where? Where it it?

Oh, I put it here in your front pocket.

Oh, cool, there's never
room there when I wear it.

See, Max, I knew he'd call you.

- Well, he said he would.
- And he will.

But right now, this is Sophie.

Hi, Sophie.

How's the adoption going?

Did you find a 16-year-old who
really let her parents down?

Hey, Earl, where is Oleg right now?

He just went to the men's room

with the bra ads from today's paper.

Okay, I have 45 minutes.

But the thing is,

I still want the baby to look like me.

Well you can put hair
extensions on anything.

Are you saying that I shouldn't adopt

and I should keep trying
to have my own baby?

Ohh, I've got go Sophie,
our 4:002:00 meeting is on.

That's a wrap for today, Quan.

Wait, he's just gonna leave

and not acknowledge our existence?

I can't believe this.

They're treating me
like they know who I am.

Mr. Tyler.

Hi, Caroline Channing.

We were supposed to have a meeting.

Quick refresher: Lost my billions

but not my plucky can-do
attitude against all odds.

I'm Max. I'm the odds.

Oh, yeah, you're the sad,
dejected, destitute girl.

That's me, the destitute girl.

So sorry. Today got away from me.

Ryan Murphy can talk.

I'll have my office call you tomorrow.

Call her?

Call her?

Why don't you just tell her the truth,

that she's never gonna hear from you,

the movie's never gonna
happen, and like every other man

in this town, you're full
of crap and silver jewelry.

Well, okay then.

So sorry to have kept you waiting.

Quan, set them up with
another appointment tomorrow.

And this is platinum.

He's really gonna meet with us, right?

Absolutely. Set in stone. We're so excited.

So never gonna happen.

What do we do now?

Well, as I said on my
first day of kindergarten...

it's recess.

There you are.

Drinking alone at a bar in the morning.

Did we switch bodies
when we switched clothes?

It's 5:00 somewhere.

Oh, my God. Maybe we have.

I just needed a few
sips to calm myself down.

Look, I'm really sorry I
lost it on that studio guy.

And I guess running behind his
car and begging didn't work.

Wow, even apologizing in LA is healthy.

There's still a chance; Nina's
meeting with Perry right now.

Maybe she'll smooth everything over,

like everybody does here with their faces.

Oh, Claude, hi, Caroline Channing.

Lawrence put me on the list for a table.

And I'm Max Black, your worst nightmare.

One moment.

So aggressive. What is the problem?

I'm guessing low self-esteem.

Not him. I'm talking about you.

I'm guessing low self-esteem.

Nina, hi.

I didn't realize your
meeting with Perry was here.

God, it's like everyone
in Hollywood is here.

Yes, for about another month.

Then this place will be as empty

as Keira Knightley's refrigerator.

So I just talked to Perry, and looks like

he was really offended by you yesterday.

Uh, I'm sure people have
said worse things to that man.

I mean, his license plate
says, "Makin' Movies."

Max, you can't have an attitude like that

and not get buried in Hollywood.

Nina.

Just ask Claude.

He used to run Paramount.

It's over?

I came all this way to be disappointed

by a rich guy in Hollywood?

I could have just seen a Kevin Hart movie.

I'm sorry.

I better go sign for these
drinks while they're still free.

Claude, Claude, look,

I know you and I haven't gotten along,

but quick fave.

I need to fix something for my friend.

Can I just go over there
and talk to that guy, please?

Are you on the list?

I've never been on the list.

I can do this all day, sweetheart.

I'm a gay rumba champion.

Hi, I'm Max. I'll be your server.

Today's soup is "please don't ruin"

my friend Caroline's
chance, it's all my fault."

And, of course, it's vegan, no dairy.

What's going on here?

Sir, I really screwed up,

and as I screamed into
your muffler yesterday,

I am here to beg your forgiveness.

I wasn't talking about you.

I meant, why is there bread on my table?

Give her another chance.

This is the first good
thing to happen to her

since she lost all her money,

aside from the time the
Red Cross gave us coffee.

At least meet with her,

so you can hear how amazing her story is.

It's a story of someone not being defined

by all the bad things that have
happened to them in the past

and just moving on.

I'd buy a ticket to that.

Perry, what's happening here?

Why is there bread on your table?

This girl keeps trying to convince me

to have a meeting with her friend.

I haven't seen a waitress this desperate

since Shannen Doherty slipped
me her head shot last night.

Well, as your lawyer,

I recommend you give her
exactly what she wants.

You won't be sorry.

I wasn't.

Come back tomorrow at 11:00.

You guys may have to wait,
but I'll squeeze you in.

Oh, my... thank you so much.

Now, I have to go find my friend

before she accidentally slips
and falls off the terrace.

Max, hold up.

That was really cool of you.

I'm not even upset anymore
that you didn't call me.

I didn't want to come on too strong.

Should I not have taken
dating advice from David Spade?

Ooh, I got to take this.

Of course you do.

Hello?

Hey, it's me.

Can I see you tonight?

Did you get that from David Spade?

That's all Stamos, baby.

And you're sure it's
not another fake meeting?

Because Quan called me to confirm,

and that makes me nervous.

Randy says the meeting's legit.

And turns out

you may have an LA BF.

Um, he is not my BF.

Because B stands for "boy,"
and that guy is a ma-an.

Good news about your luggage.

Like a young me, it arrived
in Los Angeles in one piece...

with a few holes in it.

This is you, right?

Sure looks like me.

Max, you packed your waitress uniform?

The weird thing is, I didn't.

I guess I'm never getting
away from that life.

Yes, you will. We're in Hollywood.

Anything can happen.

Oh, Lawrence, how did your audition go?

I didn't get it.

Oh, well, maybe it wasn't
the right role for you.

What was it?

The Filipino gay general manager of a hotel

who used to be straight.

Next one. You'll get the next one.

Well, now that your movie's
back on, keep me in mind.

I really am a good actor.

Like right now, I'm acting
like I'm not depressed.

Let's go out.

Let's do Hollywood stuff.

Let's go to the Observatory or
see where Biggie got murdered.

Okay!

Let me just grab something to wear.

Oh, my God. I hope that isn't Lawrence

saying that he needs the place for an hour

because Ben Affleck is here with a nanny...

Jude Law is here with a nanny...

Gavin Rossdale is here with a nanny.

Hi, girls.

Hey, we've got a lady that
looks like you at home.

Wow, nice room.

Sophie, what are you doing here?

Well, after Max talked me into

not adopting...

- I did?
- You did.

Well, I did a little research
on my Barnes and Noble Nook.

Do you want one?

I guess they're just
giving them away right now.

No, thanks.

I prefer to lie about the books I've read

the old-fashioned way.

Well, it turns out all of
these Hollywood actresses

that are having babies
over 40, like Geena Davis,

Jane Seymour, Neil Patrick Harris,

well, they're all going to
this big-shot healer out here,

so here I am.

It's cool if I stay with you, right?

- Absolutely.
- Set in stone.

We're so excited.


Earl, can I borrow
your paper?

I want to check my horoscope

to see if I'll still be
a whore in the future.

All right, who
wants to go first?

Ooh, do me. Do me.
Do me.

Can we have one night
at the diner

that doesn't end with you
yelling that at a woman?

All right, I'll go.

"Gemini, the twins,"

and they're both doing fine,
so let's move on.

Han, what sign are you?

I'm guessing
the 40-year-old Virgo.

Max, you don't need
that paper.

I'll tell you
what's in your future--

using my name as a reference
at chipotle.

You guys really believe
in that crap?

They just tell you
what you want to hear.

"You will be rich.
You will be famous."

You'd think I'd buy
a newspaper if it said,

"you will be
a 75-year-old cashier"?

(peter bjorn and John)
¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ¶

okay, ready to open?

Never have been,
never will be.

Let's do this.

Wait.

We have to do
our business affirmation.

Please, god, don't let us
be murdered in here.

All right,
let's open 'em up.

Oh, hell no.
- Max.

Hang on.
I wasn't done.

Oh, hell no!

Oh, she's yarn-bombing
that bike.

It's whimsical.
It's new.

It's stupid.

Graffiti, I get.

I see, "die, bitch. Die,"
on a wall,

I think, "okay,
this gentleman

wanted to get that
off his chest."

But this yarn-ival
is pathetic.

Yo, yarnie.

I have a name.

It's Guinevere.

Yep, that checks out.

What's happening
over here?

Why are you molesting
that poor bike?

Well...

I am beautifying the city

one living, glorious work
of art at a time.

And tips are always
appreciated.

[Scoffs]

Here's a tip:

Go back to school
and learn a trade

before daddy's money
runs out.

Well, I never--

worked a day in your life,
we know.

You think this
is artwork?

Artwork is a Garfield mug,
sweetheart.

You got Garfield
in a hammock, saying,

"I'm not overweight.
I'm under-tall,"

I'll build you a gallery
right here.

Look, you should
move on.

My friend doesn't
want you--

how shall I put this?

Taking a giant knit
in front of our shop.

What is the problem?
It is not even your bike.

It's been chained here
for, like, four months.

Oh, yeah?

Maybe it is our bike,

and we use it
for deliveries

and to trap nerds.

Peace out,
ganja beer,

before I knit you
a noose.

Max, that was
a great idea.

What, that she go back
to school?

I know.

At least a couple
night classes, right?

Get around
some people.

She's a lost cause.
Let's move on.

I'm talking about us
doing deliveries.

Why do we never deliver?

Speak for yourself.
I've delivered.

Seriously, Max, those
delivery services--

eat24, grubhub--
do big business.

No one wants
to go out now.

People are so lazy.

I don't really feel
like it.

Seriously, Max,
all we have to do

is slap a delivery charge
on that product,

and suddenly, a $5 cupcake
is bringing in more money.

And do you know what
more money means?

No.
How would I know that?

Okay, question:

Which of these goes
better with no pants?

I don't know.
They're both timeless...

As in, there's no time
you should wear those.

You can't be objective.

You're like a kid
in a candy store.

I'll ask Max.

Uh, well, the red one
kind of matches your rash.

I think we have a winner.

So why are you trying out
the fancy mesh tonight?

Well, even though Sophie and I
are getting back together,

we wanted to make it special
and hold off on the sexual part

of the relationship
until tonight.

That is so sweet.
- I know.

I haven't even masturbated since
right before I came in here.

So, Chestnut, I was buying
some rolling papers

at the bodega,

and I hope this is cool,
but I said they were for you.

Max, I have good news
and bad news.

The bad news is,

this is the only good news
I've had in three years.

And the good news is...

You found yourself
a new apartment?

don't toy with me, woman.

Speak plainly and clearly.

Did you find a new apartment?

Close your eyes.
I'll give you a hint.

Last time I was told
to close my eyes,

I woke up in a bikini
on a garbage barge.

P.S., closest I ever got
to a vacation.

[Horn honking]

Oh, you're dating a clown?

Please, you know
I would have told you

if I was dating someone
who had a car.

Look, it's the abandoned bike
from in front of the shop.

It was the bike from
the front of the shop.

Now it looks like a contestant
on rupaul's bike race.

We're gonna use it
to make deliveries.

I already signed us up
for three delivery services.

Still crazy smart.

Waste of time.

Amazon's got drones,

and we've got
one gay bike.

I don't want to do
deliveries.

I got this.
You bake, I'll bike.

And while you bike,
I'll get baked.

I'm just gonna knock out
these three "delivs,"

and I'll met you
at the cupcake shop.

"Delivs"?
You like "delivs"?

It's an "abbreve"
I made up for "deliveries."

You like "abbreve"?

It's an "ab" I made up
for "abbreviation."

I'm gonna make this short.
Get out.

Hey, everybody.

Sophie, what
do you think?

Aw, good for you,
Caroline.

I've been saying that
you should hop on something

pink and ride it
since I met you.

[Horn honking]

Ah, Max, I'm so glad
you're alone,

'cause I need some girl talk.

Okay, but the last time
I did girl talk,

I got $3
for the first minute

and $1 for each
additional minute.

No, it's about Oleg.

Last night,
he was unable to...

Oh, what's a nice way
to say this?

He couldn't get his soldier
to stand at attention,

and his penis
wouldn't work either.

Well, uh,
have you tried buying

a Cosmopolitan magazine
or something?

They usually have advice
on sex stuff

and how to hate your body.

Max...

You don't think it
could be me, do you?

No way, Sophie.
You are hot.

Ah.

The first time
Oleg saw you,

his soldier
not only saluted.

It exploded.

You're right.
I am hot.

It's all him.

Remember when I said you didn't
have to do deliveries?

You're gonna have to do
deliveries,

'cause I only went two blocks,

and I'm sweating
like shia lebeouf

at a dui checkpoint.

Okay, you deliver.
I'll open the window.

But first,
business affirmation.

Please, god, don't let us
get pistol-whipped in here.

It's either that Guinevere
or spider-man came out.

Caroline, can I talk to you
about a private matter,

by which I mean
the matter is my privates.

Okay, but hurry, Oleg.

I'm in the middle
of a dream catcher situation,

and it's a nightmare.

And why me?

'Cause I trust
and respect you

and I feel like you know
your way around a limp penis.

Maybe.

I talked to my therapist--

Roy, you know,
down at the Starbucks.

He told me it's all mental.

We didn't get
much further than that.

He spilled a grande mochaccino
on his sandals.

You're probably just scared.

Intimacy is so hard
for some guys,

it's not hard for some guys.

Yeah, that's
all over my head.

Oh, no,
Max forgot the order slips.

Oleg, I'm sure
it'll all work out.

Good luck getting your penne
al dente.

Again, over my head.

Max, what are
you doing?

What are you doing?

What am I doing?

Well, I think I'm
watching you shove

our delivery bike into
the back of an uber car.

Well, this is uber-awkward.

Come on, come on.
In or out.

All right, Caroline,
this is milesh, with a "k."

He doesn't go to the airport,

and he once drove
some of maroon 5--

so maroon 3.

No, stop.
Caroline.

If you want me to deliver
the cupcakes,

I can't use the bike,
I have to use the car.

Why?

Oh, my god,
are you pregnant?

You ask me that every day,
and almost every day I say no.

Look, I want to tell you,
but it's a secret.

And you can't tell anybody.

Do you seriously think
I would ever tell anyone

anything about this life?

Right.

I don't know
how to ride a bike, okay?

You don't know
how to ride a bike?

Max doesn't know
how to ride a bike?

Damn it, Caroline!

[Laughing]

Max doesn't know
how to ride a bike.

Oh, happy day.

I finally have
something over her.

There is a god,

and he's laughing
at her too.

Lordy, this is harder to watch

than Jim carrey in a drama.

[Laughing]

[Knock at door]

Max, are you up?

What's that smell?
Did you bring home Greek food?

No, that's me.

That's how you smell
after you ride a bike

all over williamsburg delivering
14 orders of cupcakes,

and I do not wish
to smell like this again,

so you have to learn how to ride
that bike, all right?

Who do you think you are
busting in here

smelling like hummus
but having no hummus?

What is the problem?

Didn't your mother ever teach
you how to ride a bike?

No, my mother was too busy
being the town bike.

Well, then I'll teach you.

Nope.
Never getting on a bike.

It's one of my three "nevers."

Yes, well,
your first "never" was,

"never having
a blonde roommate."

You are chipping away at me
piece by piece, lady.

I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what's going on.

I'd sit on your bed, but
that's your third "never."

[Sighs]

When I was little, there was
this kid, Tommy doonan.

Nice kid, solid hopscotcher.

Used to give me his fruit
roll-up at lunch every day.

Max, did he give you
these fruit roll-ups,

or did you take them?

don't interrupt.

One day, Tommy doonan
got a new bike.

He was out front
with this nice, older man

who looked just like him.

You mean his dad?

Mm, is that
what they call them?

I assumed it was a predator.

So anyway,
I was making fun of him

'cause he seemed happy.

I thought
that was our thing.

And he started showing off,
doing wheelies and stuff,

to put me in my place,

but then he flipped up
over the handlebars

and came down hard
on his face.

Sad,

but not worth me
having baklava pits.

Well, wait.

After I stopped laughing

and the man picked him up
and hugged him predator-style,

I saw Tommy's teeth
had busted through his cheek.

To put it plainly,

his mouth was
on the outside of his face.

Ew, that's like something
out of a horror movie,

like bike of the living dead
or Texas bike chain massacre

or--well,
that's probably enough.

Every time I see a bike,
I think of his little face

and his little teeth
chomping out the side of it.

He had to eat apples
like this...

[Babbling]

Max, you are not responsible
for that.

Yeah, I know,

and 1 out of the 12 jurors
agreed.

Thank you, number six.

Anyway, it freaked me out,
so good night.

No, Max.

It is not going
to work that way.

You're learning
how to ride a bike.

I'm already
on one painful cycle.

I don't want to get
on another one.

Max, I have access
to tootsie rolls,

and if you get on a bike,
I will give you four.

What am I, a chimp?

Five.
Let's go.

don't look so smug,
Chestnut.

You don't know
how to ride a bike either.

Come on, Max,
just out here in the alley.

Oh, hell no!

What?
- She's been back here too.

Who?
- Guine-queer.

There's so much yarn-bombing,
it's like craft-ganistan.

Max, let it go.

Stay focused.

Get on the bike.

No.

I don't want to eat apples

out of the side
of my face.

Come on.
Let me teach you.

Nope.
- Want a tootsie?

You know I do.

I mean, you taught me
how to be poor.

Eh, you're getting
really good at it.

Come on.

You know what they say
about riding a bike.

It's like riding a bike.
See?

It's fun, see?
Whee!

Whee, whee, whee, whee, whee!
Whee!

You got a real pretty mouth,
Caroline.

Can't wait to see it
on the side of your face.

At least just get
on the bike.

You don't even have to go
anywhere yet.

Nope.
Want a tootsie?

You know I do.

Go.

[Groans and scoffs]

What is this bar
doing here?

I have no use for a bar
that can't get me drunk.

Okay, walk the bike
over there

and lean against the car
to get your balance.

Just check and make sure
there's no one around.

Why do you care?

The only people out here
this late

would be rapists,
murderers, and freaks...

[Chuckles]
You know, your peeps.

(Max)
What the--

hey, girls.

Sophie?

What are you doing
in that car alone?

Oh, a dark alley
at 3:00 A.M.?

Has money gotten
that tight?

Yes, but that's not
why we're out here.

I'm teaching Max
how to ride a bike,

and it's pretty hard.

Oh, yeah, I wish
I had that problem.

I'm dancing
with a rope in here.

We're trying some
exotic, new locales

for our lovemaking.

It's exotic because
this isn't even our car.

(Sophie)
Oh, uh...

We better hurry before
that rabbi comes back.

Maybe try barking
at it again.

There was some
movement earlier.

[Sophie barking]

Come on, Caroline, teach me
how to ride this thing.

I got to get away
from temple gross shalom

as fast as possible.

Okay, I'm gonna get
behind you

and hold on to your seat.

Not without three
long island iced teas

and one, "your butt
looks good in those jeans."

Tootsie?
Yeah.

Max, don't look.

Yarn-bombing?

(Han)
Hey, Max.

(Max)
Han?

I'm just riding my bike
to the bike store

to buy more bikes.

Is that han or

Lance Armstrong's
runaway testicle?

Sorry, couldn't
hear you.

I was too busy knowing
how to ride a bike.

Damn it!
Now I got to do this.

You know how quickly society
will crumble around us

if han starts feeling like
he can freely tease me?

You sure?
- Yep.

Making fun of han

is one of my two free sources
of entertainment.

The other one is located
right above this bar.

Okay, I'll keep
my hand on the seat,

and then when you're ready,
tell me, and I'll let you go.

Okay, but don't let go
until I say so.

Okay, let go.

Already did.

I'm riding a bike?

Max, look out!
Pothole!

[Groaning]

There goes my other free source
of entertainment.

Tootsie?

Yes, obviously!

[Bell rings]
- Table ten. Pick up, Max.

Yeah, be right there.

Like, you know, in a month.

Uh, Max,
how you doing?

I heard about
your vag-accident.

Look, if you need
to see a doctor,

my cousin in Florida
is a good one,

but then again, the bumpy
bus ride might kill you.

No, no, it'll be fine,
Earl.

I'm icing it.
I just have to keep it cold.

We're out of ginger ale.

I think you mean the ginger ale
is out of you.

Max, let me
get that for you.

I feel like it was
kind of my fault.

Kind of?

Was Lincoln's death

kind of John wilkes booth's
fault?

[Bell rings]

Pick up, Caroline.

How'd it go with Sophie?

Were you able to do the thing,
you know, the man does

while the woman makes
shopping lists in her head?

Shh.
Come on.

I don't want anyone to know
I can't get it up.

Oleg can't
get it up?

[Laughing]

OMG. Oleg can't
get it up.

[Laughing]

Best week ever.

Hey, everybody!

What's up?

Not your boyfriend.

[Laughing]

If anyone needs me,

I'll be outside
riding my bike

with an erection.

Oh, no, no, no, no.
He didn't hear it from me.

I only told two people--

Max
and my manicurist, ming wa.

And you don't have to worry
about her

because she doesn't care
about anything

except loving some guy
named long time.

Sophie, baby,

this is hard.

Yeah, maybe we better not
try to be serious.

I mean, the real truth is,

I only like you
for your penis anyway.

Say that again.

What, that I only like you
for your penis?

One more time.

Well, what, that I don't have
any real feelings for you?

That it's completely sexual

and I only like you
for your big, stupid penis?

I'm back, baby.

Sophie, can I see you
in the kitchen?

And we better hurry.
I'm making three-minute eggs.

Cancel my eggs.

I would've so left during
that whole conversation,

but I'm holding a can
of Dr. pepper between my legs.

What? He's a doctor.
He's seen it.

Well, I think we're
pretty much even.

Your legs are a little sore,
and I'll never have children.

So I guess what
I'm saying is thanks.

So you really don't want
to get back on the bike?

You're just gonna give up?

I bet even Tommy doonan
got back on the bike.

Whatever happened to him?

I caught up with him
on Facebook.

Well, more like
really-messed-up-face-book.

He's happily married.

I bet right now
he's driving his car,

looking straight ahead,
and smiling at his wife

in the seat next to him.

So that's it for deliveries?

Oh, you can deliver
wherever and whenever you want,

but there is no way I am ever
getting on that bike again.

Max, look.
Guinevere.

Oh, hell no!

She yarn-bombed
our darn barn!

You two should've tipped.

I'm an artist.

Eat my stitches, bitches.

[Gasps]

That was not whimsical at all.

Give me the damn bike.

Knit's about to hit the fan.

[Can thuds]

Max, you're doing it.

What happened
to your fear of bikes?

I guess the only thing stronger
is my hatred of that nerd!

So it has been
quite a journey,

but through it all,
the key for me has been bravery

and the deep-down knowledge

that I am better
than everyone else.

Uh, I'm sorry, Jillian,
what was your question?

I asked Max
where she was born.

The Peekaboo Lounge
on I-90.

My mom was on the pole

when I popped out
and said, "Peekaboo."

So your movie,
 The Princess and the Ponzi,

has Oscar buzz...

for sound editing,
but still.

Who will you be wearing
to the premiere?

Well, Jillian,
the top is from

the 7-Eleven lost and found,

and the jeans I won
in a knife fight,

so I didn't get specifics.

Stylist to the stars
Brad Goreski reached out.

He's a fashion policeman,

the only kind of policeman
Max hasn't been arrested by.

Anyway, our dessert bar
is catering the premiere.

We are really
coming into our own.

Girls...

Oh, speaking of
coming into your own,

this is Han.

Are you coming
to work today?

Or should I just
write down wrong orders

for customers myself?

Han, can't you see
we're in the middle

of a press interview
for my movie?

You can't just ignore me.

I'm not the advice
of your court-appointed lawyer.

Sounds like you guys are busy.

The movie, running this bar,
and working for that man too.

Man, right?

With us blowing up as we are,

Max and I are
phasing out the diner

and deodorant
that's hot to the touch.

It burns the stink away.
I'm not giving that up.

Well, that was...five hours.

(chuckles)
Uh, see you at the premiere.

Wait,
we're phasing out the diner?

I have really gotta stop
falling asleep immediately

whenever you speak.

Max, think about it.
Why--

(snores)

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Han, we need to talk to you.

Yeah, we're not happy
about it either.

Best-case scenario,

we wouldn't have seen you
at all today.

Oh, good, a talk.

Let me save you the trouble
and just start crying.

Han, we are phasing
the diner out of our lives.

I have a stylist now.

This is our two weeks' notice,

and we need this week off
to get ready for the premiere.

I mentioned I have
a stylist, right?

So you leave me
high and dry?

I'm always high and dry
around you.

Han, we got
Bobby's sister, Denise,

to cover for us,
and she's already late.

It'll be like we never left.

(mouths word)

Whoo,
sorry I'm sweaty and late.

I tried to parkour my way here.

Then I met the business end
of a parking meter.

Basically, I broke my vagina.

Where can I get
a big Ziploc bag full of ice?

Uh...here.

I was keeping my kidney in it.

(upbeat music)

Now, Bobby,
before stylist to the stars

Brad Goreski gets here,

we just need to do
a little work

to fix up your clothes,
your hair, your face.

Also, your walk's not great.

How's my run?

'Cause I feel like
doing it right now.

If you want to play stylist,
help Denise.

She tucks her sweater in--
to her socks.

Oh, Denise isn't invited
to the premiere.

I can't run the risk of
being embarrassed by someone.

I mean, Earl already asked
if he could bring

his sleeping bag
and his shopping cart.

(groans)
We get it, Earl, you're rich.

(knocking on door)

Uh, my dress is by
Beddy Spready.

It's a bedspread.

(gasps)
Oh, my God, Brad Goreski!

Well, I can't prove it,

because someone just stole
my wallet outside.

All right,
I gotta go get a suit

after I get my...

eyelashes highlighted?
Seriously?

Love you.

both: Mm.

Love you too.

Good call on the eyelashes.

MAX: (gasps)
Ooh!

First time there's been

a better rack than mine
in the apartment.

Okay, these are the choices.

They're on loan
from the top designers,

and if you hurt them,

those bitches
will hunt you down.

Well, if Federal Marshal
Tommy Lee Jones

couldn't find me, good luck.

That's a brand-new
Zac Posen.

He gave it to me as a favor,

because we share a time share
and a love of Cher.

Over share?

You got anything over there

I won't have to
shave my pits for?

Hmm, hold on.

Let me sniff around

for Shailene Woodley's
SAG Awards dress.

Oh, my God, I love it.

Oh, good eye.

That's a $10,000 dress.

And that's why
it looks so lost

and afraid in this apartment.

$10,000?

I can own and operate
an Old Navy for that.

Oh, my God.

Did someone call fashion 911?

The fashion police are here!

Well, this is embarrassing.

Yes, I'm celebrity stylist
Brad Goreski.

Oh, see, I thought
you were Melissa Rivers.

Yeah, 'cause you guys
have very similar jaws.

Hey, do you style babies?

'Cause I want Barbara
to be discovered

at the movie premiere.

The only baby I style
is Kanye West.

Wait, are you sure
you're not Melissa Rivers?

(rock music)

(gasps)

Max, this is my reintroduction
into high society,

and you had to bring ribs
for the limo?

(scoffs)

Somebody obviously
was never in a Pitbull video.

Doesn't look like we're
going anywhere in this traffic.

I'll take a road rib.

(gasps)

Max, if you get
that red wine near me,

I will start singing songs
from Funny Girl,

and I will not stop.

-(sighs)
-Can I some of that

"deal with Caroline" juice?

(gasps)

(sighs)

Max, that's your third sigh.

Is my makeup not perfect?

Do even my sighs
have to be about you?

Well, it is my night.

I was just thinking
how this whole movie thing

started in L.A. with Randy.

It's kind of sad
he's not here,

and also, your makeup
is a little clowny.

Oh, no.

Yeah, well,
Randy's the only person

I've ever loved
or let love me.

How clowny?

(knocking)

What are you guys
doing out there?

We hopped out of our cab,
because of the traffic.

Also, it was on fire.

Well, we'd invite
you guys in here,

but the windows
keep going up on their own.

*

(elevator bell dings)

CAROLINE: (gasps)

You don't think
that limo driver's

gonna eat the rest
of my coleslaw, do you?

Shh, no one says "coleslaw"
on a red carpet.

I think you hid it
pretty well in the cup holders.

Oh, my God.
Look at all this.

Oh, good, Caroline Channing.

Stay here.
It's not your time yet.

Oh, that's what
the angels said to me

when I drove that dump truck
into the East River.

(elevator bell dings)

(gasps) Oh, look,
it's the star of Happy Feet.

Antarctica's that way.

No, it's that way.

This is exciting.

I haven't seen
this much paparazzi

since I was dating
Harriet Tubman.

You guys must be
the Make-A-Wish couple.

Actually,
we're just friends.

If I had a wish,
he'd be a giant doobie.

Just keep it moving.

It's the "Kevin Dillon
and below" spot.

(camera shutters clicking)

HAN: They must all be
reloading their cameras.

Are you trying to say
I shouldn't be seeing

all these flashing lights
right now?

(elevator bell dings)

Hey, everybody!

Check out my red carpet dress.

(giggles)

So, when I said
"red carpet attire,"

I meant something--wow.

I vacuumed it myself
before we left.

It gave me hard wood.

Well,
the real star tonight is here.

(gasps)
Verne Troyer, where?

No, Barbara.

Come on, Barbara,
let's make you a star.

Look, it's kielbasa,
your favorite.

Hey, everybody!

It's baby Barbara.

Here are some headshots.

She's cute, she's versatile,
and like her mother,

she can put
all ten toes in her mouth.

(elevator bell dings)

There you are.

Oh, let's hold off a minute.

Old Hollywood rule:
never follow sausage.

-Okay, who's next?
-Oh, I'll go.

Following sausage
is kinda my thing.

(camera shutters clicking)

Doesn't matter what you do
if you're rocking the cleavage.

Thanks for lending him clothes.

I told him to get
something cool,

so he bought
a short-sleeved suit.

Yeah, it's part of the
Steven Seagal summer collection.

Hey, are we ready?

Yeah.

You look so handsome.

Let me just fix that hair.

It's still doing
that thing that I hate.

Actually, it might just be
the shape of your head.

Walk a little in front of me.

I want to share
this moment with you,

but I want to do it alone.

-Okay.
-Okay.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, Bobby.

-No, Bobby--Bobby, wait!
-I'm going, I'm going.

I'm moving as fast as
my big misshapen head'll go.

-(screaming)
-Caroline, you're unraveling!

CAROLINE: Bobby, come back!

Oh, Bobby, no, I'm serious!

(camera shutters clicking)

Aah! I can't believe
this is happening!

And Bobby's hair
is still sticking up!

Oh, my God,
this is worse than

Eric Stonestreet's
nip slip.

-Max...
-(gasps)

Randy.

Max.

I'd...
love to stay and talk,

but I just remembered
I have to run away.

Brad, a little help?

You're on your own.

(elevator bell dings)

Stupid showing up at movies,

like, "Oh, surprise, Max,
I'm here."

(sighs)

(groans)
Sorry, we're closed.

You ran out of there
so fast,

you trampled that
strange exotic bird.

That was Tilda Swinton,
and I apologized.

How did you know I was here?

I followed you.

You could've just
poked me on Facebook.

Rather poke you in person.

So...you gonna give me a drink?

Are you gonna give me
a reason you're here?

Are you gonna give me
a reason you're so beautiful?

Are you gonna
give me a reason--

okay, fine,
I'll give you a drink.

(groans)

I just got over you.

What do you want from me?

I want to be with you.

(derisive laughter)

Oh, please!

You think you can just
come in here in your suit

and be like,
"Uh, I wanna be with you, Max."

You say you love me,

you say you can't live
without me,

and then you go
and live without me.

You, sir, are unreliable.

Max, I miss you.

Every time I see Cheeto dust

or a girl wearing flip-flops
in an expensive restaurant,

I tear up.

Oh, really?

I thought you said long-distance
relationships didn't work.

Not gonna be
long distance anymore.

What about your firm in L.A.?

We just opened offices
in New York.

Where are they?

Two blocks from
my new apartment I just got.

Well, where's your dog?

Doesn't he have season tickets
to the Lakers?

He and Jack Nicholson
got in a fight.

Well, what about
all that stuff you said

about us being in
different places in our lives?

I want to be in your place.

What about that thing you said

about the way I eat noodles?

I'm working on that.

Max, I've been crazy about you
since the moment I met you.

I don't want to live
without you.

-Oh, really?
-Really.

Prove it.

Max George Black...

I love you.

Will you marry me?

(laughs)
Wait, what?

Caroline can really
put you to sleep

on and off the screen, huh?

Here.

Oh, she doesn't
even like her desserts.

Well, at least you got a nap
out of it, right, Barbara?

You were the one who was
drooling pretty hard in there.

You know what?
After seeing that snoozer,

I don't want Barbara to have
any part of Hollywood.

Yeah.

You know, she can be
something important,

like a realtor.

(mouths words)

BOBBY: All right,

I stitched it up
with a rubber band

and a fisherman's knot
right there.

Yeah, Steven Seagal has
a dress just like that.

Bobby, how am I gonna pay
for this dress I ruined?

Do you have $10,000?

I can give you $4

and make you another
fisherman's knot.

I just really
want you to know

that I am sorry for the way
I've been acting.

Look, I know.

You have been
really nervous about today,

and it brought out what
I hope is the worst in you.

I'll just say yes.

Anyway, none of that
superficial stuff matters.

What matters
is that I love you,

and I owe $10,000
for this dress.

Just a heads-up.
I see London, I see...

Your whole left
butt cheek is out.

(gasps)

I may have a solution
to your $10,000 problem.

I am not going in on

that Little Caesar's franchise
with you.

We'd be making more than pizza,
I'll tell you that.

Look, I'm flush with cash now

that they've stopped
making Dr. Who figurines.

How about
if I pay for the dress,

you and Max can pay me back
by working at the diner?

(gasps)

Han, yes.

Thank you for not making me
beg for my job back.

You would've begged?

Oh! Oh! Oh!

Oh!

Well, I should
walk off this boner.

Wait, I mean,
go get Earl out of here.

He's pitching his idea for

The Black Lincoln
to Scorsese,

and by Scorsese,
I mean a plant.

Yo, think about it, Marty.

Bobby, I felt bad
about not inviting Denise,

so I texted her
during the movie.

Hopefully,
she'll be smart enough

to change out
of her diner uniform,

and there she is,
and, no, she wasn't.

It's not usually this red.

I burned it on the grill.

So the worst part
of the night's not over.

Oh, my God.

It's retro, it's now,

it's a little tomato-saucy,
but it works.

I spilled spaghetti
and meatballs on myself.

You have a girlfriend?

No.

Don't worry,
we can find a third.

(phone chimes)

It's from Max.
It says,

"Meet me at the dessert bar.
It's an emergency."

She never says
something's an emergency.

She came to work
with a knife in her head.

*

Max, where did you go?

You missed everything.
And as hard as I tried,

they wouldn't give me
a second swag bag.

And I will not share
the Kate Hudson yoga pants.

You can have them,
'cause I have this!

CAROLINE: (gasps)

You stole an engagement ring?

Can I come out now?
It smells in there.

Oh, my God, Randy.

Are you upset
that Max is engaged?

Oh, wait!

(screaming)

Now I know why you wanted
to tell her without me.

-Back to the smelly room.
-No!

Aw.

Oh, my God!

This night that
was totally about me

is totally about you,
and I'm not even jealous!

Oh, my God.
Are you moving to L.A.?

Different kind of tears coming.

Nope, I'm moving here.

Should've done it
a long time ago.

I'm keeping my name,
by the way.

It'd be weird for people
to call me Randy.

(chuckles)

See?
How can I live without this?

See, Caroline?
You got your wish.

We're both with someone.

Looks like I got my wish.

-We're not gonna die together.
-(laughs)

You are more than welcome
to die with us.

So I hear you have
a boyfriend.

Yeah, he'll be right in.

He's getting Max's coleslaw
out of the limo.

The driver said
he didn't eat it,

but his face
is covered in mayonnaise.

Bobby, this is Randy...

-Max's fiancÃ©.
-What?

Um, I'll break up with him
if you don't talk American.

CAROLINE: (scoffs)

-You look familiar.
-So do you.

both: Aww.

You're that lawyer that

screwed my mother and sister
out of that reality show.

-Yeah, it was called...
 -Move Out, You're 40.

Yeah, we had to fire them
'cause they're insane.

I'm sorry, are you calling

my mother and sister insane?

Oh, not just me.
The state of New Jersey.

Oh, it's so cute.
They know each other.

(giggles)

Let's take this outside.
There's ladies here.

(scoffs)
Well, one.

That's a good idea.

First one you've ever had.

Okay, that's it.

His mother put a curse on me.

Yeah, and you haven't found

a good parking space since,
have you?

Bobby, don't ruin your suit.
We can't afford it.

Oh, my God, this is terrible.

-Can I see the ring again?
-(giggles)

Um, I licked it,
and it's not candy.

(chuckles)

(crashing, grunting, yelling)

(gasps)
Aww, they must've made up.

They're hugging.

(grunting, yelling)

This is not good.

And more not good,

we still have to work at
the diner to pay off my dress.

Did Bobby's mother
put a curse on us too?

(grunting, yelling)

Is it weird I think
that's a little hot?

Let me see the ring again.

(upbeat rock music)

*

(cash register dings)

Hi, it's been 20 minutes.
Have you decided?

Uh, we still need more time,
can you come back?

Sure. And I'm back.

Come on guys you're not buying a house.
Everything sucks.

Pick the thing that sucks the least,
and put it in you mouth.

Max, everyone keeps telling me
they can't decide,

it's like a support group
for bi-sexuals.

Something very magical
about to happen...

Please let it be
the rapture.

I need a day off.

In two minutes,
something very hip is happening.

If you have a camera,

make sure the flash
is on.

Why is he speaking
like that?

Wait a minute.

No one's ordering.

People keep checking the time
on their phones.

Everyone's wearing
matching new balance sneakers.

Flash mob!

♪ Party rockers
in the house tonight ♪

♪ whoo!
Everybody just... ♪

Oh, hell, no!

Caroline, Earl,
code red!

♪ Make you lose your mind ♪

♪ everybody just
have a good time ♪

♪ let's go ♪

♪ party rockers in the... ♪

I couldn't stop disco,
but I'll be damned

if any more of that crap
gets by me.

Why is flash mob over?

Flash mobs were over
a year ago.

Nobody told Han!

I want so bad to be hip.

Start by
never saying that again.

Hello?

Max, phone!

No!

What are you doing?

Only two people
call the wall...

collection agencies

and the landlord, looking
for the original tenant

whose name is on the lease!

- Hang up. Quick!
- Too late.

I've got to man up
and face it.

Hello?

This is what collection agency?

No, my granddaughter Max
is not here.

She died.

On her deathbed,
she said it was the stress

of being constantly harassed
by creditors.

That's juvenile.

Give me the phone.

Hi.
So sorry about that.

What's the issue exactly?

Well, I'm sure
she has every intention...

mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Oh.

Well, you're a doody head.

Never answer the wall.

But what are you
gonna do about it?

You can't just keep lying
to collection agencies.

You have to pay your bills.
I have a system.

I pay everyone
five dollars a week...

just enough to keep them
from freaking out.

It's the methadone-clinic
banking system.

That is a complete waste
of money.

Five dollars won't even cover
the interest you're accruing.

What's the interest rate
on your credit card?

Don't know,
but my interest rate

in the conversation is zero.

Max, how could you
not know that?

That's one of the first things

my father taught me
about finance.

Where...
at Embezzle U.?

Max, I interned
at Merrill Lynch.

Let me help you with this.
It's the least I can do.

I had nowhere to go.
You took me in.

Let me repay my debt to you
by helping with your debt

to everyone in the world,
apparently.

If you keep talking,

I'm going to
Merrill Lynch myself.

I'm one of those people

who gets off on untangling
big, complicated messes.

And since you won't let me
do your hair,

let me do your bills.

You want to do my bills?

Here's my portfolio.

And, uh, if you find
chocolate sprinkles in there,

they're not chocolate...

Or sprinkles.

Okay.

I've divided your bills
into three categories...

"impossible,"
"next to impossible,"

and "how the hell
did that happen?"

And I've divided my roommate
into three categories...

"annoying,"
"super annoying,"

and "how the hell
did that happen?"

I'm closing kitchen
in ten minutes.

I cannot stay later.

I have date with new woman
in my life.

She's very special to me.

I think she may be the one.

You are both welcome
to come watch us have sex.

Just putting it out there.

Just put it back in there.

I'm so excited, I don't even
know where to start.

Drumroll, please.

No?
Okay.

Oh, interesting.

Here we have a bill
from the pet castle,

yet you don't have a pet, and
you've never been to a castle...

Oh, except white castle.

You used a credit card
at white castle?

Yep.
That was good weed.

And the pet thing was
'cause I found a stray

and had to have her
cleaned up

before I could get anyone
to take her.

That would also explain
the charge for neutering.

Nah, actually,
that was for me.

Can't have any more
of these coming out.

Do you really think

it's fiscally smart
to be taking in strays?

Good point.
Move out tonight.

What is this...
a student loan?

Oh, my God.
Max, you went to college?

That wasn't a judgment.
It was just shocking...

kind of like seeing
a baby smoke on the Internet.

I love that kid.

Max, a student loan is
the worst bill you can ignore.

It can never be expunged.

We're breaking out "expunged"
on a weeknight?

You can't run away
from this bill.

I can run away
from anything.

I'm on my fifth identity.

It's just like that
but underwater!

Guys!

Sorry,
we're just closing, guys.

I'll take them, Max.
We need the...

uh, sit anywhere.

What was that roadrunner move
you just pulled?

There's still a smoke outline
of your body

Hanging in the air
out there.

Did Wile E. Coyote
just come in the diner?

- No, but my ex-boyfriend did.

Meep, meep.

Why is William
in Brooklyn?

Why is William
in this diner?

Why is every inbred rich guy
named William?

I don't want to see him.

Max, close the door.

I don't want him
to come in here.

Yeah, 'cause that happens
all the time.

Customers come
in the front door

and make a beeline
through the kitchen

to see if there's a waitress
hiding in the walk-in freezer.

Okay, what is the deal?

Tell me fast.

I'm nipping
like crazy in here.

Ooh, you're smuggling some
gumdrops there, too, ice queen.

His name is William Van Horn,
and he's...

I am leaving for sex.

Last chance for threesome,
foursome, possibly fivesome,

if her sister's train
gets in on time.

Oleg, please.

I don't have time
to be harassed right now.

Oh, okay.

I'll see you
and the gumdrops tomorrow.

Story. Go.

We met
at our parents' companies'

parent company picnic.

His family is
the Boston Van Horns...

story.
Stop.

Cut to the end.
Do we hate him?

He dumped me
when I lost all my money...

never called me,
not an email, nothing.

Oh, we hate him.

Wait. Which one's your ex...
the Asian one, the black one?

I'm kidding.
No, seriously.

The white one or the really,
really white one?

Really, really white.

Service, service, service,

service, service, serv...

you heard your bro.
Service him.

Oh, crushed!

Hey, you better be careful,

'cause I can give you a run
for your money.

I don't have any money.

Well, with a body like that,
you don't need any.

- Oh! Ba-bam!

Did you actually think
that was a good line,

or is that what you do

so the check gets paid
by Richie Rich?

Hold on.
Who said I was rich?

- Let me see your Hands.
- What...

looking to see if I have
poor-people calluses?

No, I wanted to see
how big your penis is.

With Hands that size,
you better be rich.

Oh! Shazam!

Not cool, bro.

- What's your name?
- Michelle Obama.

We're closed.

I'm William.
Give me your number.

Why? So you can put it
in your phone

and never call or text
or email?

Seriously.

You wouldn't know what to do
with a good girl if you had one.

But you're not a good girl.
That's why I want your number.

So how about it?

We're closed.

- Your sign says
"open till 2:00."

My, my.

How time does fly.

2:00, gentlemen...
nighty night.

What did I ever do to you?

You didn't mention me,
did you?

Ugh, no.
I just gave him...

just get to the end.
Do you hate him?

I hate him.

That was
the weirdest thing,

seeing him come in here.

No, the weirdest thing
is coming in here right now.

Why no?

Girl at urban outfitter said
it was hip.

You look like a lesbian

I made out with once
on a dare.

Han, you're adorable
exactly as you are.

Why are you trying
to be hip?

To meet girls.

Oh!

It's not that bad in here.

I thought my first trip
to a laundromat

would be
a lot more depressing.

Six years
we spent together,

and now he won't even look
at me.

Oh, not the bag.

I just looked at his bag...
now yours?

Max, it's driving me crazy.

What did you major in
in college?

I majored
in changing topics.

So what did you ever see
in your ex,

the lost Winklevoss twin?

We're not talking
about William.

We're talking
about your bills.

Well, I'm talking
about your Bill!

Oh, face!
Max...

We're trying to start
a cupcake business.

And I can't believe
I'm about to say this

but with my father's
financial baggage,

you're our best chance
for credit.

Listen, everybody's broke
in their 20s.

And everybody hides
from stuff.

You run into freezers.

I practice ignorance
and blackout drinking.

What's happening right now?

Hola, dudarinos.

The laundromat's
closing early.

We've rented it out
for our '80s pop-up disco party.

Bobby.

- Shouldn't it be called
an "'80s pop-up lame hipster

will do anything
to be ironic and lame" party?

"Lame"?

Don't think so.

What?

Vicki from small wonder
is coming?

Oh!

Embarrassed to be you
right now.

Unless you chicks have
75 disco-lovin' bucks,

be gone in ten minutes,

or my man here
will throw you out.

Don't let his tube top
fool you.

Bobby is mad wiry.

I'm wiry.

Small wonder?

Is that the show on TLC

about the little-people
magicians?

No.

It's an '80s sitcom
about this little girl robot

who lives
with a loving family.

A girl robot?

That's totally unbelievable.

No,
that's totally awesome!

The unbelievable part
is the loving family.

I love Vicki.

She had no
emotions and was empty inside.

My role model! We're staying.

$75?
To do what...

stand here
and dance next to...

Guy-girl and girl-guy
over there?

Come on, Chestnut,

go poo-poo
near the hipsters.

Hey, how cool would it be
if we could get

Chess to go poo
on a hipster?

How can
all of those people

have $75 just to dance
at a laundromat?

I've been doing my roots
with white-out.

Hipsters in Williamsburg
will pay for anything

if it makes them feel like
they're in on something new

no one else knows about.

All you need's a gimmick.

Dudes!

Can we ride your horse?

Sure.
100 bucks.

Okay.
I got to go to the ATM.

Wait. Stay right there.
We'll be right back.

Oh, my God.

Max, we are literally looking
our gift horse in the mouth.

We have something that's better
than an '80s disco party.

We have a horse.

If we throw
a big enough party,

charge hipsters
for horse rides,

we could pay off
your student loan!

You'd whore out Chestnut
like that?

Don't you have to get him
hooked on heroin first?

Max, I've got this.

I'm a brilliant event planner.

My sweet 16
was off the chain...

penthouse party,
pink and black theme.

Alanis Morissette sang songs
from jagged little pill.

On my 16th birthday,

my mom took too many
jagged little pills,

and I had to drive her
to the emergency room

to get her stomach pumped.

Was your childhood based
on the novel Push by Sapphire?

I wish!

The theme is
'90s horse party.

It's exactly the kind
of hip event

you're dying to be a part of.

It would happen
after closing,

so it won't affect business.

And all the horse rides
will take place out back.

So no damage will come
to the diner.

But why would I say yes
to giving up my diner

for no cash return?

You might get laid.

Great!

The '90s horse party
is happening on Thursday.

Fantastic.
Any other questions?

Yes.

What exactly is possibility

of percentage of me...

Getting laid?

All I can say is,

with the cute
'90s-themed-clothing incentive

and the trivia contest,

lots of cute hipster girls
will be here looking to...

Get laid!

I will go now
and start to research

American trivia facts
about the 1990s.

You realize we're gonna have
to give him something...

like flash a little boob,
something.

I feel like Han's
more of an ass man.

Good point... 'cause his head
is right there.

♪ Creep ♪

♪ oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I,
yeah ♪

♪ creep,
oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I ♪

Oleg, what's up?

Not enjoying
the '90s horse party?

I thought you said
"'90s whores party."

Now I'm wearing girdle
and deodorant for no reason.

Quite a turnout, Max.

Reminds me of the after-hours
clubs I used to go to,

you know, if all
the cool cats shooting dope

were replaced by sad,
white fools sipping light beer.

Look!

I did research and make myself
a 1990s trivia t-shirt.

"Talk to the Han."

Get it?

"Talk to the Han!"

That actually is cool.

I am hoping
it will help me...

Get laid?

Care to purchase
a tamagotchi

or a 90210-reo cupcake?

We came here wanting
to hate on you chicks hard.

But that horse you got
out back is mad cool.

You bested us,
party beast.

And to that,
I doff my cap.

- How much are the cupcakes?
- $10 each.

Ooh, I doff my cap again,
milady.

Max, look at all this.

We're a success!

I'll tell you
what's not a success...

the plan to get Han
some action.

Look at him over there.

- That's so sad.
- I know.

Go over there
and give him a "Han" job.

William!

Meep, meep.

You realize this is a freezer,
not a panic room, right?

Just go out there

and tear his smug, white ass
a new one.

I can't face him, Max.

Why? He's the one
who didn't call you.

I can't face him
because I'm a waitress.

Last time he saw me,

I was a billionaire
in a townhouse.

Now I'm a waitress
in a walk-in freezer.

So, when you were laying
around on your trust fund,

doing nothing every day,

having other people
scrub your toilet,

you could hold your head
up high?

But now
that you support yourself

by earning your own money,
that's somehow shameful?

Who cares what he thinks?

He is the guy who just paid $100
to party with a horse.

He's the loser, not you.

Really? 'Cause he's
out there having fun,

and I'm in here,

hugging a tub
of expired blue cheese.

Look...

You see that wad
of cash in your Hand?

You earned that.

Slap that wad in your palm
a few times!

Feel its power.

That's all you got?

Come on,
really squeeze that wad!

Feels good
in your Hands, right?

- Feels pretty good.
- Yeah.

Now slap it and say,
"this is my wad!"

This is my wad.

This is my wad!

This is my wad!

Go out there.

I'm going out there!

As soon as the ladies
calm down.

Are you kidding?

Show him what he's missing.
Let 'em pop, playa!

Where are you,
you rich poseur?

Oh! Uh...

Listen up!

That was meant exclusively
for one specific rich poseur.

All you other rich poseurs,

just continue
with the '90s!

Whoop, whoop!

Where is he?
Do you see him?

Uh, no.
He was right over there.

He's gone.

I don't get to shove this
in his face.

It would've been nice
to put my wad

in his face
for a change.

Oh, speaking of wads,
look over there.

Aw.

He's such a little pimp.

Are you okay?

Yeah.
Actually, I am.

I guess I didn't need
to go over there

and make some big,
dramatic speech,

telling him
that even though I'm a waitress,

I'm better than him.

I know that now.
Thank you.

And when I see him
one day in the future,

I'll be happy
to tell him that.

He just came
out of the men's room.

Let's get out of here!

What? I thought
you wanted to talk to him!

I said, "the future."
This is the '90s.

Let's get out of here.
Run!

Feels good running away
from your bill, huh?

So great.

See, that's what
I've been saying.

Well, at least
you don't have to run

from your student loan bill.

We can pay that off and still
have $50 for the cupcake fund.

I hate that college won.

Didn't you get anything
out of it?

You mean, besides mono
and an art teacher

whose idea
of finger-painting

was a little more "finger"
than "painting"?

Art teacher?

Max, was that your major... art?

Keep your eyes on the road.
You're driving.

I just thought
for, like, a second,

I could maybe illustrate
children's books.

Max, that's so sweet.

You're not like Vicki at all.

Max, look.
Han!

Aw, our little
somethin'-somethin'

got him a little
somethin'-somethin'!

I doff my cap, milady!

Last check, girl.

And my boyfriend Bobby
will be here soon.

He's sleeping over again.

My boyfriend, Bobby, I mean.

You know that cute guy
Bobby, my boyfriend?

Oh, I know your
boyfriend Bobby.

You name-drop him like you're
Gayle and he's Oprah.

Why don't you ever
stay at Bobby's?

His place can't be
worse than ours.

Unless he's what's
living in our wall.

No, that's definitely a woman
sobbing in there.

And I can't stay at Bobby's

'cause he lives at home
with his family.

I didn't know Bobby
lived at home.

(sighs) Wish I could
move back home.

They don't make
Pontiacs anymore.

The famous Bobby
lives at home?

Sounds like you landed
a real winner.

Actually, Han, Bobby
only moved back home

because his dad died last year.

H-E-double hockey sticks!

The one guy I take
a shot at, ever,

and he's the freakin'
Orphan Annie!

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Hey, I'm Bobby.

I'm looking for my
girlfriend Caroline.

You know that cute girl,
Caroline?

My girlfriend.

Bobby. Now, where have I
heard that name before?

Bobby, my boyfriend, stop.

Hey, before I forget.

My mom is throwing
a party tomorrow--

-Shhh!
-Are you crazy?

Bobby, never discuss
a party in the diner.

If the people we work with,

and I'm using "people" in
the loosest sense possible--

if they hear about a party,
they'll come to it!

We had to learn Navajo

just so we could talk
about our weekend plans

without them overhearing.

And then they learned Navajo.

Now it makes sense that Earl
asked me for wampum yesterday.

Okay, so my mom is throwing this
party at our house tomorrow.

You want to meet my family?

-(gasps)
-I'd love to meet them!

Especially your mom.

It goes without saying,
but she's gonna love me.

Why? Does she love people who
spit a little when they talk?

I don't spit when I talk.

Nope, I saw it that time.

But that's okay.

Moms love me almost as much

as truckers love Max.

You model for one mud flap,
you're made for life.

You're coming too,
right, Max?

My whole family's
gonna be there.

Caroline's whole family
should be there, too.

Aww, that's so sweet.

Sounds good.

What time should I bring
the sacrificial raccoon?

Oh, is it not a birthday?

You could hear from back there?

And through the wall
in my office.

Can't wait for the party.

Can I bring a Jell-O dessert?

I have a new Pikachu mold
I've been dying to try out.

Is it the same Pikachu mold
that you came out of?

Ah, so, about this party
we're all invited to,

is it open bar, or do we have to
go through the cabinets again?

So what kind of perfume
does your mom wear?

I need to know for
when I tell her

I've always loved it

and can't believe
she wears it too.

I don't know, but please
don't wear it

if you ever want to have
sex with me again.

(laughs)

Oh, uh, one more thing.

Don't tell her that I
spent the night here.

She thinks I stayed
at my friend Brian's.

She's kind of old-fashioned.

Can't be that old-fashioned.

She's cool with you sleeping
with your friend Brian.

All right, I'll see you later.

I got to go help my mom
set up for the party.

Uh, if I'm coming off
as too much of a bad boy,

I can tone it down.

(chuckles)

I'll be sure to do
cheek kisses at your house.

So!

Is there gonna be weed
at this party,

or can I make some
money selling?

Max, it is really
important to me

that Bobby's mom likes me,

which is why I hid your weed

and bought her
a lovely gift to bring.

In lieu of gifts, I always
just wear a low-cut shirt.

But I see why you had
to buy something.

Look.
(thick accent) Macaron.

(knocking at door)

Uh, you're maca-wrong,

'cause those are macaroons.

And I think I maca-ruined them

when I ate the filling
out of 'em.

Wait, you're going to Bobby's
mom's party dressed like that?

Are you aware your husband
is dressed for a canoe trip?

I Google Earth-ed the house.

There's a pool at
the house next door.

And a short fence.

Actually, the party
was canceled.

I'm so sorry.

You'll have to meet
Bobby's family

sometime never on.

Yep, party canceled.

There was a sinkhole.

Uh, still haven't
found the house.

Everyone's dead.

That's horrible.

I pre-paid a sitter.

Oh, I guess we'll just
hang out here then.

And since there's no pool--

Ahh! Okay!
Okay, fine!

The party's not canceled.
There's no sinkhole.

No one's dead.
Come at 4:00.

Just please don't embarrass me.

Uh, I think that was
directed at you, Max.

Awkward.

(upbeat music)

(doorbell rings)

-Hey.
-Hi.

We're here early,
'cause moms love promptness,

and our Uber driver was on
the front end of a police chase.

You're gonna nail it.
My mom's favorite show's "Cops."

Oh, I'm a series regular.

Oh, nice staircase.

You get along with the folks
that live up there?

Uh, sometimes.

Depends how my sisters
are feeling,

'cause that is still
part of the house.

(gasps)

Wow!

You didn't tell us you
lived in a castle.

(exclaims) Look at the TV
and chairs!

You guys must've
gotten this stuff

right after they laid it out
on the curb.

Bobby, I found the program
from your sixth grade play.

You were so good.

Like Leonardo DiCaprio.

Only not bloated.

[sighs]

Ma, I played a tree,
and I still got booed.

Sorry, she likes
to brag about me.

This is my mom.

Hi, Bobby's mom.
I'm Max.

May I say you have
a beautiful house?

And that's high praise,
'cause I've been in five.

And I'm Caroline.

Oh, that scent you're wearing

is my all-time favorite.

I sat on a deviled egg.

I hope you like macaron.

You don't think I
have enough food?

(chuckles)
I know this sounds insane,

but I don't know
if she love-love-loved me.

Don't worry--she takes
a little time to warm up,

but when she does,

you'll only notice
a little difference.

Uh, Bobby--question.

How did you get Queen Elizabeth
to sell you her throne?

Bobby, you only invited girls?

You knew I wanted
a sausage-fest.

I did bring macaron.

You must be Bobby's
sister, Denise.

I'm Caroline.

I'm Max, and I should have
worn a diaper here.

Seriously, Bobby, if you
never invite any guys over,

how am I gonna find one?

Ma cancelled my
Match.com account.

TERESA: I'm not paying
$9.99 a month

for you to be a slut!

Ma! Stay out of my business!

You treat me like
I'm still in my 30s!

Well, if there aren't
gonna be any guys here,

I'm gonna go smoke a J
and do my jigsaw.

Definitely popping by
Denise's room later.

Bobby, I can't explain it,

but somehow, when you stock
the Tab in the garage fridge,

it just tastes better.

Garage fridge?

How rich are you people?

You know who loved
an ice-cold Tab?

Jessica.

Ma! Really?

I specifically asked you
not to bring up Jessica.

Oops.

Who's Jessica?

She's my ex.

We stopped dating
over a year ago.

Dating?

You were engaged
to be engaged!

I'm sitting,
but I'm lying down.

She was the only girl
I ever thought

was good enough for my Bobby.

No offense, hon,
but look at her.

With that face, she could've
been a dental hygienist.

She's on your wall?

Only to cover a hole that
Denise punched in it...

when I broke up
with Jessica.

CHRISSY:
Did someone say Jessica?

Who is that?

And please don't say Jessica.

That--that's my other
sister, Chrissy.

She doesn't come out
of her room these days.

-She's still in mourning.
-Oh, over your dad?

Over Jessica.

She hasn't come out of her room
since they broke up.

And she was this close to
assistant manager at TCBY.

I'm over Jessica.
My family less so.

Oh, my God!

This chair has another chair
just for your feet!

Bobby, why didn't you
tell me about Jessica?

I told you about my father
being in prison.

No, you didn't.

My father's in prison.

Jessica's not important to me.

I think about her so little,
she might as well be AOL.

I'm on AOL.

Oh, my God, we know
nothing about each other.

Bobby, did you stock
the kitchen fridge, too?

'Cause I'm getting that
crisp, clean, bottle taste

from a can here.

I took my shoes off.
Hope that's okay.

Bobby, stop standing there
staring at Jessica.

Give someone else a turn.

I'm doing a load.

Go up to your room
and get your dirties.

I--I have to give 'em to her.

Otherwise she's gonna
go through my stuff,

and I have a check
from my grandpa

I don't want her to know about.

Chrissy!
I'm doing a wash!

CHRISSY: And fold everything
in threes this time, Ma!

The way Jessica used to!

I'll try, but I'm not perfect.

That was Jessica's thing.

CHRISSY: Got that right, Ma!

The woman was without flaws!

[grunts]

You might want
to wash that alone.

Believe it or not,
it's a white.

Max, what are you doing?

Relax, I have
the other one on.

No one's gonna get hurt.

I just need to stay calm

and figure out a way to win
Bobby's mother over.

I have to!
I have to!

You trying to get some
of that sweet, sweet

grandpa-check money?

(doorbell rings)

CHRISSY: Somebody get
the frickin' door!

Uh, I'll get the frickin' door.

No, no, no, no, no.

I have to win these people over.

I freaking got it, Chrissy.

Oh, great.
This should help.

(snoring)

Earl's got five more minutes
in that chair.

I'll bounce an old man.

Whose turn is it to see
if he's breathing?

-(snoring)
HAN: Oh, no, he's okay.

He's just having
a running dream.

You'll get that squirrel, buddy.

Well, clock's ticking.

Look, elephant in the room,

but I got to see what porno
looks like on that screen.

Oh, yeah, look.

I brought "Manchester
by the Double D's."

You see why we had
to learn Navajo?

It's all fine.
My mother loves having company.

Oh, not kidding; they're really
going to watch it

It doesn't fit.

Heh, if I had a nickel for
every time I've said that.

Yeah, he's got that right.

Bobby, I told you.

You can't leave
the front door open.

We live too close
to the YMCA.

No, Ma, these are
Caroline's friends.

They speak Navajo.

Okay, well, I hope
they like Italian,

'cause that's what I
spent all night making.

You know, I--
I think she's warming up.

You see I'm dealing with a
perfect ex-girlfriend situation.

I need you to be on my side.

Fine.

I don't think Jessica made
people take sides, just FYI.

Yeah, I think it's time for me

to switch my focus
from the mom to Denise.

I forgot, I'm actually
better with sisters.

I have to be!
I have to be!

Well, you better be.

'Cause I'm gonna tell you
the same thing

I told my old boyfriend,
Missionary Steve:

it's time to turn
this thing around.

Denise, there you are!

Oh, look at you.
I love a midday costume change.

And you said I couldn't wear
my eating robe to the party.

Well, since there aren't
gonna be any guys here,

I figured I'd just
get ready for bed.

Ooh, who's the hottie
over there?

The one running
in his sleep

or the one fanning his
underarms with a plate?

The muscular one.

Muscular?
You're gonna have to point.

Is there a different
"over there"?

Come on, guys,
in the dining room.

You have to taste
the sauce I made.

I used Jessica's recipe.

CHRISSY:
It's a frickin' delight!

Watch your mouth, young lady!

But she's right.

Hello.

(upbeat music)

*

Before we start eating,

Max, would you like
to say grace?

(mouth full)
Thanks, God?

I'll do it.

We thank God and his mother,

'cause we know his
mother does everything.

And he would never date a woman
without getting her approval.

Okay, Ma, I don't think Jesus
was a big dater.

He wasn't when I knew him.

(whispering) Han, I need you
to flirt with Denise.

-She likes you.
-I got that.

Her hand is on my knee.

Oop, not my knee anymore.

Excuse my reach.

You like them?
I got 'em for Christmas.

We all chipped in.

Jessica worked very
closely with the doctor

to design the shape texture
of the nipples.

I got her a calendar.

I don't know who Jessica is,

but I need the sauce recipe.

And my lovely wife and I

wouldn't mind seeing those
nipples at some point.

Well, there's no way they're
as good as this sauce.

Mmm, mm-mm.

Anyway, Caroline owns
a dessert bar.

What the hell is that?

Max, what do you think
of the sauce?

Max, you can be honest
if you don't love it.

What?
More.

-Mmm, mmm.
-Okay, we get it.

You like Jessica's sauce.

Mmm, you know, I'm so full,

but I can't stop.

You don't have to eat it.

Are you crazy?

This is a once in
a lifetime sauce.

I'm gonna push my Spanx
to the limit.

Could someone switch
seats with me?

What's going on
over there, Denise?

You keeping your
hands to yourself?

Uh, I'll sit next to her.

I'd like to move down and sit
next to Caroline.

Oh, so now you don't want
to sit next to your mother?

I'm not hungry anyway.

I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower.

(whispering) There's a big hole
in our shower curtain.

Thanks, but I use
a doctor-prescribed soap.

Thanks a lot, Han.

You couldn't just take a shower
with her for me?

CHRISSY: Ma!
Where's my plate?

Could somebody take a plate
up to Chrissy?

She's still too upset
to come out.

-You know, because of--
-We know, Ma.

I'll do it.

'Cause I--I don't even
like this sauce.

(all gasp)

No, I'll--I'll bring
Chrissy her plate.

(chuckles)

She's my last chance.

And save me some
of that sauce.

It's the best thing
I've ever had.

Don't worry, I filled
your purse with it.

CHRISSY: Does anyone work here?

Where's my food?

Well, well, well, Jessica.

You may make a great sauce,

but you can't stop me.

(shattering)

TERESA: What's going on
out there?

I heard a crash!

Uh, everything's fine!

A truck hit a kid outside.

Max, can you come here
for a second?

CHRISSY:
What's all the commotion?

I can't eat my frickin' feelings

if there's no food!

Was the kid on a bike?

(gasps) Oh, my God!
Look what you did to Jessica!

Why are you so jealous
of her, Caroline?

You'll never be Jessica, okay?
None of us will!

I didn't do it!

She just fell off the wall.

Max, she is trying
to destroy me.

CHRISSY:
Where's my food?

I'm starting to scratch
my arms again!

Okay, I'll fix the picture.

Give her my plate.

(whimpers) Hang on.

Let me just take
one more big bite.

Give me a little of that.

Oh, damn you, Jessica!

Max, how did you fix
Jessica's picture?

It looks perfect!

Wasn't easy.

I tried not to make
eye contact with her,

'cause I was starting
to get feelings.

Hey, there you are.

Are you okay? I know my
family can be a lot.

No, I'm having
a great time.

(gasps) You think
your mom needs help

putting out that macaron?

I noticed they're not out.

I also noticed one
in the birdcage.

You know what?

If you're not having
a good time, we can leave.

I'm a grown man.
She's not the boss of me.

TERESA: Bobby!
-Coming, Ma!

Caroline, relax.

Nobody likes you right away.

I just got there last year,

and there's still a lot
of red flags.

(upbeat music)

*

Thank you for letting me
borrow Denise's Snuggie.

I feel like I'm back
in the womb again.

But it doesn't reek
of cigarettes.

Wait.

I think it does.

I like it.

I'm gonna like it even more

when it's on the floor tonight.

Is that one still breathing?

(snoring)

All right, Ma,
I'm going to karate.

Karate?

Well, well, well.

Tae Kwon Hello.

I happen to be a yellow belt.

Oh, yeah?

(exhales sharply)

Oh, yeah.

I got five of the macaron
 back from the birdcage.

I'll get your Snuggie
back to you by tomorrow.

I'll give to Bobby in
the morning

when he leaves Caroline's.

You said you slept at Brian's.

You lying to me now?

Ma...

I was with Caroline last night.

But I didn't see him naked.

I did.
Our bathroom door doesn't lock.

I see why he's your
favorite, Mrs. F.

Uh, we're watching something.

Can you two talk somewhere else?

It's fine.
I'll turn it up.

Where--where's the remote?

Whoa, Ma, I--I only got
engaged to be engaged

'cause Dad was sick, and I
wanted you to be happy.

But now I'm with
Caroline, and...

Caroline makes me happy.

-I do?
-She does?

You do.

She does.

(glass shattering)
MAX: (gasps)

-Okay, it was--
-Uh, it was a sign...

that Jessica didn't
belong there anymore.

You know what?

You make my Bobby smile.

And he's even more handsome
when he smiles.

Chrissy, come down
and meet Caroline!

CHRISSY: She hot?
Cause I don't like uggos, Ma.

She's gorgeous.

TERESA: She looks like me.

Just with a little
more mustache.

Welcome to our home, girls.

BOTH: Oh, thank you!

BOTH: You have no idea how much
this means to me!

Try and get out of this hold.

Who says I want to?

So same time next Sunday?

*

(cash register dings)

All right, I closed out
the cupcake register.

Here is our rent money.

Give me back the envelope, though,
'cause it's also my jewelry box.

No, I closed out the register.
I have our rent money.

Max, do you know
what this means?

Unless I was hit in the head
by a piece of farm equipment,

it means we have extra money.

I wanna do
the extra money dance,

but we don't have one because
we've never had extra money!

The only extra money dance
I know involves ping-pong balls

and I'm really
out of practice.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[cash register bell dings]

♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ♪


Earl, I brought you
your favorite.

A half-black, half-Chinese
belly dancer?

A coconut cupcake.

Look at Caroline
over there.

She's flirting harder
with him

than I flirt
with heart disease.

Stop, stop! I'm only
on episode two of season one.

I will kill you!

Then...
To be continued.

Oh! It's gonna be continued...

Well, then,
we will continue this...

When we continue this.

If that's your game, you're gonna
be living with me forever, Fran.

He's been in my section three nights
in a row for the Turkey Club.

I'm calling him
"the Turkey Club cutie".

I'm calling
poison control.

I think he's getting ready
to ask me out.

He wanted to know if I live around
here and what time I get off.

If a man's gonna wait
for you to get off,

he's a keeper.

So...

See you next time.

I will see you next time
as well.

Bye.

- What's that?
- I don't know. How would I know?

Because it came out
of your head...?

I don't have
hair extensions, Max.

- [Laughs] Okay, I'll throw it out.
- No! I'll keep it for this story!

What story?

The story about how we found

a blonde hair extension
out of nowhere that night.

It's hilarious!

Well, it's already funnier
than most of your stories.

Oh, look, there's another
hilarious story!

Okay, Max, I have
a confession to make.

I have hair extensions.

I also have a confession
to make.

I murdered a man
in Rhode Island.

I just have a few.
It gives me volume.

Too bad it doesn't
give you depth.

Now I have to go and try
and reattach these.

These weaves
are supposed to last.

This is unbe-weave-able!

I found this
in the lettuce.

Any sign of a NuvaRing in there?
'Cause I can't find mine.

Caroline's losing her hair,
isn't she?

Is she sick?
Does she have cancer, The Big "C"?

No, Little You.

She doesn't have The Big "C".
She barely has the double "A's".

- Han found more of your hair.
- He knows about the extensions?

No, he thinks you have cancer.

Oh, good!
So no one knows.

Hola, ladies!
Your night just got sexier.

Luis, you punched out hours ago.
What are you doing here so late?

On your way homo?

[Laughing]
Good one, hooker!

No, I'm between clubs.
Circus just became a straight club,

and Satellite doesn't become
a gay club for a half hour.

So... I'm here to have a cocktail
with my bro Oleg.

Luis, we told you.
Oleg is straight.

Oh, please!
So am I in Alabama.

Well, he left already.

But I told him I was gonna stop by.
Typical man. Fear of intimacy.

Oh, Carolina,
while I'm here...

This is yours.
I found it during my shift.

- Ooh, tips from my tables?
- More like hair from your head.

I knew this was all too good to be true.
You have extensions.

No, I have cancer.

No, you have extensions.
Good try. Later!

Hey.
Notice anything different?

I took some of the extra money
and got new hair extensions.

And I also got you a surprise.
I put it in your room. Go look!

I'm not interested
unless it's a potbelly pig

or a potbelly pig
in a pilgrim costume,

or a pilgrim in a potbelly
pig costume, or just pot.

Hint, hint. I put it on your bed.
What do you think? Do you love?

Okay...
Why is all this crap on my bed?

- And what the hell is it?
- That's a bed skirt.

My bed doesn't wear skirts.
It's a dude!

I know, because it pokes me
in the back while I'm asleep.

I got you new bedding, and me
some cute new flannel jammies.

They have Eiffel Towers
on them.

They were marked down because
everybody hates French people.

These don't even have stains!

How am I gonna know
which is the top now?

Max, what's the problem?
You've had those old sheets forever.

- You don't even have a spare set.
- A spare set of sheets?

Who am I,
the Queen of England?

You're so frustrating,
I'd pull my hair out...

But I'm not sure
which of it is mine.

Look! Look!
Are you happy?

Chestnut's upset.
He knows we're fighting.

Good! He should know that if
he goes out for a bag of chips,

he could come home to find
you replaced his saddle with a thong.

I got you a present.
Would you be this angry at Santa Claus?

Who's that?

Max, please. Just for a change,
try sleeping on something nice.

[Scoffs] Fine!

But if I wanted to sleep
on something nice,

I would have hooked up
with that guy who moved home

to take care
of his sick mother.

Watch your back, Chestnut.

Watch your back.

Where are my old sheets,
bitch?

Why?

Why are you calling me a "bitch"
at night?

I was sleeping
in my new jammies.

Well, I can't sleep
without those sheets.

So where are they?
I checked all your drawers.

And by the way, who hides
their vibrator in a Starbucks cup?

You already know the answer,
so I'm going back to sleep.

Whoa, whoa!

Why!

Why am I on the floor
in my new jammies?

Where are they?

I don't have them.
I gave them to the poor.

You took them
from the poor!

And the poor
wants them back.

Well, it's too late. I put them
in the Salvation Army donation bin.

Well, get up.
You're going to the army, bitch.

[Distant sirens]

Whyyyy?

Why are we here
in the middle of the night?

What are we doing?

Here it is.
Come on, follow me.

Max, is this
where you kill me?

'Cause I always knew it was gonna
happen, I just didn't know when.

This feels right though.

I should kill you.

Those sheets were
really special to me, okay?

Oh, did you lose
your virginities on them?

I don't have sex in beds.
That's where I eat.

Caroline,
I have a confession.

- What is it?
- You have hair extensions.

Okay, I'll tell you,
but look away.

It's the pillowcase.
I've had it since I was a kid.

It's like soft and nubby and it had
this edge that I'd like... rub,

and it relaxed me when things
were crappy, which was all the time.

I guess I still need that pillowcase
to sleep, or whatever.

- Max, that's so sad.
- Of course it's sad!

When has it ever been
a happy tale?

All right,
I need to crawl in here.

Max, y'reouust gonna crawl
into that dirty box?

We don't know where
that bin's been.

By the way, "dirty box" was my
nickname in continuation school.

I need help. Would you rather
I step on your back or your head?

My head? Hardly.
Not at these prices.

- Come on, gimme ten fingers.
- I already did.

Behind your back
while we were walking here.

No, like this,
so I can step into it.

- You know, like a finger basket.
- Finger basket...?

Is that another nickname
of yours?

No, but for one summer,
it could've been.

Forget this, just let me
pull this stuff over.

(Both)
Eww, eww, eww, eww, eww.

Max, I feel like we're not even
acknowledging our low points anymore.

Okay, Max,
now be very careful.

And on the count of...

Wow! You could've been
a great gymnast,

if you'd had money, coaches,
and a breast reduction.

Are you okay?

Max?

Gonna need
some voice contact.

(Max)
I'm not in here alone.

What do you mean
you're not alone?

(Max)
I'm not in here alone.

Stay calm!
I will get you out of there.

No, I won't.

(Max) I'm looking
for a lever on the inside.

Get outta my house!

OK, I just wanna check and see
if you're on my pillowcase.

Max, no!
I need my sweet sheets!

Let it go. If your sheets are under
there, they're no long sweet.

Get outta my house!
And close the door!

Okay! Okay!

God, Sheez.
You'd think we'd slept together.

What am I gonna do?
I can't sleep without those sheets!

I'm so angry at you!

I'd be even angrier if I hadn't
found this great bra.

Why are you going to Sophie's
if you're trying to sleep?

She's the loudest person
we know.

Even black people at the movies
tell Sophie to be quiet.

I am going to Sophie's
to get a sleeping pill.

Or as she likes to call them,
"night candy".

You don't need a pill.

Listen, I have a great sleep technique
that my sleep coach taught me.

I have slept with
my fair share of coaches,

and if anything,
they kept me awake.

Max, it's 3:00 A.M.

Any normal person
is sleeping right now.

Hi, girls.

Just doing a puzzle
and listening to Elvis.

You two want a Mai Tai
before you get too Ty-Ty?

No, thanks,
but speaking of Ty-Ty,

I was hoping I could snag
one of your sleeping pills.

Oh, sure, I can hook you up.
I never use them.

I only need three hours
of sleep at night

and six during the day.
Come on.

Sophie...

Notice anything new?

Oh! Yeah!

You planted more hair
on your head.

I heard.

Max! You told her?

No, it was on CNN.

They led with Syria, and then
did a solid five on your hair.

Here we go...
Pills and spices!

You have a spice rack
full of pills?

You gotta cook me dinner
sometime.

Let's see.

Fish oil, penicillin,
amoxicillin...

Skittles.

Oh, and this is
my German pill

in case they release the bombs
or I'm ever abandoned in space.

Here you go, Max.
Nighty-night.

Oh, you know what?

What the hell!
I'm gonna have one two.

It's a slumber party!

Uh-oh.

Oh, now you got another
rack full of pills.

Oh, you know what?

Don't wait for me, Max.
This might be a while.

Max, do you really need
to take that?

People do weird things
on sleeping pills.

My friend Candice Travelstead
buttered a wallet and tried to eat it.

Don't worry,
I don't have a wallet.

Wait a minute!
Wait a minute.

Is that the sleeping pill,

or is that my emergency
space pill that kills you?

Either way,
I'll get some shut-eye.

Max, no! You are not gonna die
and leave me here alone.

I still don't know how to go East
on the "L" train without a chaperone.

Max, it's 3:30 A.M.,

and sleep coach Caroline here
will have you asleep by 3:45 the latest.

You're supposed to be taking
a hot bath.

I was, but when I put the stopper in,
something pushed it back out again.

Where's that pill?

I've got it on my person,

and if this doesn't work
I'll give it to you.

Oh, I'll go elbow-deep for that pill.
And don't think I won't.

Max, meet your new sheets.

New sheets, meet...

Don't make me meet the sheets.
I'm not a mental patient.

If I was, I'd be living
in a much nicer place.

And all my pillowcases
would have edges.

Wow, even your pillowcase
had an edge.

What was it like anyway?

It was kinda like
the end of your new PJ's,

but not the queerest thing
I've ever seen.

A candle?
What are we, witches?

Now, imagine yourself
in a relaxed, beautiful place.

Breathe in and out.

In and out.

Look, if there's one thing
old finger basket know how to do

it's in and out.

- Gimme the pill.
- I'm not finished yet.

But just so you know,

that pill has changed colors
three times in the last hour.

So it's either deadly,
or an everlasting gobstopper.

I am so mad at you.
You took my one thing.

That pillowcase was
my one special thing.

In my whole life of people
taking things away from me,

that was the one thing
no one took,

and now I'm never
gonna sleep again.

And I love sleeping.

Dreaming is the closest thing
I have to cable TV.

Enough, Max!

I've been very patient with
this weird attachment you have

to this little piece of sheet.

You're a piece of sheet.

Listen, if I learned anything
when I lost everything,

it's that, "A,"
there's no wiggle room

when it comes to cottage cheese
expiration dates,

and "B," you can't get
attached to material things.

Oh! Okay, Extensions.

What does that mean?

It means that your material things
are literally attached to your head.

Not the same thing at all.

Your dependency on that pillowcase
is all in your head, you don't need it.

Oh. You don't need this.

You owe me $14. Ah!

Run a tab.

I'm not about to sit here
and take this abuse

because you have an unhealthy
attachment to a pillowcase.

Good night, Malibu Barbie.

I hope you're not trying to insult me,
because she's gorgeous!

And for the record, I do not have
an unhealthy attachment to my hair.

Oh, really...?

[Caroline gasps]

You're a monster!

[Door slams]

[Sighs]
I'm sorry, I can't sleep.

- I'll be fine. Just give me the pill.
- (Caroline) No! It's all in your head!

Go to sleep!

I tied the doorknob to my bed with a rope
and locked all the bedroom windows.

Are you trying to hurt me
or turn me on?

Brace yourself, Earl.

When Max gets here, she will
not be in a good mood.

Caroline, if I wanted to work around people
in a good mood, I'd go work at Google.

She hasn't slept
since yesterday

and is furious because I won't
give her a sleeping pill.

Smart move. Sleeping pills mess you up.

I took one once,

woke up a day later on the roller
coaster ride in Coney Island.

I love roller coasters.

Me too,
when I'm in a seat.

Oh, hello!
How are you two tonight?

Oh, no. She's nice.
She must've gotten a pill somewhere.

No. No pills.
Just had some clarity.

Follow me, please.

Oh, okay. Did you smoke
or snort this clarity?

Now, since you were nice enough
to get me new sheets,

I got you something in return.
Here.

Oh, is this like an apology,
thank you kind of thing?

Now watch. This is how
one graciously accepts a gift.

What the hell is this?

A wig?

Either that or you scalped
a lesbian from the '80s.

Yep, I grabbed her bolo tie and
climbed up on her shoulder pads.

You took away
my security thing...

The pillowcase...

So now I'm taking away your
security thing... your hair.

You can wear that
on your head tonight

and then tell me again
how this is all in my head.

Did you have to get
the ugliest one they had?

What do you want
for 37 cents?

Fine! I'll put this roadkill
on my head

just to prove to you that I am
so much more than my hair.

I am my attitude, my spirit,
my brain, my bravery.

- Put it on.
- Max, I'm scared.

Go.
The bangs go in the back.

That's my kinda woman.

Cobb salad, pick-up!
[Bell dings]

Uh... hey, Sophie.

Are you here
for the mafia widow discount?

Earl, I'm incognito.

I'm making a drug drop
for Max.

Hey, Max!
I got your drugs!

Thanks.

And I love that you have an outfit
for everything I ask you to do.

Where's the blonde narc,
Max?

[Laughing]

Oh, my God!

Did Caroline join
a bowling team?

Max! No!

Aw, crap! Rod Stewart
just busted us.

Let her have some fun.
What's the big deal, square?

The big deal is that Max
thinks she needs these pills

because I threw away
her blankie.

It was a pillowcase,
and I need it to sleep.

She has to rub it.

In Poland, I had this little
thing that I liked to tickle

before I went to sleep.

But my aunt threw it away.

What was it?

My cousin Nora.

Give me the pills.

Nope. And, Max, you were wrong.
See? I'm not attached to my hair.

In fact,
I am loving my new look.

Am I a single mom
trying to keep it simple?

Am I an assistant D.A.
in over my head?

Or am I Charlize Theron
in The Jon Bon Jovi Story?

Maybe, and I'm fine with it.
'Cause I am not my hair.

Oh, my God, Turkey Club cutie!
Hide me!

On your knees in a bad wig.

Listen, girl,
I've been there.

No, I just don't
wanna be seen.

Caroline, Caroline, I love you,
but I can't hear anymore.

That hair was hard enough
to look at in the '70s.

Fine! You were right,
I was wrong.

Now help me get this off.
He can't see me like this.

That's right,
gimme the pills.

Max, no. You don't need them.
We don't know where they've been.

[Sighs] Fine!

I'm going home
to try to sleep.

Since this is all your fault,
you can finish my shift.

You're on your own, lady who lived
across the street from Al Bundy.

I gotta say, I'm pretty
impressed I can do this.

It's not so hard. I don't know what
Chanice is always bitching about.

I guess that's who she is.

I can't believe
I still haven't slept.

I'm gonna be awake forever.

It's gonna be like that movie
Awakenings, but not at all.

Max, you can rub me.

Wow, that wig changed you.

No, here.

Rub the edge on the bottom of my
jammie top like it's your pillowcase.

No. If I rub the bottom of your
jammies, that would be my bottom.

Turkey Club cutie
didn't ask me out,

probably because my hair
was so messed up from the wig.

Don't be so hard on yourself.
It could've been your personality too.

You really think he only
liked you for your hair?

I only like me for my hair.

- Told you. You're attached to it.
- So attached to it!

Twirling it, tossing it,
flipping it.

Feeling it on my neck,
on my shoulders, on my back.

Caroline Channing without the option of
a sleek updo is not Caroline Channing.

And I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I judged you for having
an attachment to something

when I'm no better.

And I'm sorry I got rid
of your sweet sheets.

Max.

Max...?

Night, Max.

Whyyyy?

Why can't I ever
have anything nice?


So it's a tequila shot on
top of Devil's food cake.

We can call it Satan's nipple.

Okay, but I think the menu's
already a little nipple heavy.

As am I.

Girls, two questions--

-No.
-And no.

I was coming to see how baby
Barbara's baptism was coming.

Also, what drink goes best
with a heavy muscle relaxer?

I'd try the nipple-tini
or the piÃ±a co-nipple.

Oleg, are you okay?

I haven't seen you this
wound up since California

passed that law to make
porn actors wear condoms.

It ruins the visuals.

You're the godparents,
and my mama is coming

all the way from
the Ukraine for this baptism,

so it's got to be
balls to the walls perfect.

Not that balls on walls
isn't a fun theme,

but I'm thinking of going
another way

with the baptism party,

what with there being
a child involved.

Now, if you don't mind,
we're not supposed to be

at the diner for 10 minutes,
so we'll see you there

in like an hour.

What's this?
Eh, doesn't matter.

(coughs)

Whatever it is,
put that on the menu.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Caroline, did you get
my RSVP to the baptism?

Sure did, two seconds
after I sent the evite.

Sorry about the lag time.

I thought I was
being punked again.

But, I'm happy to help
on an official level.

I've been involved in many
baptisms at my church.

The Church of
Latter Day Smurfs?

For your information,
I've achieved a position

of some stature.

Papa Smurf?

It's not a Smurf church!

I want to be the altar boy.

Okay, but no Communion wine
for you.

You get slutty
when you drink.

Oh, look, Oleg's mom's here.

More clean-shaven
than I expected.

Really, girls?
Mom jokes?

Oleg.

Mama!

My gorgeous, beautiful,
sexy baby boy.

He didn't tell us
she was blind.

-Mmm.
-Mmm.

Should we stop this before Oleg
becomes his own step-father?

To think I made this.

You win some,
you lose some.

I look fantastic, eh?

I've been doing
Pilatskis.

Like Pilates, only
instead of rubber bands

you do it with
big airplane tires.

Oh, mama, you're back to
your shot-putting weight.

Ahh.

Feel my thigh, eh?
Squeeze it.

Harder.

Harder!

All right,
now punch it.

Like mother/son
fight club.

Hi, I'm Caroline Channing.

They're making a movie about me,

but I'm just a regular person.

That they're making
a movie about.

I'm Max Black-- I'm sure you've
heard about me from Oleg

or Channel 7 Scam Busters.

Oh, and this is Earl.
He runs the register,

and he's the reason we know
our defibrillator works.

Yeah, thanks for bringing me
back from heaven, girls.

If you need a place to crash,
my roommate is out of town

for the weekend.

Mm, well,
I do like Black Russians,

so we're halfway there.

Sorry, Earl, she's spoken for.
She's dating my Uncle Oleg.

Well, if you two ever
decide to tie the knot,

I am a Universal Life Minister.

Did I mention my roommate's out

of town for the weekend?

I'm only asking
'cause I forgot.

Mrs. Golishevsky, Han Lee,
your son's boss.

He's a great--

A good--

We haven't had to--
Welcome!

Max and I are the godparents,
Mrs. Golishevsky.

I know what you're thinking:

I look too young
to have a godbaby.

Don't tell me
what I'm thinking.

Two godmommies?
Really?

All right, no, I get it.
I'm very hip.

Who among us has
not kissed a woman?

Han.

It was a pleasure to--

You seem--

I'm so happy we--

Catch you later.

Hey, everybody.

I would've gotten here sooner,
but Teresa Giudice

was on Hoda & Kathie Lee,
and Barbara wanted to watch.

It's okay--
she's strapped in.

This is my beautiful wife and my
beautiful baby mama, mama.

It's a pleasure,
I know.

How can you listen to
that accent all day long?

Yikes.

Yikes?

It means...she yikes it.

Oh, there she is.

Little baby Bair-bra.

You know, I would have
named her Bohuslava.

Isn't that
a prettier name, Oleg?

(spits)

No, we like Barbara,
don't we, Oleg?

Anybody gonna put in
an order around here?

Wow, haven't been
to a church in, uh...

Have I ever
been to a church?

If I burst into flames,
you can have all my possessions.

Great, I'm really looking
forward to owning

two bongs and
a treasure map.

Oh, that's just a place mat
from Bubba Gump's.

Learned that
the hard way.

Hi, Mrs. Golishevsky.

You look so nice.

I don't look nice.
I look fantastic.

This is Father Kozac.

He will be performing
the baptism.

Yes, and I also perform
in an R&B group.

You may have heard of us:
Altar Boys to Men?

You two have to wear
this on your heads,

to show respect for God.

And also because most
Ukrainian women are bald.

Hands up!
Give me the baby!

All rightsky,
should we get started?

Em, here you go, Max.

Oh, hmm.

What, like a hot-potato
situation?

Before the baptism, the father
will question you about

guiding the spiritual life
of the child.

You know, taking her to church,

making sure she only wears pants

to drive the tractor.

Yeah, then I will say a prayer,

you hand me the baby...

(thud)

And I will baptize her like so.

Eh?

So basically we're just
waterboarding a baby.

Excuse me, do you know
what a baptism is?

No, she knows,
she's just shy.

So, Max, do you pray?

Oh, she prays all
the time, right, Max?

I'm always hearing her
in her bedroom say,

"Oh God, oh God, oh God!"

One of those times was
because an owl got in there.

So do you have a good
relationship with the Father?

Uh, well, he took off
before I was born, so,

all I know about him is he
makes really great decisions.

No, no, now, that is
not the father I mean.

I mean that one.

Oh, Santa Claus?

I want to, but every house
in one night?

Come on.

She got hit in the head
with a softball recently.

No, not Santa Claus!

What do you think,
this is some kind of joke?

You are not fit to be my
granddaughter's godmommies,

I don't care how much
I hate her name.

Kaputzki.

God, oh God, oh God.

What?
Did an owl get in here?

I can't believe we
got fired as godmothers.

I've never been
fired before.

And don't bring up that
Habitat for Humanity thing.

We mutually parted ways.

Yeah, and then you guys
never finished my house.

(knocking)

Hey, girls.

Hey, look at this new machine.

It's like a radio
that monitors the baby.

Live from upstairs,
it's W-B-A-B-Y!

It's a great thing
if you're not home,

or you just don't
trust your baby.

I'm assuming you haven't
talked to Mrs. Golishevsky

since you're not
scream-crying at us.

I am now!

What happened
at the rehearsal?

Um, everything's fine,
but Mrs. Golishevsky

fired us as godparents.

She really did
not like Caroline.

I am not the one she put
a thousand year curse on.

I got it down to 500.

Oh, she can't just come up here

and fire my godparents
and drink my beer

and talk over
 American Ninja Warrior.

Sophie, she's only here
for another week, and then

everything will go
back to normal.

We'll have the bed
to ourselves again.

Oleg, if she thinks she
can fire my godparents

and use my kettle bells, then
I'm calling off the baptism.

We need to go upstairs and
set your mother straight.

And if you think that
you are gonna have sex

in the next three hours,
oh, well,

you've got another
thing coming!

Three hours?
What about hand stuff?

Oh, we'll see.

I didn't want to bring this up
when she was upset,

but those are my kettle bells.

(knocking)

I'm upset too.

That was the only party I was
invited to this year.

Girls, I wanted to show you
the two robes I'm considering

for the baptism.

And, FYI, your doorbell is
electrocuting people.

Definitely the white.
The baptism's off.

Bye.

Max, Han just made me
realize something,

and not just that
he would look

really cute in a dress.

Between him, the baby,

and Earl being a minister,
we have almost everything

we need for a baptism.

We did do that exorcism here,
which clearly didn't work

because that 1800s lady
was watching me sleep

again last night.

Anyway, where is it written that
a baptism has to be in a church,

other than the Bible?

I mean, all we need
is holy water.

Ask the 1800s lady.
She's always carrying a bucket.

*

Why not steal holy water
from a church?

God's already mad at me.

I woke up with a zit
behind my ear.

Wow, that's all
I can look at now.

Leave it!
That's my Saturday night.

Okay, I'm more nimble,
so you distract Father Kozac

while I grab the holy water.

Nice jug.

Max, I've been waiting six
years for you to say that.

Now go tell Father Kozac
you need to confess.

(groans)
Okay, but then I'll get

kicked out
of the crypts.

Max and Caroline, Sophie said
the baptism's canceled,

as is Altar Boys
to Men's next gig.

It's been a tough day.

Actually, Max is
here to confess.

I'm traditionally
more of a victim.

All right, let's do this.

Where's your little
shame box thing?

Our confessional is under
construction,

although it's taking Sergei
forever.

We can do it right here.

Oh.
(laughs)

Oh, hmm, suddenly I can't
think of much to confess.

Pretty sure someone
 Men in Black'd me in 2008.

A-ha, well,
start by kneeling.

Okay.

Oh, some stuff's starting
to come back to me.

Just to summarize, uh,
fires, fires, knife fights,

robberies, robberies,
knife robberies,

but third grade is where
the real sinning began.

Oh, just give me a second.
I'm on a real roll here.

* Ahh

For an illegitimate,
blasphemous, back-alley baptism,

I think it looks pretty.

Hey, when are we gonna get
started, girls?

I'm performing a conscious
uncoupling at 2:00.

Ooh, this is cute.

Much nicer than
the church/slaughterhouse

I was baptized in.

Sophie, you look beautiful.

Oleg, I'm glad you didn't
wear your vagina tie.

It's dirty.

Hey, thanks for stealing
the holy water and going to

hell for baby Barbara, girls.

I'm just glad
I look good in red.

Max, you're gonna have
so many friends there,

and I'm not gonna
know anyone.

Let's get ready
to baptize.

I sent my mother to Curves.

It's a bi's and tri's day
for her.

Speaking of bi's
who try.

I told you, I thought Grindr
was a kitchenware app.

Found out the hard way that
"melon baller" has two meanings.

Hey, before we start, can I get
a hit off of this thing?

It's an incense boat,
Earl, not wacky-tobacky.

We ain't picky.

Puff, puff, pass,
sister act.

I'd be insulted if that wasn't
my third favorite movie.

Sophie, oh, Barbara's dress
is beautiful.

Hi.
Oh, I love her makeup.

Who did the smokey eye?

All right,
let's huddle up.

Ugh, this reminds me
of my time singing doo-wop

over a trash fire.

Okay, let's begin.

Ashes to ashes, dust to--

oops, wrong page.

Max and Caroline, yeah,
as Barbara's godparents,

do you agree to look out
for her welfare and to be

honest if she puts on
a few pounds?

I mean, you know, not now,
but in a couple of months?

Hey, I like baby who
can fill out a diaper.

I think she just
filled one out.

Hi, Barbara.

It's my fault you're having

your baptism in a bar
instead of a church,

but that's just how we roll.

You're family now,
and I promise,

no matter what happens,
we will always have your back.

Yeah, you can talk to me
about boys, or girls,

or whatever they have
by the time you're a teenager.

You can call me Uncle Han,
the Han-ster.

You know what?
Han's fine.

In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost,

I baptize this child
Barbara Kuchenski Golishevsky.

Yay!

We did it, Sophie.

We baptized little
Bohus--Barbara.

Aww, she's smiling.

Hey, oh, yeah, you know what?

She can tell that she avoided
an eternal hell fire.

What is going on here?

Mama, you're back so soon.

Damn you, Curves.

I forgot it's an hour workout

packed into 30 minutes.

The gym is garbage.

They don't even have nunchucks.

What, you're not having this
baptism without me, are you?

Go ahead, Oleg.

Tell her the truth,

or you're sleeping
in the middle tonight.

Mama, here's the truth,

whether you like it or not:

My friends and I like to dress
up and put on pretend baptisms.

Come on, I know
you have balls.

They were hanging out of
my nightgown this morning.

Mama, we just baptized
Barbara without you.

Sophie wants Max
and Caroline as

the godparents,
and so do I.

So you're siding with
these people against your mama?

Yes, mama.

Oh, there's those big,
beautiful balls.

Are they out?

I don't know, but I
can't see them again today.

Oleg, you sound just like
your sister, Oleg.

Are you gonna spank me in here,
or can we go in another room?

Because I don't love, love, love
the underwear I'm wearing.

To stand up to me,

you must really love
these people.

No, Oleg, I am not
going to spank you.

That is your wife's job now.

I will send you my paddle.

Aw, yeah, that would be great,
Mrs. Golishevsky,

'cause I shattered the last one.

Call me mama.

Aww, okay, mama.

No, that doesn't work.

So I'm just gonna put
the holy water back

where I got it, and it'll be
like I never stole it at all.

I can't risk
the wrath of God.

Or have I already
suffered it?

It's so hard to tell.

Would you stop overreacting?
Our walls bled once.

Here comes the priest.

Max, did you come back
to finish confession?

I want to hear what happened
when you were living

with Jack Nicholson.

Did I get all the way
up to fifth grade?

So you're just here to bring
back the holy water?

You knew about that?

God sees everything.

Really?

Yes, but so do
our security cameras.

And I thought you weren't
really a believer.

Uh, I don't know, I mean,
I never met my dad,

but sometimes I think
maybe he's out there

hoping I'm gonna be okay.

Plus, if there's no God,
how do you explain

America's Funniest Home Videos?

Right?
Why would you have a pie

cooling next to a trampoline?
(laughs)

Hi, father.

We were just in the neighborhood

doing good deeds for old people.

He knows.

What do the kids say?

Busted?

So lying to a priest?

What's that gonna get me,

five more years
in our apartment?

Come on, it's not that bad.

You, me, and the wet 1800s lady
make a great team.

She said it herself through
the hole in her throat.

Weird, 'cause she told me that
your snoring drives her crazy.

(cash register bell dings)

*

[rock music]

Girls,
I need your attention.

You also need a booster seat
for most places.

No, I came out
to tell you some big news.

You also came out
when you wore that sweater

to work today.

John Mayer wore
this sweater in Details.

Tonight, we are trying
family-style service.

I thought family-style service
was what I had to do

with my uncle.

Well, my family-style is
more "potluck"--

heavy on the pot,
not so heavy on the luck.

Why would a family come here?

If I see a child in here,
I'm calling the police.

It's like seeing a dog
locked in a hot car.

Chicken cacciatore ,
family-style.

Liver and onions,
family-style.

Spaghetti and meatballs,
my family-style,

which means the balls are
kinda small,

but the noodles
are extra long.

You bring out the food
in large bowls

and the customers
serve themselves,

as they've been doing
since I hired you two.

Good idea, Han.

The diner food
does belong in a big bowl--

the toilet bowl.

I don't know what
your uncle saw in you.

(Peter Bjorn and John)

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

Max, I just
found something

very upsetting
on my phone.

Another free U2 album?

Worse.

And worse than an e-vite
to a friend's improv show.

It's an e-mail
from the managing director

of all The High restaurants
saying he's seen our sales

and is disappointed
with my performance.

Duh-lete...

like I do with all

the "disappointed
in your performance" texts

I get from guys after sex.

Sorry, gents!
My boobs make a promise

my bad back can't deliver.

Those bad sales numbers
are not our fault.

Our unit's out
at the airport.

Well, I'm not taking
ownership of this

because my unit is not
at the airport.

It's in my bed table drawer.

I'm the manager.
It's on me.

As is this tartar stain.
It just refuses to come out.

You'd think
it's parents were Baptist.

[bell rings]

Well, Manager,
I need to get out of there

early tomorrow
to do Sophie's wedding cake,

and also because
you're annoying as a boss.

Hey, everybody!

Me, me, me, me,
me, me, me, me, me...

I love being a bride.
You don't even have to pretend

it's about anyone else.

Kinda like me,
when I was rich.

Pretty much
every single day still.

Good news, bad news.
The good news is

the rash is
not spreading past my nuts.

And that's the good news.

Bad news--
the wedding donkey we booked

for the church service died.

I'll ask
the obvious question.

Did it have anything
to do with the rash?

I mean, what are we gonna do?

It's not a traditional
Polish wedding

without an ass walking
down the aisle.

I think Oleg's
got that covered.

Girls, we need an ass,
you have a horse--

same family,
but not related,

like the Jolie-Pitt kids.

No way.
Chestnut is my baby.

Well, the donkey was getting
a thousand bucks.

Baby's gotta work.

[rock music]

Wow, business is slower
than the third season

of House of Cards.

You know what's doing
great business?

It's my new Grindr profile.

Changed my screen name
to "Suction Junction".

That damn Cinnabon next door
is taking all our business.

What kind of low lives
would prefer those

to these fine desserts?

I found a secret pathway
to the Cinnabon kitchen!

Move, bitch!

Really? You too?
I just don't get.

It's an acquired taste,
like crystal meth.

[cell phone chimes]

Ugh.

Great. My waiter's
gonna be late again.

"Held up at the TSA line."

That's what I get
for hiring an airport waiter

named Mohammed Machdinajihad.

Oh, look, Ronnie,
a new place.

I see it, Bonnie,
I'm right next to you.

Didn't this used to be
the bar we got wasted in

before our flights?

I can't remember.
I was wasted.

[both laugh]

Welcome to The High--

the finest
in high quality desserts.

We also have yogurts,
cappuccinos, lattes, coffee,

herb teas, or smart waters.

And did I mention
we're a Boingo Hotspot?

Take it down a notch.

You're selling it harder
than Anne Hathaway

on The Tonight Show.

Oh, hi, I'm not here to buy,
just to look.

On a diet...since 1998.

Oh dear lord,
those look amazing.

- Can I just smell a piece?
- Bonnie, don't.

It'll get you going,
and then halfway to Paris,

I'll find you in coach binging
on a bag of Sun Chips.

That's my favorite thing
about the job.

[both laughing]

Oh, Paris reminds me.

I bought two first class
tickets to Paris--

on three credit cards
that will escalate 20%

over six years--anyway...

I really need to return them.

What's the window
on that with your airline?

A month--about the same
amount of time I have

until this fake smile
finally falls off my face.

Lady, we're
flight attendants.

If that smile
falls off your face,

you're gonna have to
get a job at Southwest.

Why are you returning them?
You don't like Paris?

J'adore Paris,
but long story short--

Uh, I'll make it short
because she's incapable

and will throw in lots more
of that fake French.

Bought the tickets
so that I could get to the gate

to see a guy I was banging.

I hear ya.

I once hid in the luggage
cart for 12 hours

to do it
with this cute guy

who works at Customs here.

Oh, right. Rick.
What's he doing now?

Me, every third Tuesday.

[laughing]

Ahh, don't leave me
hanging, ladies.

Ah. If we hadn't
just read Lean In

in our wine club--
I mean book club--

We'd be real jealous
of you gals.

We always had a dream
to open a shop at the airport.

Well, whatever it is,
just don't open

near a Cinnabon
because failure smells

a hell of a lot
like cinnamon.

(female voice)
Final boarding call

for flight 24 to Paris.
Final boarding call.

Final boarding call?
We better hurry.

[both laughing]

[instrumental music]

Wow, everything looks
so much smaller in here

than I remembered it.

Like returning
to your old high school...

or your old high school
boyfriend's penis.

Not mine.
I went to an urban high school.

What's that weird smell?

Probably that milk.
It's been in here so long,

its own photo was
on the carton.

No, it's over here.
Really pungent.

Yes!

Mm--
I might owe you two some rent.

Unless you wanna settle
in weed.

I always wanna
settle in weed.

In fact, I plan
to retire there.

Marijuana's in the closet?

This is more shocking than
Meredith Baxter-Birney.

Look, I figured since you two
abandoned the cupcake shop,

this space was available.

Also, I stopped asking
permission for stuff

when I turned 70.

We did not abandon it.

We just haven't paid attention
to it in 3 months,

like me with any hair
above my mid-thigh.

Tell me about it.

When you bend over
in that skirt,

it looks like you're
giving birth to Art Garfunkel.

Me, me, me,
me, me, me, me!

Oh, good.
Earl, you're here.

Yes, I am.
Don't tell any of my ex-wives.

Earl, would you
do me the honor

and walk me down the aisle
tomorrow night?

Sophie, sorry.

I didn't know
your father was dead.

Did he die upon meeting Oleg?

Oh, he's not dead,

but I'm not getting
upstaged by an iron lung.

Well, Earl,
how could you say no

to such a heartfelt request?

I'd be honored, Sophie.

Like the wedding saying goes,

Something old,
something new,

something borrowed,

and someone black.

Oh, Caroline, look.

Here are the pink ribbons
for Chestnut.

Chestnut has to be
covered in girly ribbons?

I can't do that to my boy.

I'll throw in another 50.

I guess there's a reason
"horse" sounds

so much like "whore."

Now, we're all gonna leave
for the church at 6:00,

but I told Earl 4:00,

'cause, well...
You know.

- ¶ Mm-hm hm hmm ¶
- What's happening over there?

Max, you're humming!

[scoffs]
What?

[laughs]
Please...

I am not a hummer.

I mean,
I'll drive in them,

I'll give them,
but I am not one.

[continues humming]

Oh, my God, I am humming!
What's wrong with me?

What am I gonna do next,
smile?

That's right!
Today's special promotion,

in and out in five minutes
or your dessert is half off.

Eat it, Cinnabon.

Pear tart and a coffee.
Come on, I'm on a clock here.

Who had the damn pear tart
and a coffee?

Max, hurry!
Five minutes, in and out!

Yeah, the one thing
you don't have to explain

to me is "in and out."

I need help!
I never said I was fast.

All my high school
guidance counselors did,

but I did not.

I'll go get John
off break

because my waiter
still isn't here.

This whole Middle East
situation

is just so inconvenient
for me.

Okay, now we have
a real situation.

You hit someone.
Damn it, Max.

It's not about me.
It's Sophie.

Her gown arrived
from Poland

and it's stuck
in customs out here.

(Sophie on phone)
My gown!

My beautiful gown!

[screaming]
Oh, my God! My gown!

Wow.
She is really upset.

Really upset,

'cause this isn't
even on speaker.

Yes, it's awful,
but look on the bright side.

Our certain-to-be-hideous
bridesmaids dresses

are stuck in customs too.

No, those arrived.

Damn it!
First, it's the Middle East,

now those dresses.

I cannot catch a break.

Wow, this place is packed.

Remember us?
Bonnie and Ronnie?

We knew you when.

Hey, wait, uh, Ronnie,

didn't you say that
you boned a guy in customs?

That was Bonnie.
I have standards...

and he didn't like me.

To be clear, I did have sex
with the customs guy,

but not in customs.

It was in one of
those family bathrooms.

Look, is there any way
you could help us

get a package out of customs?

Wait...
What bra am I wearing?

Oh, done!

[both laugh]

John, we're leaving.
You're in charge.

Max!
We can't leave right now.

The wedding's not till tonight
and we're in the middle

of a store promotion
and we're losing.

You know I'm
gonna kill you, right?

I just have
to figure out how.

Top contender
is hooking your necklace

on the front gate
and pushing up.

We'll stay
as late as possible.

Just pick up Sophie's dress box
and hop on the subway.

Easy peasy.

(male announcer)
Watch the closing doors, please.

[struggling]
Ugh--oho...

Why is nothing easy peasy?

¶ ¶

¶ ¶

(male voice)
Watch the closing doors, please.

I am watching the doors!

It's hard not to.
They're about to eat my box.

[laughing]

[mocking laugh]

Yeah, real funny, sir.

A girl said, "Eat my box."
Grow up.

[whimper] Jeez!
How could a dress be this big?

This is just the veil.

I have to get something
out of my bag.

Hold this by yourself
for a second.

[groans]

I can't find it.
Here, take this.

What is this?

A hundred dollars in change.

We need it for the wedding.
It's a Polish custom

to throw change at the bride.

Loose change?
Live animals?

Is this a wedding
or a cock fight?

Max, this is heavy!

What do you have
to get out of your bag?

- Something important.
- What is it?

The rest of my Cinnabon.

Max, that's our competition!

The reason for our failure
is that piece of crap.

I mean, I ca--

Oh, my God,
this is delicious!

No! Max,
he's got the money bag.

[yelp]
[scattering coins]

No--
No! No, no, no!

That is
our Polish bride money!

Back off!

This is not the day
to the screw with me.

I'm at the business bottom

and I've had nothing
to lose since 2011.

[screeching brakes]
[loud clunk]

(male voice)
Queen's Plaza.

Yup. That's what
would happen next.

[rock music]

¶ ¶

What's the hold up
back there?

People are placing bets
that I'm halfway to Reno

with a hooker
and the wedding cash.

Relax.
After that subway,

Max and Caroline needed
some time to freshen up.

They came smelling
like that diner cheese

I tell you all is still good.

Hey, everybody!

We look just like Sophie!
I am so relieved.

I thought I'd be way overdressed
but I'm just under-boobed.

Yeah, we were in a hurry

or I would have loaned her
a cup of mine.

All right.

Oleg, stop looking
at us like that.

It's okay.
I'm marrying you.

You guys look
like the Four Tops.

Well, two tops
and a bottom.

Oleg, Sophie doesn't
want you to see her.

Jump on Chestnut
and start down the aisle.

And Chestnut,
I'm sorry, baby.

I know you never wanted
to do drag.

And, Han, you're supposed
to take this

in case something happens
in the aisle.

This just went
from best man to worst job.

[bombastic music]

¶ ¶

¶ Hey! ¶

Hi.

What do you think, girls?

Do I look like a virgin?

[horns sound]

I heard the tubas.
That's my cue! Go, girls. Go!

[brassy folk music]

¶ ¶

¶ ¶

Oh, God!

Her dress
almost killed us

and now it killed Earl.

[gasps]
Thanks.

I thought
I was a goner.

[organ music]

Time for the vows.

Bring the crowns!

And crowned is married...

[drawn out]
with honor.

Ohhh...

Raise the crowns
to their heads.

Better go.
This is as good as

it's gonna get
without a ladder.

I, Sophie Kachinsky...

take you, Oleg Golishevsky

to love and to cherish,

to have and to hold,

never to leave your side

'til death comes to take me.

I, Oleg Golishevsky,

take you,
Sophie Kachinsky,

to love and to cherish,

to have and to hold,

never to leave your side

'til death comes to take me.

I pronounce you
husband and wife!

[applause]

Max,
now you throw the coins.

[coins clunking faintly]

Long story.

Wow, girl,
your fingers work fast.

[giggles]
Must be from years

of opening those 501
button-fly jeans...

Mine and others'.

Max, I'm done waiting.
I need that piece

of cake right now.

We just had a close call
in the air.

So close, we gave
the finger to the pilot

in the plane next to us.

We almost crashed,
and I didn't wanna

go down screaming,

"I should have
opened a daycare center!"

I usually go down screaming,
"You didn't buy me dinner!"

Bonnie, let's admit it.

We're never gonna
go for our dream,

just like we never went
to get those colonics.

If we really wanted
our own business,

we would have done it already,
like Max and Caroline did.

You're right, we did.

John,
cut these two the biggest piece

of coconut
macadamia nut cake we have.

Oh my god.
I think I just climaxed.

Well, then pull
your panties on

and slink the hell out
like you usually do.

[both laugh]

Caroline, I need to talk to you.

What are you doing?

Working!
I'm very sick.

Bonnie and Ronnie out there just
reminded me of something.

I mean, besides two aunts
drunk on vacation.

We have our own business.
The High isn't our failure.

We already have
our very own failure

called Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

And if we stay here,
we're building

someone else's dream,
not ours.

Also, if we stay,

your ass will be
the size of a house.

I mean, when was the last time
you felt happy here?

Like 30 seconds ago
when you said this place

wasn't our failure
and I remembered I was holding

another one of these
in my other hand.

Let's get out of this airport.

We never have to see another
Nicholas Sparks novel again.

First, we have to get rid

of those two plane tickets
to Paris.

Do we?

I mean, if we're gonna fail

we can still do that after
a week in Paris, right?

Right.

I'm so stoked!
I've never been in first class.

Except, Max,
this is coach.

I got a refund on one ticket
and traded in the other

to buy two coach tickets
and to pay for a cheap hotel.

I'm so stoked.
I've never been in coach.

[giggles]
And also so

we have money to spend.

We should be able
to do Paris for a week on $12.

Of course, we can.

What's the difference between
coach and first, anyway?

The champagne.

We'll be back
with the good crackers,

and I don't mean us.

[both laugh]

Well, partner,
after all we've been

through this year,
whatever comes next,

I kinda feel ready for it.

(Bonnie)
Flight crew, prepare
for take-off.

[humming]

Hey, now you're humming.

I am?

Hey, can I trade this in
for a beer?

Look at that.
Dogs in the diner.

Where are we, Paris?

'Cause if we are, I'm gonna
stop wearing deodorant.

Did you guys see
that adorable dog?

You mean the one leaking
rabies all over the table

while people
are trying to eat?

She said
he's allowed to be in here.

He's her registered
emotional companion.

Her registered
full-of-crap what?

He's got one of those
official vests that says

"don't pet me,
I'm working."

I have a shirt that says
"federal bikini inspector,"

but there is simply no such
branch of the U.S. government.

Hi, so, uh,
what the hell is this?

Excuse me?
I don't understand.

Dogs aren't allowed
in the diner.

Oh, he's legally allowed
to be here.

He's my registered
emotional companion.

You mean you don't
have a boyfriend.

No,
I suffer from anxiety.

You mean you don't
want to eat alone.

No, I have a note
from a doctor.

You mean you have a printer
and the Internet.

Admit it,
and the dog can stay.

It's really hard
meeting guys.

There's a good boy.
I'll get you a cookie.

Is it just me,
or does Han sound kind of sexy

when he speaks korean?

Looks like Han,
sounds like Barry White.

Who was that, Han?

Do you have a hot,
new korean girlfriend?

Yeah, someone
who really likes you

and is $1.50
for the first minute

and $2 for each
additional minute?

I was talking
to my mother!

So... yes?

I was not talking hot.
I was apologizing.

She's still angry
I left home.

Does she know you buy
your sweaters at build-a-bear?

Well, I don't know
a lot about the korean culture,

but maybe you should
stand up for yourself

and stop apologizing
to your mother.

Yeah, what do you
even have to apologize for?

You must have been
the easiest birth ever.

She could've coughed you
into a catcher's mitt.

I'm making a cappuccino,
you want one?

Nope, I can't have
any caffeine.

I have to keep my system clean.
I'm doing a drug trial tomorrow.

Max,
not one of those places

where they use you
as a Guinea pig

to test for side effects
of new drugs

that go on the market?

Or, as I like to call it,
getting paid $500

to, uh, roll
the side effects dice

and hope it lands
on hallucinations.

I would never
do something like that.

I consider
my body a temple.

Didn't I see
your "temple" eat a bag

of flaming hot cheetos
two nights ago?

And that
was a huge mistake.

I still have a little...

Burny heinie.

And besides, think of
all the people who are

lowering their cholesterol
safely because of me.

Or the people who aren't
taking klamitra because of me.

I never
heard of klamitra.

You're welcome.

I know klamitra.

Sexy black woman
who teaches my spin class.

Uh, hello, uh,
maybe you can help me.

I'm looking
for Caroline channing.

I have a legal matter
to discuss with her.

Never heard of her.
Never seen her.

- Mr. hutchinson?
- Never took an oath.

Oh, my God,
Mr. hutchinson, hi.

I haven't seen you
since my father's scandal broke

and they were dragging you
out of your law offices.

Can I hug you?
I mean, it's been so long

since I've seen anyone
from my old life.

But, uh,
not too hard.

Ever since the scandal,
I've had acid reflux.

Didn't you
used to be taller?

No, uh, prouder.

Oh, uh, Mr. hutchinson,
this is my friend, Max.

Max, this is Leo hutchinson,
one of my father's attorneys.

Oh, I've never
known a lawyer

who wasn't
court-appointed for me.

Well, except for
the ones on law & order.

Have you ever
been on that show?

No,
I'm a real lawyer.

You look like someone
who was on that show.

Are you sure
you didn't represent

the woman
who ate her child?

I've never represented
anyone who ate their child.

On law & order.

Caroline, I'm sorry
to drag you into this,

but the prosecutor is asking
for you to give a deposition

regarding
your father's case.

Anything I can do to help?
I'm pretty courtroom savvy.

I mean, I haven't seen
every episode of law & order,

just, like, 400 of them.

For instance,
the, uh, judge's hammer?

Not called a hammer.

Reflux! Oh!

Sorry.

I just... I need to
take a rylindia.

Ah, rylindia.
Does that work?

- Hmm.
- You're welcome.

Well, thank you for coming
all the way out here.

I know I'm in good hands
with you representing me.

Uh, well, Caroline, as much
as I would love to help you

and your
legal associate here,

uh, the firm won't let me
do it for free.

I mean, your father's case
bankrupted us practically,

and my standard rate
is $1,100 an hour.

You know I don't have
that kind of money.

Last week,
I gave myself a bikini wax

with duct tape
I stole from the diner.

I'm gonna need
another rylindia.

Oh, don't take two of those
in under an hour

unless you want to have
an orgasm every time you yawn.

You're welcome again.

Mr. hutchinson,
I need you to do this.

You can make this go away
as easily as possible.

Please don't
make me beg.

The floor's gross,
and my skirt's too short.

Counselor,
at this juncture,

I am going to need to
take miss channing

and have a sidebar
over near the bar bar.

How fun is this,
by the way?

I'm, like,
your lawyer now.

Oh, real fun.
About as fun as that bikini wax.

And then I had to spend $14
on neosporin.

Don't worry, I know how you
can make $500 in one night.

I've been telling her that
since she got here.

Max, I am not
doing a drug trial.

Besides,
it's not enough money anyway.

No, but after
I put in my $500,

plus we take $100
from the cupcake fund.

You would do that
for me?

You know, I always thought
we'd have to use

the cupcake money to get us
out of a legal problem.

I just thought
it'd be for you.

Me too!

Welcome aboard,
drug buddy.

I can't believe
I'm doing a drug trial.

I won't even use stevia.

It'll be fun!

Just think of it as
a middle-school sleepover.

But with drugs.

Yeah,
a middle-school sleepover.

So when
you did this before,

you never got
any side effects, right?

Well, no negative ones.
I used to be an "a" cup.

Wow, everybody
looks so normal.

This is more like
sorority row than skid row.

Hi!
I'm Katie.

Just found out
there's three to a room,

and I was wondering if you guys
have chosen a roomie yet.

Wait, there's three
in a room?

Yeah, I know.

You want to be careful
who you get.

Anyways,
I'm a self-mutilator,

and, um, I was wondering if
you could keep an eye on me.

Just wrestle anything
out of my hands that's sharp.

Uh,
you know what, Katie?

We are
self-mutilators too.

So, uh, we kind of
have our hands full.

Yeah,
we're gonna be super-busy

self-mutilating ourselves.

No worries.

Max, you should have told me
about the bed situation.

Untested experimental drugs
is one thing,

but three to a room?
That's barbaric!

It'll be fine!

We just have to pick
the right girl.

What about, uh,
the one in the raincoat?

She looks stuck-up,

like she'd talk
about herself all night.

Yeah, we already
got one of those.

What about, uh...

What about
Bob Marley shirt?

She looks like
she smells.

- Confirmed.
- Right there.

That's who we want.
She looks smart

and like she'd
mind her own business.

Hey!
What are you up to?

Nothing.
Just minding my own business.

Hey, want to be
our roommate?

Oh, I just said yes
to a self-mutilator,

but I can get out of it.

She probably
loves rejection.

All right,
ladies, listen up!

- Hey, Max!
- Hi, Toby.

Heads-up,
me, her, and, uh...

Excuse me,
what's your name?

Oh, it's cool,

we don't have to do,
like, the name thing.

A girl after my own heart!

- We're roommates.
- Got it.

Now, since most of you
have done this before,

I'll make it quick.

Half of you
will get a placebo.

The other half will be a testing
a new drug called gladiva,

and no, that's not my stage name
down at the clubs.

Okay,
possible side effects

may occur over
the next 24 to 48 hours.

They are...
Drum roll please...

Headaches,
vomiting, flatulence,

tongue-swelling,
suicidal thoughts...

I'm having some
right now.

- Itw...
- Inability to walk.

Mm, I hope we get that
'cause that's the only thing

that's gonna keep me here.

And ru...

Relentless urination.

Fatigue, seizures...

Camel toe.

I'm kidding.
That's my joke.

That's his joke.

Good,
'cause I was out the door.

Also, tg,
eb, ccs...

You want me
to explain those to you?

Not until you see one
happening to me.

And A.L.

Anal leakage.

The Grande Dame
of side effects.

Well, bottoms up.

Max, don't say that
after "anal leakage."

See? This is fun!

Getting paid to eat cookies
and play the game of life.

- Your turn.
- What's the point?

Clearly, I've already
lost the game of life

'cause I'm sitting
in a drug trial

waiting for
my "A" to "L".

Well, if your "A"
does start to "L,"

you're on the bottom bunk.

I gotta pee.

Ruh-roh.

What?

Mm,
it's probably nothing,

but she might be
experiencing ru.

What's that again?

Relentless urination.

She just said
she had to pee.

Yeah,
that's relentless.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

"Ru" sure?

Okay,
your turn to spin.

No more games.

I really want to be prepared
for this deposition.

Can you read me the questions
Mr. hutchinson sent?

Mm-hmm.

"State your full name."

Caroline Wesbox Channing.

Your middle name
is "Wesbox"?

It was
my grandfather's name.

It also might be
a side effect.

"I just slept with a dude
who gave me Wesbox!"

Max, can you just ask me
the next question?

Do you have any owledge
of investor capital

from the channing
investment group

being transferred
to offshore banks?

I had
no knowledge of it.

- You're boring.
- I'm boring?

I'm just saying,
I'd change the channel.

This is a bad one.

Max,
it's not law & order.

I'll say it isn't.

Look, tomorrow,
you gotta give them something.

Open your shirt,
hike up your skirt,

show them your Wesbox.

"Did you know anything
about your father

- "illegally siphoning funds?"
- No.

"Have you ever had
any conversations

with your father regarding
said transactions?"

No.

"Is your ass leaking
right now?"

No.

Ruh-roh.

Nope.

How we doing, ladies?

Any side effects?

Max, are you awake?

Max!

Quiet, you're gonna
wake up pissy spacek.

I can't sleep.
My hearts keeps racing.

You should tell Toby.
It's probably a side effect.

No, I'm nervous.

I can't stop thinking
about the deposition

and about my father.
Can I come down and talk?

Not a great time.
I kind of have people over.

Get in here.
What's wrong?

I'm scared
about tomorrow.

I'm scared I'm gonna say
the wrong thing

and make things worse
for my father.

Look, all you have to do
is answer the questions

as carefully as they suggested
and then throw in a wink,

forget to wear panties.
He'll be fine.

But that's the thing.

The questions don't say
anything about my father.

They're so cut and dry.

They're only asking me
details about things

I know nothing about,

and they're not interested in
the things I do know about him.

That he's warm, and funny,
and generous, and loving.

Like when I was little,
and he and I

would take our plane
to our chalet in deer valley.

Stop. You might as well
rephrase that to

"when he and I
would take our guilty

to our guilty
in guilty valley."

Every morning,
before we went skiing,

he would get up
really early and make me

his snowflake
cinnamon french toast.

Sounds amazing.

And as he dusted
the cinnamon and sugar on top,

he'd say,
"look, sweetheart, it's snowing,

snowing just for you."

And then he'd cut it
into these little pieces...

See? I can't even
get the words out.

No one will ever hear them.
No one will know.

I'll know.
I heard them.

Another round?

Yeah, I'm just gonna
bring my pillow in there.

I don't think Gladiva's
gonna make it to the market.

We'll be doing
the deposition in here.

Oh, wow, this is exactly
how it looks on law & order!

Ooh! Ooh!

There's the tiny
typewriter thing

where the actress
who never gets to speak sits!

Leo, Leo, take my picture
near the tiny typewriter.

Ladies, ladies.
We only have an hour.

We're already behind
because you were late.

Sorry, we had to stop
at the check-cashing place.

Yeah, and then a store
to get diapers for a friend.

There, $1,000.

No fuss,
and luckily, no muss.

Max, do you have
the $100 from the cupcakes?

Yeah.

Uh, 40... 60...
80... 90...

5, 6, 7, and...

100.

Mr. hutchinson,
are you having reflux?

No, I-it just became clear
to me what I do for a living.

Okay, uh, Caroline,

if you're ready,
I can bring them in.

Remember,
just stick to the questions

and don't embellish.

I prepped her
last night, Leo.

All right,
let's go, Max.

Actually,
I want her to stay.

I'm nervous,
and she makes me feel better.

Yes, I'm her registered
emotional companion.

Well, this is
a legal proceeding,

and that's
a highly unusual request.

But not improbable.
We googled it.

Yeah, she's allowed to have
an emotional companion,

as long as
both attorneys agree.

Well, I graduated
top of my class at Harvard,

but since you googled it,
I'll try to make that happen.

No, I am unaware
of any of the transactions

you just mentioned.

Thank you,
miss channing.

Now, if you'll just bear with me
a little while longer,

I only have a couple more
pertinent questions.

Your voice
is unbelievable.

You could be
on law & order.

Max!

Withdrawn.

Miss channing,
do you have any knowledge

of embezzlement
of any kind taking place

at the channing
investment group?

No,
I had no knowl...

Of any su...

Could you repeat that?

Ruh-roh.

You're having
a side effect!

Tongue swelling.
Ts!

Uh, counselor,
give us one second.

What is going on?

We took drugs.

Did she just say
"we took drugs"?

Very good, Leo.
You must play charades.

Look, we did a drug trial
to get money for this.

What's the holdup,
counselor?

Just give her some water.
I had this once.

It goes away in an hour.

You said you never had

any side effects!

Oh, please.
I died once.

I just didn't want
to scare you.

Miss channing,
are you aware of any accounts

opened under any names
other than your father's?

Just drink the water.

One sec.

Uh, does anyone have
a napkin or a bib?

$1,100, you gotta have a bib
around here somewhere.

All right,
what's going on here?

I was just, uh,
informed my client

was part of a drug test
within the last 24 hours.

Drug test, Leo?
That's a good one.

Just another
rich girl on drugs.

Get her into rehab,
and we'll have to reschedule.

We'll have to do this
another time.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

No, no!
She's right!

We don't have the money
to do this another Tim

look, I can tell you right now,
she does not know anything.

She doesn't know
about the money,

she doesn't know
about transactions.

She doesn't know
anything about anything.

We are paid up
for three more minutes,

and we are going to
use them!

She can't talk, but I know
what she would want to say.

Ladies and gentlemen
of the... room,

she would want you to know
who her father really is.

He used to make her
snow toast!

And in her words,
he was funny, smart,

and a generous lover.

Generous and loving!

Oh, sorry, yes, yes.
Generous and loving.

Now, I don't know her father,
and I have never met him...

And I would like you
to put that on the record,

actress who's never
allowed to talk...

But I do know her,
and she's an amazing person.

And her father
raised her alone,

so he must be
an amazing person too.

Well...

That accomplished nothing.

Counselor,
what do we do here?

We take a short recess
until she can speak,

and resume
the deposition, on me,

because her father
is an amazing guy, and...

That's what they would do
on law & order.

Fine,
we'll break for an hour.

Seriously, you sound like
a superhero's boss.

Max, you're the best.

I know.
I did pretty good, right?

I should've gone
to law school.

Or High School.

Permission to enter
the judge's chambers?

Permission granted.
Excuse the tubs of bleu cheese.

They're being held
as evidence

in the case
against eating here.

I wanted to thank you
for everything you did.

And I know you were gonna
buy yourself a treat

with the drug money...

Yeah, like drugs.

So I got you
a little something.

It's the complete
law & order box set!

No way!

That's not a little something.
That's, like, $500.

Or $30 on the subway.

And the guy said
most of them are in english.

Awesome!

Freezer adjourned.

Listen up.

Max and Caroline are at
a big Hollywood premiere.

They say Harrison Ford is there.

Tell Han Solo, "Hello from Han."

Who always does it solo.

Yeah, this place is
crawling with celebs.

Everyone's here.

Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett,
Amy Schumer's sister.

If you see Burt Reynolds,
tell him I have his belt.

Snap some boob pics.

Some A-list D's or some B-list C's.

I can't. My phone's dead.

But you're on your phone.

Big ruckus here.

Matt Damon just threw a
puff pastry at Don Cheadle.

How bout we FaceTime?

Can't. No reception.

But we're talking to you right now.

Well, I gotta go.

Julia Roberts wants to split an UberX.

I feel bad lying to Han.

I mean, he's already been
catfished three times this year.

To be fair, two of those times were me.

And we're not really lying.

We could have gone to
that Hollywood party

if we wanted to.

- And had been invited.
- Hmm.

And hadn't been kicked out by security.

We're still on the line.

We can never go back there.

So nice of your new man

to send us a pressed juice basket.

So LA.

So gross!

I love them. They're disgusting.

This one's like licking
a beet's undercarriage.

Still, it was really
thoughtful of Randy.

He must really like you,

and really want you to stay regular.

Yeah, someone really buried the lead

on this whole being treated well thing,

and I miss him.

You saw him 30 minutes ago.

Feels like 35.

What is that about? Do I have shingles?

Oh, my God. I just got an e-mail.

The world's most in-demand
actress is on her way over

to talk about playing me
in the movie of my life.

Betty White's coming here?

It's Jennifer Lawrence!

Amy Schumer's sister's best friend.

The studio just set it up.

She wants to meet me to
see if she digs my vibe.

Oh, wish I had my vibe.

They wouldn't let me
bring it on the plane.

What was I gonna do?

Terrorize everyone with pleasure?

Oh, I better go brush my teeth.

I don't want Jennifer Lawrence to think

I licked a cantaloupe's armpit.

The star of "The Hunger
Games" is coming here?

We will have lots in common.

I mean, I've killed kids for food.

Hey, everybody.

Does anyone know how to shut off
the fire alarm in the elevator?

'Cause this sage is really popping off.

Hey, puff puff pass.

Ah, you don't smoke it.

No, it cleans your aura
or some crap like that.

Well, that sounds spiritual.

Oh, you know, my healer says

the reason that I haven't
been able to get pregnant

is that my aura is filthier

than my gynecologist's Instagram.

Yeah.

But I did get a lot of likes.

Ugh, Sophie,

I'm getting second hand hippie.

Hey.

Sophie, I have got to
get this out of here

or Jennifer Lawrence will
think this is my vibe.

I'm going for Grace
Kelly not Woody Harrelson.

Well, that's a mistake.

You know what?

My healer, Audra, gave
me a whole list of things

that I need to do in
order to get pregnant.

Is one of them, "Have
sex the front way"?

Yeah, also, "Eat apples, meditate,

cut down on cigars."

She also said that I have to practice

loving kindness with everyone.

Even the people who
trigger my negativity.

Yeah, but you know what?

I'm as sweet as the sugar substitute

that gave half my family cancer, yeah.

You're maybe not always

sweet as sugar substitute to everyone.

I'm not?

Well, here comes this idiot.

You know what?

I'm gonna be real nice to
you so that I can have a baby.

So I don't care what
kind of crap comes out

of your stupid pie hole.

Oh, my God, I'm a monster.

Oh, my God, do you think
that's Jennifer Lawrence?

That was fast. What a star.

Prompt and she costs less than a man.

Or maybe it's Randy. It's
been a whole 38 minutes.

39.

Aww, that's making me horny.

Yeah, and that's not on my list.

I came over to tell you I
can't stay the night tonight.

I gotta go to Miami.

My client's causing trouble
on the new Johnny Depp movie.

My client's Johnny Depp.

Is it another "Pirates" movie?

'Cause I'm only four
hours into the last one.

Caroline Channing's office.

This is her assistant
Tiesha. Please hold.

I gave myself an assistant
'cause I deserve one.

Oh, yeah, there it is.

Oh, my God, I'm getting triggered.

Oh, man.

My dog sitter just quit.

She married Eddie Murphy.

Now I don't have anybody to watch Bruno.

Oh, I can watch Bruno.

Would you want to stay
with him at my place?

At your beautiful house in the hills

with an amazing view
of the Hollywood sign?

Ugh, fine, but only
'cause I really want to.

Okay, so unfortch J Law
got swarmed by the paps

so she has to reschedj.

Oh, boy.

I picked the wrong week
to quit smoking cigars.

Randy, that view is so amazing.

We're so close I can see the
"ho" of the Hollywood sign.

And I bet it's saying, "I can
see the ho of Williamsburg."

Wow, this place is gorgeous.

The last guy Max dated
had a mattress on the floor

and a lady named Sheila
living in the crawl space.

Caroline, are you trying
to make me jealous?

Oh, you have nothing to worry about.

There's no way that guy's still alive.

Look, the next 24 hours,

just treat this place like it's yours.

Don't worry, I will take
really good care of Bruno.

I'll let him sleep right in the hills.

I haven't been this jealous of my dog

since I saw him licking
his own balls every day.

Randy, would you say
it's private up here?

Like private enough to have
a meeting with a celebrity

who I'm not at will to name,

but it's Jennifer Lawrence.

Yeah, it's really quiet up here.

Just one neighbor up the hill.

Old guy. Rocks the hell
out of a stained sweat suit.

We get along great.

We've never spoken.

I can't get a signal.
What's your Wi-Fi password?

1, 2, 5, lowercase B,

uppercase D, dash, dash, 6, 3,

lowercase F, uppercase F, 5, 2, 1.

Or you can get some reception outside.

All right, I gotta go.

Come here, big boy.

Who's Daddy's big boy? Yes.

That call works on me too, FYI.

Come here, big boy.

Mmm.

Caroline, where's the best reception?

Behind the hedge down the hill
near this big cactus and... ow!

Ooh, getting a little
heat on this table.

I'm gonna call the diner.

Hey, Max, how's my girl?

Are you rich, famous,
and driving a Prius yet?

Earl, you would not
believe where we are.

I am looking down on all of LA.

Oh, I'm doing that from here.

Ask Max if she talked to Sophie.

I didn't get an up the
skirt selfie this morning

and I'm worried.

I got it by accident.

And I'm hoping talking about it

will somehow free me from it.

Can you forward it to me?

You know what? Just take my phone.

I'll buy a new one.

Ow.

Whoa! Stop...

blowing. Stop blowing.

Blowing...

Thank you!

So how would you rate the LA blow job

compared to the ones in New York?

This one was less work.

When Jennifer Lawrence
gets here to interview me,

just know, I'm also
kind of interviewing her.

I mean, I know she has my looks,

but does she have my naiveté?

Is that French for "small boobs"?

Max, I know I said this
at the airport Arby's,

but I could totally see you living here.

Thanks, girl.

I could totally see you visiting us.

And look at this TV from the future.

Where are the cords?

And watch this. Television...

give me Samuel L. Jackson.

Finding Samuel L. Jackson.

Wow, he's in every movie.

He's like the black Kevin Bacon.

Dude, can you believe my life?

And you saw that pool out there.

You don't even have to blow it up.

Let's go look at it again.

Excuse me, Antonio? Could
you water that cactus?

It's looking a little dry.

That didn't sound rude
to the help, did it?

I don't want to be that person.

Meaning you.

Okay, Jennifer Lawrence
will be here any minute,

and, Max, I have to say,

I'm having the best hair day ever.

I was having the best hair day ever.

Dude, Jennifer Lawrence
took a helicopter here.

That is so baller.

No, it's probably the
paparazzi following her.

Leave us be! We're just trying to live!

This is the police!

There is a dangerous
criminal in the area.

We're looking for Walter Gary Vance.

Everyone, go inside.

This entire area is on lockdown.

No one will be allowed
to pass the roadblock.

What're you doing?

Uh, there's a serial
killer on the loose.

I'm doing what all heroes do.

I'm going on Twitter
to add to the chatter.

Okay, I'm running to my
cactus to call J Law's people

and make sure she doesn't come out here.

Stop!

Don't go out there.

According to Twitter,

the murder is a cannibal,

and also according to Twitter,

Khloe Kardashian is feeling the burn.

Oh, my God, a cannibal?

We have to get inside.

I have this terrible
feeling I'm delicious.

So, here we are.

Safe inside

in a house made of glass

on stilts

in a city long overdue
for an earthquake.

Ah.

We thought you were a crazy murderer.

I'm not crazy, but I could just

murder a cheese plate right now.

Oh, wow.

The hills are so exclusive.

I mean, it's all blocked off.

I haven't jumped this many hurdles

since the '84 Olympics.

Sophie, what're you doing here?

Jennifer Lawrence's people
were trying to reach you,

so they called the hotel,

and to show you some love and kindness,

I came all the way here to tell you.

Yeah. Do you think
that will get me a baby?

Not sure, but you can get a baby
for 80 bucks on the dark web.

And it comes with two outfits.

What did Jennifer's people say?

I don't know.

So, you just came up here
to tell me that they called,

but you didn't, like,
listen to the words?

Oh, it's never enough for you, is it?

Ohm.

Ohm.

Ohm getting tired of meditating,

but I think it's working.

Ohm...

Jennifer Lawrence is
probably freaking out

that she can't get to me.

The world doesn't
revolve around you, bitch.

Ohm... ohm.

I can't just stand here anymore.

I'm going outside to get a signal.

You know what else you can get outside?

Ya face eaten.

Well, I'm gonna go risk the life I have

to go get the life I want.

Sounds like a trailer
for a Liam Neeson movie.

Finding Liam Neeson.

Good luck.

That guys been taken more
times than my virginities.

All right, I got a signal

and a warning growl from a coyote,

but I talked to Jennifer
Lawrence's people,

and she and I are gonna
FaceTime in 20 minutes.

If you still have a face.

Where's Bruno?

Maybe he's back there in the sauna

like a little hot dog.

Where's my big boy?

Um, seriously, where's my big boy?

You didn't leave the door open, did you?

No.

I'm sure he's in here somewhere.

Bruno? Bruno?

Bruno?

Bruno?

Finding "Bruno."

Max, I'm really sorry.

Maybe we could replace the dog

with one that looks exactly the same.

Like men here do with wives.

Or maybe we don't assume
he's dead after six seconds

and we go out there and find him.

Okay, good luck.

You are coming with me.

Randy loves Bruno,

and I lo-uh-ike Randy.

Don't think I didn't
hear what you almost said.

- We need to find the dog.
- But it's getting dark

and there's someone out
there who wants to kill us.

Trust me, there's someone in
there who wants to kill you.

Flashlights. We need flashlights.

You lo-uh-ike him.

Now there are two people in
here who want to kill you.

Come here, big boy.

God, how could he have gotten
this far on such little legs?

I don't know, Danny DeVito
seems to get around a lot.

Even when you tell Randy
this is 100% your fault,

he is still gonna break up with me.

Max, you've been with him four days.

I know, it's my longest relationship.

I'm really sorry, Max. We'll find him.

Oh, my God!

- What, you see Bruno?
- No, I see bars on my phone.

We have to stay right here.

It's almost time for my FaceTime.

Give me that stupid thing.

I'll put it down my pants.

And I'll go get it.

You gotta focus

and help me find that dog.

I don't want to ruin things with Randy

or his house.

Max, this is so far past boundaries.

Oh, don't talk to me about boundaries.

Who let the dog out? Who?

Who-who-who-who?

As I said to Kevin Burlington
my sophomore year of college,

"Just take it."

This is serious.

Randy has given me so much.

Sunglasses, gift baskets,

an orgasm with eye contact.

- Oh, my God.
- I know.

Usually, I have to push their face away.

No, look.

We're at the foot of the Hollywood sign.

Quick selfie?

I mean, we have to, right?

On the way back, once we find the dog.

Which we are definitely going to do.

Jennifer Lawrence is calling.

Did you just hang up on J Law?

I'm pretty sure that's
against the J Law.

You're out here because
you lost Randy's dog,

and there's a strange
man standing over there,

and all you can think
about is Jennifer Lawrence.

Did you just say there's a
strange man standing over there?

Oh, my God, I did.

Look...

See there, the old guy
in the stained sweat suit.

Oh, he must be Randy's neighbor.

What's he doing out here?

Oh, you found Bruno!

It's so funny, for a second

I thought he was the cannibal murderer.

Oh, my God, he has a knife.

Maybe he's just opening packages.

Come here. Come here, big boy.

- Uh... run, Max!
- Come here, big boy.

- Come on.
- Nothing to eat here.

I'm stringy and chewy.

Quick!

Quick, up here!

Maybe the helicopters will see us.

Yeah, and if not,

we can throw ourselves off the O.

I refuse to get eaten by an old man...

without a bank account.

Can cannibals climb?

Well, they're not called
"climbables," so that's good.

Is he still there?

Well, we'll know in a second

'cause you're screaming within earshot

of a hungry people-eater.

You are surrounded! Put your hands up!

Max, the police are here.

We're safe. We're safe.

Speak for yourself.

I'm technically under
house arrest in Connecticut.

I let him eat ice cream.

He deserves it.

Who had a rough day yesterday?

I am really sorry, Randy.

You must think I'm as
irresponsible as I am.

This is where you cry

and tell him it's all
you and I'm perfect.

Sorry, I was just thinking,

that dogs gums and teeth
look healthier than mine.

I still can't believe my neighbor

was Walter Gary Vance the cannibal.

And honestly, it was way worse
living next to Courtney Love.

I mean, it's not that hard.

Blue bins are for recycling,

Tuesdays are street cleaning,

Don't do heroin on my porch.

Yeah, that's a driveway sport.

Look, Bruno's gotten out before,

but the fact that you went
out there to look for him

and risked your lives.

I mean, you were fearless.

Pfft, whatever. Maybe a little.

Ugh, great. Jennifer
Lawrence just passed.

She's dead?

No, she passed on the movie.

It's her loss.

Well, it's your loss,
but I feel like I owe you

for risking your life to
find my boyfriend's dog.

Not that you're my boyfriend,

'cause gross.

I'd be lucky to be your boyfriend.

If I was, which yuck, I'm not.

Hey, everybody.

Look, I'm spiritually evolved now.

Yeah, you know, the meditating
was screwing up my knees,

so I bought this getup
from an Indian woman

at a bus stop.

Yeah, it's a lot easier.

Sophie, those flowers are beautiful.

Yeah...

and they're for you.

What're they gonna do to me?

They're an act of love and kindness.

Sophie, that's literally

the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

Oh, yeah.

I don't know if it's my aura's clean,

or it's the 12.95 Bindi dot I'm wearing,

but I really do mean it.

Oh, Sophie, no. That's dog ice cream.

Mind your own business, bitch!

And we're back.

Earl, can you break some 20's?

The big spenders at table two

wanna split their $11 check three ways,

even though one person
did all the eating.

I was in a three-way once.
Same thing happened.

Max, table ten would like the check.

And don't forget to pick
up customer comment card.

Customers very important.

It's all about the fans.

Yeah, I'm not a fan of hearing
what people have to say.

For instance, what's
happening right now...

Not a fan.

Max, feedback from customers is
very important business tool.

Perhaps we'll pump the brakes
on sour waitress attitude.

There's only one tool
that can change my 'tude,

But I'm gonna need two
double-a batteries.

And a 20-minute break.

Welcome, everyone.

Thanks for coming to very important.

First official diner meeting.

This ain't right, man.
2:00 A.M. starts Earl time.

Earl, here's your brandy.

Okay, we're good now.

If I knew we were gonna have
staff meetings after work,

I would've taken job
at T.G.I. Friday instead.

Over there, they roll fast and loose.

Well, this is how I roll.

Yeah, short and slow.

No, I roll fast and furious.
Tokyo drift style.

Han, I'm starting to drift.
Can we get to the point?

Max and I still have to get home
and bake cupcakes for tomorrow.

We received so many excellent
comments from customers tonight.

Okay, first comment.

"dark-haired waitress..."
- hey!

"was very rude."

Hey!

Max, customers are giving.

Their honest opinions about diner.

We need to take it seriously.

Next comment.

"why does cashier wear earphones?

I thought he was a dj."

♪ go, earl, go, earl ♪

Holla!

Moving on.

"this meatloaf tastes stale and dry."

♪ yeah, oleg yeah, oleg ♪

It also says that cook
could wear deodorant.

And shirt that covers armpit.

- This is on card?
- Yes.

You are lying.

Yes.

Remind me never to be a spy with Han.

So this is how you tell
me what you think of me?

You hide behind outdated
method of feedback?

What, I should've posted
twitpic of my face like this?

Maybe I will send you a
twitpic of my meatloaf.

Can you twits pick
another time to do this?

I've gotta go home.

I have to go home too...

And cut the remaining sleeves
off of all my shirts.

And then go buy more shirts.

And cut the sleeves off those shirts.

You must wear sleeves.

Do not tell me what to do.

I was working here when you
were still a dumpling.

On your father's chopstick.

Now this is starting to
sound like earl time.

- Did it light?
- No.

Try another one. The gas is on.

Ah!

Why are we throwing fire at an oven?

Is this a poor people game?

Yeah, it's called light
the broken pilot light.

Without blowing our faces off!

This is ridiculous.
My heart is pounding.

I didn't know baking cupcakes
was an extreme sport.

It's like the deadliest batch.

See? A slight hint of gas in the air.

Makes everything funnier.

Now there's too much gas.

If we threw a math in there now,

I'd be out a nose or a pair
or a pair of eyebrows.

And I'm not living through that again.

Again?

When I was a little girl,

I was trying to make
a hungry man dinner.

And I lit the pilot light
too soon and whoosh!

No eyebrows.

Had to draw them on in magic marker.

Only mexican girls would talk to me.

Max, we have a cupcake business.

We have to tell the landlord
we need a new oven.

We can't ask the
landlord for a new oven.

Then he'll ask us stuff
like "who are you?

"why is your name not on the lease,

And where's the rent?"

Well, I'll buy us one.

Really?
You're gonna buy us a whole oven?

We're so poor I have a sock that
I refer to as my good sock.

I've been saving something
for an emergency,

Like a burst appendix or
a first date bikini wax.

I knew it!

You have a secret stash of your
father's missing billions.

We're rich!

Wait, it's other people's money.

Yeah, but I didn't steal it. We're rich!

They're my expensive rings.

So if these are your expensive rings,

What's all that other stuff you wear?

Cheaper copies.

You never wear the good
stuff out in public.

Got it, kind of like hiding
the banana republic.

And wearing the gap.

See how special?

They're all one-of-a-kind
from thomas aristotle thomas.

T-a-t. Tat.

What?

Tat rings.
You've never heard of tat rings?

Oh! Tat rings. No.

I guess it's the kind of thing.

That only people in the
know know, you know?

No.

Make all the jokes you want,

But I only have to sell one of these.

And I can get us a new oven.

Any ideas what kind we should get?

Uh, yeah, you're not the only
one with a secret stash.

It's the Bluestar.

It's the tat rings of ovens.

In purple!

That's right, I said purple.

It's the muscle car of ovens.
It's bad-ass!

It's so bad-ass when I do karaoke

I change the lyrics from
purple rain to purple range.

Great, we'll get this one.

Uh, we can't buy that.
It's too expensive.

This is just something
you fantasize about.

It's kitchen porn.

Fine.

Tomorrow we'll go to the
cash for gold store.

And get a regular oven and get cookin'.

I think the funny gas is gone.

Must be time. I'm going in.

Let me do it, my eyebrows
need to waxed anyway.

Hurry up! The gas is on!
Throw the match in!

- Did it light?
- No, but my foot is on fire.

I'll do it.

You're good.

I'm sorry, but how much
longer do we have to wait.

To get cash for our gold?

I told you before I'm on the phone.

Sit down, shut up, don't be rude.

I thought she'd be nicer
from her picture.

On the bus stop bench.

Yeah, and where are the dollar signs?

Let me see, which ring should I sell?

So much history in my lap.

I don't even wanna tell you
about the history in my lap.

My father got me this one in london.

I got this one in paris
to reward myself.

For not crying during the turbulence.

On the flight to paris.

My mom got me a fresca when
she hit me with her car once.

I got this one when I was 18.

It was my very first tat. Okay, stop!

This was a bad idea.
Let's get out of here.

I told you before. I'm on the phone!

Sit down, shut up, don't be rude.

I'm only sitting down because look.

She has her hand on a gun that's
strapped under the counter.

She is dying to plug us.

Max, what are you talking about?

Why is this a bad idea?

I don't want you sacrificing
your precious rings, frodo.

Because if the business
doesn't work out,

It'll be my fault you have nothing.

And call me selfish,

The only life I wanna ruin is my own.

Max, the business will go up and down.

That's natural.

But this ring is about more than
the day to day of the business.

It's about us...
And our future together.

Yo, did you just ask me to marry you?

You could do worse.

Now, ladies, gold. Now.

Come on. It's only one ring.

And when it comes to us, I'm
in this for the long haul.

Or until this lady shoots us.

- Hi, I'm here to...
- come on! Let's go.

Don't push me I'm out of nicorette.

Well, you're all business, aren't you?

I can respect that.

I'd like to exchange a tat ring.

I've never heard of a tat ring.

Thomas aristotle thomas?

World-famous designer?

Yeah, talk down to me.
That'll make the price better.

All right, I'll weight it.

What's that smell?

Is someone making soup in the back?

None of your business.

I will give you $275.

It's worth $2,500.

Where? In 2005?

You're just taking advantage of people.

Because the world economy is crashing.

It's called cash for gold, not
sympathy for flat chicks.

You know what? This is inappropriate.

All right, I'd like to see
your business license.

Maybe I'll make a call to
the chamber of commerce.

- Oh, you will, huh?
- Duck! Here comes the gun!

Maybe I'll make a call
to my boys in the back.

Sal! Richard!

Oh, hello. Let's get out of here.

Are you sure?
Because I'm kinda feeling richard.

Max, I was just in the ladies' room.

And I had a thought.

Why am I doing my lipstick in a
mirror that says "die carlos""

I know how to get the
full value of the ring.

We just have to take it to the
store where they sell it,

And return it.

Uh, and why didn't that
occur to you before?

'cause I don't have the receipt.

And I bought it three years ago...

From another store...
In another country.

The customer asked for crust
off of a turkey club.

Did they say that or is
this something you say.

That they said?

They said it.

But I say I see "screw the
bos"" sleeveless tee.

I'm sorry, someone call Ripley's.

There is a small mouse speaking.

And I bet for sure it comes
with stinky armpits.

Why don't you see for
yourself, ratatouille?

I've gotta go. Fight's starting.

You are stinky.

So stinky my mother in
Korea called me and said,

"What is that smell?"

I am surprised you're
upset by man smell.

Most women like you enjoy it.

Yo, Max, I got 20 bucks on Han.

He's scrappy.

Your english is terrible.

My english is less terrible
than your terrible english.

What? I couldn't understand
a word you said.

What? So sorry I couldn't
understand a word you said.

- Excuse me, regular-sized people.

I am on break until he apologizes.

I think the round's over.

I couldn't understand a word they said.

He needs to apologize. I'm the boss.

Don't let him get to you, Han.

Every woman knows size doesn't matter.

I like your shirt.

Reminds me of the side of the
van I lost my virginity in.

That little man disrespect me.

He insult my food, my
english, my "hyjane."

Is there anything I can
do to cheer you up?

A hug would help.

If I hug you, will you go back to work?

Yes.

- Two-second hug. I'm going in.

Aww.

How did you do that?
Your hands never left my back.

I am david blaine of zippers.

I was trying to cheer you up.

You did.

Wow, it's so surreal being back here.

I grew up here. It was like camp for me.

I learned who all the
best designers were,

How to color coordinate,
how to ride a bike.

They let you ride a bike here?

Bitch, I owned this piece.

If there's not an iguana in here,

This place is stupid.

Oh, my god.

They are such gorgeous tat rings.

- Thanks!
- Hate you! So jealous!

- Thanks!
- Bye!

Seeing you in your natural
habitat is truly disturbing.

Hi! Can I help you?

Hi! I'd like to return a ring
I got as a present here.

Tat rings are so amazing.

I can't believe you want to return it.

Well, this one's from a
guy I'm no longer with,

So it's painful to even look at.

I understand.

But I couldn't take it
back without a receipt.

The thing is he used to hit her.

Max! You did not!

Caroline, it's not your fault.

That's awful.

I understand why you
wouldn't want this ring.

I'm sure there's something I can do.

It's not our fault. I mean...Your fault.

Caroline Channing?

Jeffrey!

Surprised to see me working here?

Well, I got fired from that other store.

Whose name I will never mention again.

After last year's
cigarette butt incident.

I'm so sorry.

I had no idea those menthol
slim 100s were yours.

I just thought so many
butts on the ground.

Outside the store was gross,
so I said something.

Well, that one comment from
the great Caroline Channing.

About those butts fired my little butt.

You'd be happy to know
that I quite smoking.

After you got me fired.
Couldn't afford it.

I also couldn't afford
my gym membership.

Which is why my fired
little butt got massive,

Why no one wanted to date me, and
why I spent gay pride alone.

Fortunately, I wound up working here.

Yeah, it all worked out.
Your butt looks tight.

It's halfway there.

So I got the price on the ring.

You're buying a ring? A tat ring?

Actually, I'm returning.

Oh, can I see the receipt?

As manager of the jewelry department,

I couldn't possibly return
a ring that you bought.

At least three years
ago without a receipt.

You wouldn't want me to lose
my job again, would you?

I got this, donna.

And so sorry to hear about
your father being a criminal.

And you being penniless
and all that ugliness.

But it is kinda karma.

You are where you are now,
and I'm back on top.

Look, jeffrey, I know we just met,

But there's no way you're a top.

Now what are we gonna do?

We should hunt down that
super fake jealous lady.

Who hates you.

Maybe she'll buy one.

Max, that's brilliant.

If anybody's gonna buy a tat ring,

They're already in the store.

We can have a pop-up sale!

- A pop-up sale?

- You don't know what a pop-up sale is?

You didn't know what a pilot light was.

it's the new trend.

Mini stores pop up and sell stuff,

Then they're gone.

That's not a new trend.

Drug dealers have been
doing that for years.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

What are you doing, beautiful mind?

I'm mentally scanning the
layout of the store.

For security cameras.

I knew coming here and not
going to parks as a child.

Would pay off.

Okay, there's only one place
we could pull it off.

Where there are no cameras.

Where?

- Pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

That's right, ma'am!

I said pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

I don't do improv.

So did we sell the ring yet?

Those women weren't
our target customers.

We're looking for a very specific type.

Too much style and money to burn.

hold the elevator!

and I love new york!

Pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

I'll take you in two at a time.

Let me go check with my associate.

And I'll be right back
for adin and lublubah.

Such a good memory.

Hard to forget such beautiful names.

Ready?

We have a pooper in stall two.

Who shops and plops? I mean, really.

- Trust me, I smell the match.
Classic shop and plop cover-up.

Where are the two Kit Kats we
got from the vending machine?

I told you I was hungry.

Arabic women expect a gift
when they buy something.

Well, stall number two.

Will probably supply a little present.

- Hi, are you here for the pop-up sale?

- No, I just have to pee.
- Oh, geez.

Come on, don't waste my time!

One stall's open... in and out!
Running a business!

That woman pushed ahead of us.

Do not sell her my tat ring.

It's fun. You're here to pick up.

She's here to drop off.

Open the shop.

We're a good team.

You set 'em up, I knock 'em down.

- Why is?
- I don't know, it just is.

Are you here for the pop-up sale?

- A pop-sale in the bathroom?

So lame. So lame.

Caroline? Jen, Robin!

- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god.

- Excuse me.
When will pop-up sale start?

We have lunch reservations for
five at Four Seasons at 3:00.

Why are you asking me?

- You two are doing pop-up sale, no?

No.

I have nothing to do with this
pop-up sale in the bathroom.

- So lame.
- So lame.

So lame!

So lame.

Come to lunch with us.

Oh, I've already eaten.

Our treat.

We are not taking no for an answer.

They're not taking no for an answer.

Sell the ring.

Where is she going?
I thought you two were a team.

Apparently not.

So sorry.

I got caught up in a
hostage nicoise situation.

How'd it go?

Did you get full price for the ring?

Oh, do you know me?

Because I could've sworn
you didn't know me.

My new friends Adin and Lablueballs.

Thought it was weird that
you just bailed on me.

Max, I panicked in the moment.

I didn't want those
girls telling everyone

that Caroline Channing was in a
bathroom selling her jewelry.

I'm barely back on my feet
after the whole scandal.

I just couldn't bare it.

Here.

I didn't sell them because
I didn't buy the whole

"in it for the long haul"
thing from the beginning.

And I was right because
I'm always right.

About people in the long haul.

Max, I'm talking to you.

It's cool. We don't need to talk.

Max, about the rings, I'm sorry.

I don't know what else to say.

You don't need to say anything.

You already said a lot of words
about the future and us,

And then next thing I know,
you were "oh, my god!"

Off to lunch with your friends.

Max, I am in this for the long haul.

Isn't there anything I can
say to convince you of that?

Nope. And it's fine.

It's not you, it's me.

I'm the idiot who actually
believed for a minute.

That we had a future.

But it's okay.

We'll just keep getting by like
we are, for the short haul.

Cool?

Max.

Hey! Hey.

What's that smell? I'm making cupcakes.

- You lit the pilot light?
- Didn't have to. Look.

No way! The Bluestar in purple?

What the... how did it get...

How can... how could you afford that?

You sold your tat? Sold them all.

Spent it on the oven, next-day
delivery fee and installation.

That woman gave you a better price?

No, she pulled a gun on me.

So I went to every gold
store in Brooklyn,

leveraged their offers
against each other

until I got enough to buy the Bluestar.

You didn't have to do that.

After what I did, there
were no more words.

Only ovens.

And our future means more to
me than rings from my past.

I told you, I'm in this
for the long haul.

For the record, I hated
lunch with those girls.

I'd rather split a Kit Kat in
a bathroom with you any day.

I'm sorry I wasn't listening.

I was staring at my new
boyfriend over there.

I wanna make out with it!

Ooh. Ow! Hot!

There's not a ding!

There's a ding. My rings bought a ding.

You wanna hug me, don't you?

Yeah.

- But you're not gonna.
- Yes, I am.

If you unzip my shirt,
I'm gonna be pissed!

Impressed, but pissed.

Oleg, the people at Table Two

want to know
what's in the veggie burger.

No. They don't.

Eh. That's fine.

They wanted refills,
so I'm probably not

gonna go back there anyway.

Where's Max?

This plate has been
here so long,

the salmon is turning into
Salmonella.

She took a break
with the new dishwasher.

Max, I thought you slipped out
the back.

He did for a minute,
but I popped him back in.

This just in,
work is so much more fun

when you're sleeping
with a co-worker.

Max, that was good.

It was five Hail Marys good.

I think we made
these dishes dirtier.

Max, he's cute, but how can you
even stay hard with that accent?

"Come here, Max.
I wanna hump ya a wee bit".

What can I say,
I always had a thing

for the guy on the box
of Lucky Charms.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

Hey, everybody.

Look, I got me a Fitbit.

13, 14, 15...

Only 200,000 more steps
before I get a bit more fit

for my wedding.

That's impressive.

I couldn't even make it
through 12 steps.

Hey, Max.

How's my maid of honor?

Hey, Caroline.

How's my run-of-the-mill
wedding guest?

I'm doing great.
Did that sound convincing?

'Cause I've been practicing
it in the bathroom mirror

for an hour every morning.

I know, I've got to stop
sitting on the toilet

while you do that.

Max, let's talk
bridesmaid dresses.

I don't care,
I'll wear anything.

I wore a Greyhound Bus driver's
uniform to my prom.

I was coming
straight from work.

Well, I have decided to wear

Grandma Kuchenski's
wedding gown.

Yeah, all of the women
in my family wore it.

Everyone except
aunts Svetti and Letti,

'cause, well, they're attached
at the abdomen.

There she is.

The hot sauce
for my Huevos Mancheros.

Hey, Sophie, baby,
I got you what you want.

Oleg, no one wants Hepatitis.

It's official.

Our wedding's gonna be
in The Times.

Oleg, how are you gonna be
in The Times?

The Times tends to be picky

and you tend to be more
"picky your nose."

You know, my second wedding
made The Times.

'Cause my first wife showed up
and shot me in the leg.

[phone dings]

That's Vlanka, my sister.

She's my other bridesmaid.

Yeah, we're not that close,
but I feel bad for her

'cause she's one of those adults
with freckles.

Max, you're going to be
in The Times!

In The Times, wearing God knows
what Sophie will pick.

I mean, she has a drawer full
of diamond tiaras for the gym.

Hello, what are you two
talking about?

Deciding which tables to ignore?

We're talking about
Sophie's taste.

Oh, bitch, please.
Come on.

My morning fiber cookie
has better taste than Sophie.

Girls, Vlanka's out.

She has an attitude
and freckles.

Yeah. I mean,
that's too far.

So, Caroline,
congratulations!

You're my new bridesmaid!

Okay, I found a bridesmaid's
dress that I like.

But the only way we can afford
it is if I sell you

to that Armenian guy
on Craigslist.

No way.

I get sick of hummus
after four bites.

Max, we have to
take charge of this.

Because whatever bridesmaid's
dress Sophie picks

is like a Tyler Perry movie.

I don't have to see it
to know it's gonna be awful.

We'll find something
classy, and beautiful,

and just shove it
down her throat.

Who's shoving what down whom?

And if you don't
have a story, I do.

John, Max and I got roped
into being bridesmaids.

Stop.

You had me at rope.

You lost me
at bridesmaids.

I'll be at the hostess stand,
looking at dresses

and silently wishing
for an asteroid

to wipe us off the planet.

If wishes made things happen,
we'd been in the middle

of a zombie apocalypse
right now.

Hey, girls.

My dress just arrived
from Poland

and I'm bustin'
for you to see it.

See it while I eat
one of your $14 puddings.

Sophie, I've been looking
at color choices,

and how would you feel
about us in a nude?

Max could go nude but you don't
have the rack to pull it off.

Does anyone have a knife?

Max, why do you have
a switchblade

to work in a dessert bar?

My mother always told me
to carry protection.

Wait 'til you see
Grandma Kuchenski's dress.

They don't make them
like they used to.

You know, forced
gypsy labor is illegal now.

Here we go.

- Oh.
- Uh...

Sophie, was your grandma
the Crypt Keeper?

What's going on out here?

What's all that white powder
in the air?

I'm trying to run a restaurant,
not an 80's disco.

Oh, put a sock in it.

I'm buying one of your freaking
overpriced puddings.

I'd get mad but I'm mildly
attracted to you right now.

Just mildly?

I mean, now I'm getting mad.

Sorry.
Wedding drama.

Her dress just fell
completely to pieces...

like I'm assuming
I'll do in the near future.

Whatever you need anything
bridal,

go to Rosenfeld's in Brooklyn.

That's where I got my dress
when I was broke and straight.

So you weren't always
into women?

Of course I was.

Except those three years
in Scientology.

Well, it looks like
the three of us

are going to go
dress shopping now.

Yeah. And you know,
I got to go wash my hands

'cause they're covered
in old lady DNA.

Well, that's that.

Shopping with Sophie
is like when I worked

in a Thai massage parlor.

We are going down.

Not if we go before
Sophie

and hide every ugly bridesmaid's
dress that Sophie would like.

If she can't see them,
she can't make us wear them.

How did you come up
with that so fast?

It's the same plan
I used in 2010

when I was a bridesmaid
for Chelsea Clinton.

Bad dress and then her father
followed me into the coat room.

Oh, wow.

Look at this place.

It reminds me of that movie.

- Bridesmaids?
- No, Nightmare on Elm Street.

I don't know what you're worried
about, Caroline.

I think they're
all quite lovely.

Nash, please.

You're a poor person
from Ireland.

I'll ask your opinion when
I need to know where to go

to get free leg braces.

You were right, Max.

She can be
a real "B" sometimes.

I'm sorry, but I don't even know
why he's here.

Bonin' O'Brien here...

is gonna distract
the sales lady

while we hide the ugly dresses.

Hello, ladies.

Same plan.

Who's the lucky bride?

Or should I say,
who's the lucky cradle robber?

Don't mind me.

It's just my crazy sense
of humor.

Oh, the ladies here love it.

The call me "Crazy Carl."

[raspy voice]
"Did you hear
what Crazy Carl said?"

They just love it.

I'm Caroline.

This is Max
and he isn't the groom.

No, no, no.

He's single and gay.
Yes.

So gay, he got kicked out
of One Direction.

Why don't you two walk off
somewhere

and share poignant
coming-out stories.

Go.

- But Max--
- Oh, you heard the women, go.

Can do.

Ladies, look around,
we'll be back...

in about a month.

Tahiti anyone?

I'm just Crazy Carl.

The ladies love it.

Bridesmaid's dresses should be
called what they are.

Really expensive donations
to Goodwill.

Is this one bad?

No. That's a Vera Wang.

But this is a very wrong.

Hide it.

Ew. And it's evil twin.

Oh, I didn't know hazmat suits
came with feathers.

Oh my God.

This the worst thing
I've ever seen.

And I've seen a prostitute
change her tampon

on the sidewalk.

Who are you calling
a prostitute?

This, we've got to hide.

I can't get this dress off.

Just tell it you work at Google

and you're thinking
of settling down.

Lift it up. Lift it up.
Dump it back there.

Stop!

You put
Butterscotch Betty down.

Oh, we were just looking
for a price tag.

I know what's going on here.

You're hiding the good dresses

to make sure no one else
can get them

at our annual half-off
sale tomorrow.

Yeah, that's what we're doing.

We're hiding the good dresses.

In fact, I just caught another
Sneaky Sue.

Oh, I'm Sophie.

Oh, wow, wow, wow.

Oh, look at the color.

That's not color.
That's radiation.

That dress is a one of a kind.

Meaning there's only one?

No, we have two.

And I have two bridesmaids!

I love it when life works out
perfect like this.

[indistinct chatter]

(Public address announcement)
Ladies, our half off sale will
begin in a minute.

Look at this place.

There are more desperate women
crammed in here

than the splash zone
at a Kenny Chesney concert.

I know. It's like Black Friday
at Walmart

And like Black Friday, hopefully
someone will trample me.

Cause thanks to these dresses,
my life is over.

Max, did you hear me?

My life is over.

You said that
when the Chinese food place

forgot the duck sauce.

Well, I'm sorry, but I had
a whole other scenario planned

for my return to The Times.

"Entrepreneur rises
from the ashes."

Now, I'm just going to be
in The Times,

looking like a stupid ash.

Shoot, girl,
just push on through.

I'm pushing, girl.
I am pushing.

(both)
Excuse us.

Excuse us.

Excuse us.

Just go, girl.

I don't want anybody else
to get those

two yellow dresses.

Max, did you hear that?

Someone has worst taste
than Sophie.

Now we just have to
hang back here

and let them get
to those dresses first.

Yay!
My life is good again.

Max, Caroline, up here.

What was that, like, a second?

I saved you a space upfront.

Come on.

Well, it's over.

As soon as they cut
that ribbon,

Sophie's going to
Marshawn Lynch everyone who

gets in the way
of us and those dresses.

There's only one way out
of this.

And you called it earlier.

You have to let them
trample you.

I'm serious.

I'm not about to be trampled
on purpose.

See if you still feel that way

after I say
these next few words:

"Pictured from left,
Caroline Channing."

Try to fend off any heels
you see heading for my eyes.

Attention, ladies.

As you see,
I have the big scissors,

which can only
mean it's time...

to trim some nose hairs!

[laughter]

That Carl is crazy.

The annual bridal sale...

- is now...
- Max, hold my hand.

Open!

[all shouting]

Ladies, ladies,
one at a time.

Oh!

Well, I may be limping down
the aisle,

but at least I won't be limping
in something Swiffer might sell

to dust off ceiling fans.

[woman screaming]

Oh, my God, girl!
here she comes!

Here she comes.

My girl, Rhonda,
had that dress first.

Oh, your girl
is gonna have to

pry it out of my cold,
dead hands.

Hey, Max, Caroline!

Try it on!

Follow me
to the changing room.

(Caroline)
I'm never coming out
in this dress, I'm scared.

(Max)
So on the count of one, two...

Maybe it's not that bad.

(both)
It's bad.

Okay.
So you're telling me,

Versace got murdered,

but no one's taken out
whoever made these?

I know.

I feel like Tweety Bird
is gonna sue us

for copyright infringement.

I feel like we should have giant
toilet paper rolls under here.

Well, maybe
we'll like these better

when we're out of
this bright light.

Max, we are the bright light.

Ladies, you forgot
the matching hats.

There's more?

Oh, if anyone finds a Xanax,
it's mine.

It was knocked out of my hand
by two women duking it out

over a chintz mermaid dress.

Oh, now it looks good.

There's Xanax on the loose
and I'm just standing here?

At least if I was high, I'd have
an excuse to be wearing this.

Here pilly, pilly.

Here pilly, pilly, pilly.

Girl, for real,
you look like straight up crap

in that dress.

For real.

You white girls can't pull
that color off.

That's a waste of poppin'
lemon yellow.

I know.

I am way too white
for this.

She's also too white to say
"turnt up" all the time,

but that hasn't stopped her.

This dress was not my choice.

I hate everything about it.

This is a disaster.

This is "Dressageddon."

Yeah, but in a good way.

You two don't want
to wear the dresses.

You don't have to.

But I thought you wanted us
to match

the balloons
and the ducks.

Max, she said we don't have to
wear the dress.

Don't question her!

That's like questioning
a prison guard

when he says
you're free to go.

Sophie, are you sure
you don't care?

Oh, yeah.
Sure.

Yeah, they're all yours,
Destiny's Child.

This is ten pounds
of ugly junk.

Reminds me of this bartender,
Pete, I used to date.

Come to think of it,
that made me gag, too.

Okay. Done.

[woman crying]

Listen, crying
in a women's dressing room?

Whoever it is, girl,
big butts are in.

[crying continues]

That's Sophie's cry.

I know, 'cause
I hear it through the vent

when she watches Nashville.

Sophie?

(Sophie)
No.

Are you okay?

(Sophie)
It's not me,
but I'm okay.

[sobbing continues]

Sophie, why are
you crying?

When I heard what you said
about the dresses...

It's just--

It's almost, kind of like,

you think I have bad taste
or something.

No.

Caroline thinks
you have great taste.

She does?

Well, then she should say so.

Now.

Well, Sophie, I think you have
your own unique style.

And I think...

that I didn't hear
the words "great" or "taste."

Sophie, what do you even care
what I think?

Just say it!

Sophie, I think
you have great taste.

You do?

[Sophie laughs]

Then, what are we doing
sitting here?

Let's go and get those
dresses back!

Come on.
Help me!

Those other girls
already took them.

What?

Well, at least we don't have to
wear those ugly,

yellow bridesmaid dresses
at the wedding.

Yup.
Now, you only have to wear

ugly, yellow dresses here,
every night.

This is the best thing
that's happened to me

since I realized that weird mole
on my arm was just a Grape-Nut

and not cancer.

Girls, great news.

You stuffed Han
in the microwave

and you're ready
to hit power?

Come on. We've tried.

You know he doesn't fit.

The one thing he's too big for.

No, I got Ilia Jorbich to be
our wedding photographer.

He's the best photographer
at The Warsaw Times.

Well, he's the only one
who still has both arms.

Wait, it's the Warsaw Times?

All this time,
I've been thinking

it was The New York Times.

New York Times?

This is much more exclusive.

You can only get it
in two places.

Poland and the deli in
New Jersey that sells missiles.

This is amazing.

My comeback in
The New York Times

has been preserved.

Max, I'm gonna go ahead
and smile.

My life is good again.

Don't smile yet,
'cause Sophie told me

that because you said
she had such good taste,

she's designing our dresses
herself.

What was that,
like a second?

Yup. You just went
from the best of times

to The Warsaw Times.

Wow! Bummer, dude.

You have a time machine?

And somehow, it got programmed
to this crap diner?

I must admit, I am
quite taken with steampunk.

Oh, steampunk, right.
I remember that trend.

It happened for,
like, ten seconds

back in 2000
and-are-you-kidding-me?

Dude, seriously,
you're sitting

in a public place
tap-tap-tapping

on an oldie typewriter?

What are you?

In the league of extraordinarily
pretentious gentlemen?

Aren't you being
a little aggressive?

Yup.

That's how people are
here in the present

where we live.

But don't get me wrong.

I'd like to go
back in time, too.

Maybe stop 9/11 or that creep
who had sex on my shoe,

but I can't.

Present?
Where's that uniform from?

Like, 1998?

Oh, stop,
or I'm going to have

to shoot you
with a Smith & Wesson

I'm currently packing
in my bloomers.

I'll go get thee a menu,
my good man.

Advertise your product or brand here

attention, everyone.

Max and I have a little
late-night treat for you.

Don't say it
all excited like that.

Now when it's not drugs,
Earl's going to be pissed.

You are invited
to a very important taste-test

of Max's homemade cupcakes.

Okay,
but I will have only one.

When I get a tummy,
single ladies call me Buddha

and rub me for luck.

I gotta watch out, too.

Last time I had Max's
chocolate espresso cupcake

before going home,

I was awake
till 5:00 A.M.,

hand washing all my thongs.

Thongs?
Earl, you devil.

That's right, just because
there's snow on the roof

doesn't mean there's
not swing in the sling.

Oh, Caroline, darling.
Can you go back over there?

I forgot my racing form.

Oh, horse racing?
It reminds me of Chestnut.

Max... Chestnut.

What's with the sad face?

Your horse is living it up
at a fancy stable nearby.

Not gone to the great stud farm
in the sky.

Did someone say
"stud farm"?

My fee is $10 a quart or $15
if you want a boy.

Wow.

You bounced back from your
Sophie breakup pretty quick.

It was not
a real breakup.

I will have her
very soon again.

Right now, I lay low
and wait in bushes

like determined jungle cat.

Or a rapist.

Racing forms,
here you go.

Earl,
maybe some time

you will take me out
to the track with you.

I used to ride horses
all the time in Korea.

The mechanical ones
for a quarter

in front of
supermarkets?

Actually, Max,
I'm a very good rider.

In fact, I was training
to be a jockey

but was too short.

Too short
to be a jockey?

That's a hard hit,
my man.

Han, I had no idea
you loved horses, too.

Why didn't you
ever say anything?

Well, why didn't you ever ask
about any of my interests?

I'll tell you why.

Because all you ever talk about
is "our cupcake business,"

our cupcake business."

Doesn't your cd
have other tracks?

Anyway,
our cupcake business

has a very important
meeting tomorrow

with Paul Platt,
the party planner.

I know
a party planner, too.

He sells J .Lo.
and Salma Hayek Pinatas

off back of truck
for Cinco de Mayo.

Awesome.
Put me down for a Hayek.

More storage space
for candy.

Well, our party planner
is the it guy in Manhattan.

And tomorrow,
Max and I are doing

a tasting for him
at his office.

How can someone be too short
to be a jockey?

Isn't that
the whole point?

Are you all right, Max?

I got here
as fast as I could.

Caroline texted me
to hurry over

because you didn't know
you were pregnant,

and you were giving
birth over toilet.

So I grabbed
my plunger and ran!

That is insane.
I never texted that.

No, I did,
when I stole your phone.

I needed a reason
to get Sophie over here.

I can't believe
she believed it.

Oh, come on, Max.
Giving birth over toilet?

That is very you.

Now that you are here,
Sophie, sit.

I want to tell you
something important.

Well, you can forget that.

There's no way
I'm going to stay.

A cupcake party?

Oh, look, and this one
even has a pretzel in it.

Yup, that's
our "salty n' spice"

for our more
adventurous customers.

Also for
the uptight white people,

we have
the very, very vanilla

which is... big surprise...
My favorite.

And this is our beer-batter
maple bacon

spring break cupcake.

That's for stoners,
and big surprise, my favorite.

Well, I have
some big news

I want to share with you
all as well.

Sophie, that classy lady
right over there...

Mm, I like this one.

She recently
broke it off with me

because she wanted
to be with a man

who had a dream
and a drive.

So I have bought
a drive...

A Lincoln town car.

Yes, I have a new car service
and slogan:

"Lie back and I will ride you
till you tell me to stop."

So, oleg, you now have
a town car business?

And Sophie,
you rent town cars all the time.

Oh, oh, please.

I mean, I love pizza, too,
but that doesn't mean

I have to marry papa John.

I was just thinking,
you might want to come out back

and take a look at the light-up
makeup mirror on visors.

Light-up makeup mirror?

Oh, I might be interested.

But not just you and I.

Han will come as well.

Finally! Han is getting
invited to something.

Other than LinkedIn.

- So much for the taste test.
- It's fine.

I know what's best
for our cupcake business.

I do say that a lot,

but I think
it's kind of charming.

I'll go get our coats.

Mm, mm, mm.
Look at you.

I must say, I'm impressed
with how far you've come.

Well, you burn
a few thousand cupcakes,

you're bound
to get better.

Not just the cupcakes, Max.

Look how far you've come.

When I think of that girl
who came in here

just looking to get by...

Hey, and check you out now.

Big, fancy meeting in Manhattan.
Lordy lord!

- It's only a meeting, Earl.
- Maybe.

But if you were
one of these horses,

I'd put all
of my money on you, Max.

Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

Poor kid.

If I had that job,
I'd be asking someone

to please hold a gun
to my head.

He's probably excited
to be working for Paul Platt.

Look at
all these magazines

calling him
the next Martha Stewart.

Someday, we'll have
articles about us.

You know,
pictures of you and me

standing outside
our country home.

Hold on.

We're rich and still
living together?

Okay, she's leaving.
This is us.

About time.

Been sitting here so long
my ass is asleep,

which kind of goes against
my theory that it won't quit.

Hi, Paul's going to be
a little longer.

It's fine.
It's just...

Paul Platt parties,
please hold.

- Paul Platt parties...
- How much longer...

- Please hold.
- Me or them?

I got the ass
pins and needles.

- Max.
- What? We're on hold.

Have a seat.
Five more minutes.

Paul Platt parties.

The word "party"
at a party planner's?

Little obvious.

Like me having art that says
"will die alone."

Wait.

I think this is Johnny's art.
No way.

"No way" is right.
Johnny's a nobody.

Paul Platt wouldn't have
a framed "Johnny" in his office.

Look, signed "j. Peg."
That's his tag.

Yo, what's the deal
with this art?

It's a street artist.

Everyone's getting
really into him now.

Oh, yeah?

He was trying to get into me
a few months ago.

It was more emotional
than that.

He cheated on
his girlfriend with her

and then blew her off.

It was really hard
for us.

And you thought
me slapping my ass

in front of him
was inappropriate?

- Wow, Johnny made it.
- Well, good for him.

He's making it,
we're making it...

We're making it?

I magic-markered
over the scuffs on my boot,

and we can't
even get past

the poor man's John Cusack
over there.

Max, we are making it.

We've come a long way.

We haven't used
Starbucks napkins

for toilet paper
in months.

And now,
look where we are.

We've got a meeting
with Paul Platt.

Say it:
"We're making it."

I'm serious.
Say it, Max.

We are making it.

Okay, we're making it.

- Caroline channing.
- This is us!

- Ahh.
- What, five more minutes?

Monday at 4:00.
Something came up.

Oh, okay.
Well, Monday at 4:00.

There's no Monday at 4:00.

He said Monday at 4:00.
Monday at 4:00, right?

Absolutely.
Monday at 4:00.

There is no Monday at 4:00.

I'm confused.
Is there a Monday at 4:00?

In the books, Monday at 4:00.
Paul can't wait.

There is
no Monday at 4:00.

I don't understand.
Are we coming in Monday at 4:00?

Absolutely.
Paul's a big fan.

Don't come in on Monday.

Can you please tell me
what's going on?

See, it's this news
about your father being moved

to a cushy white collar
prison this week.

Paul can't have anything to do
with someone named channing,

'cause everyone
in New York is pissed.

Look at all that.
It never stops.

How much more of this
do I have to take?

So we'll see you
on Monday!

Don't come.

I woke my ass up
for this?

Mmm.
This was delicious, Max.

Here's a $20.
Keep the change.

What are you doing,
Sophie?

You don't pay
for the cupcakes.

No, take it
for your business.

Ever since your big
party planner meeting went bust,

I was worried
that you two girls

might form
a joint suicide pact.

Nah, we're
not that organized.

So how's Caroline today?

She's handling it all
better than I thought.

She's with her father's
lawyer right now,

trying to figure out
the best time for her

to go out to the prison
to see him before he's moved.

Oh, that is my new phone.

You know there's a phone
stuck to that gay furby, right?

Yes, this is from my
favorite store on 14th street,

rhinestoned.

Oh, it's just a text
from my driver.

He's waiting out front.

Why don't you
just invite oleg inside?

I'm not sure yet
he deserves to come inside.

Well, from what I heard,
he's already come inside.

Oh, Max, I love it
when you're dirty!

Hey, how'd it go?

Well, according
to my father's lawyer,

the prison is surrounded
by so much press

that daddy doesn't want me
to come out there

and be exploited
all over again.

Why is he still
the only news story out there?

Well, the good news is,

your hair
is especially shiny today.

It is?
Thanks, Sophie.

So try not
to kill yourself.

Well, if I didn't kill myself
reading these in the car,

I won't.
Hate mail.

It was being held
at my old P.O. box.

My father's lawyer
picked it up for me.

Why didn't he just punch you
in the face and call it a day?

I know, it's like the end of
miracle on 34th street,

only everyone's
calling me a bitch.

Oh, come on, not everyone
is calling you a bitch.

"Dear bitch,
I hate you."

"If I ever see you
on the street, I will..."

Shake your hand
and wish you well,

as you have been through
so very much.

That is not
what that says.

It might be.

It's hard to read
his actual words,

as they are
written in blood.

Oh, look how fancy.
This is not hate mail.

No, this is invitation to
metropolitan museum annual gala.

It is?

This is my favorite social event
in all of New York.

I've gone every year
since I was 18.

It's a fashion ball
at the museum of art...

Yeah, I know
what it is.

- I catered it last year.
- Max, how weird.

We were probably
right in the very same room.

Then there's a good chance
I spit in your drink.

Not really, unless you were
acting all prissy and demanding.

There's a good chance
you spit in my drink.

Well, see?
This is happy news.

No, as much as I want to,
I can't go.

Everybody hates me.

And much worse,
I have nothing to wear,

and if you're gonna be hated,
you better look damn good.

I give up. That invitation
finally broke me.

Why are you
pulling down your bed?

Because I don't have
a door to slam.

Hell, I don't even
have a door!

Everything's
been taken away, Max...

My fortune,
my business career,

my social life,
my sweet, sweet horse.

Okay, take a nap.
You're upset.

You have
a good reason to be.

A good reason?

I say she has
200, 300 good reasons.

I mean, read these.

These are like
letters to the devil.

I'm just going to get in there
and never get out.

Close it up, Max.
Put me in the wall.

No, it's really hard to
close it when you're in there.

I've tried.

Look, I know
it's not even remotely close

to what you had before,

but we do have
our cupcake business

and our purple stove,
and we do have $922.

And we're gonna make it.

Wall me.

Come on, all you need
is a big, glamorous party.

I mean, look at
all the celebrities

that are on the list:
Martha Stewart,

Justin Timberlake...

Ooh, Hugh Jackman!

Oh, I like to call him
"huge" Jackman,

because I bet
he has a big penis.

Wall me.

Thank you, sir.

Welcome home, buddy.

As you can see,
we haven't put the pool in yet.

We'll get to it.

Tree, grill, shovel...
Usual cast of characters.

Now, I am going
to take you in to her,

but I should warn you.

She hasn't been
out of bed for two days,

and that means no tooth brushing
and it's bad up in there.

I'm pretty sure horses
have a keen sense of smell,

so just be prepared.

I missed you, too.

Max, I'm trying to sleep.
Take your boots off.

Caroline,
I have something for you.

Go away.
I'm dead.

Jeez, and you said
my breath was bad.

You have a visitor,
someone you love.

Chestnut!
Chestnut, hi, baby, hi.

How did he get here?

I went to peach
and told her

it was a matter
of life and death

and we had
to have him back.

And what,
she just gave him back to you?

Well, I did have to agree
to come back and babysit

one day a week
for the rest of my life,

but hell, Chestnut's home.

Max, thank you so much.
You brought me back to life.

Oh, my God,
don't exhale on me.

Your breath is like you
went down on a brussels sprout.

Tip your head that way.

Chestnut, Chestnut.

Don't breathe
on him either!

His whole head is a nose.
He can't handle that.

Chestnut's home.

Hey, Earl.
Long time, no see.

Well, well, well,
Johnny.

If it isn't
the famous street artist.

Well, I'm hardly famous.

You got that right.

My remark was
laced with sarcasm.

Can you tell Max
I'm here?

That depends.
Are you still a two-timing bum?

That's his name,
don't wear it out.

Hiya, slugger.

Can you do me a favor
and call Earl off?

I may be on day six
of my p90x,

but I'm in no shape to take on
a heavyweight like him.

It's okay, Earl, we're cool.

Well, I am.
He's just riding my fumes.

So, uh,
where's your section?

- Counter.
- Hm, same ol', same ol'.

Johnny's in the diner.

Why is he here?
It can't be to eat.

He's "made it."
He eats "made it food" now.

Well, obviously,
he's here to see you.

Or else he won the award for
biggest lying jerk in New York,

and this is the first stop
on his press tour.

Well, I don't know
why he's here,

but you better
come with me.

He looks really good,
so I'm not listening

to a thing coming out of
his pretty mouth.

Well, I was gonna
ask what the specials were,

but you know what?
Can I actually just get

one of Max's
homemade cupcakes?

- Okay, which flavor?
- Surprise me.

Kind of like how you surprised
her with your girlfriend?

Okay, I'm starting
to get a vibe here,

and that's why I came in,
because I feel bad,

the way things
went down between us,

and I came to say good-bye
because I'm moving.

Oh, moving.
To where?

- Manhattan.
- Manhattan?

That hardly calls
for a good-bye speech.

It's over there.

Yeah, I know,
but it's a big change for me,

and we're not going
to be rolling

in the same circles
anymore,

and I'm getting married...
Over there.

Well, at least you and
your girlfriend worked it out.

Actually, we broke up.

This is someone
I met a couple months ago.

I was only
watching his lips,

but did they just say
what I think they said?

Well, there's your cupcake.
That'll be $5.

The price has gone up.
Yeah, we're successful now.

In fact, we may be working
with Martha Stewart.

Caroline knows her
from, you know, before.

We're gonna talk it over
with her

at the met gala ball
that Caroline got invited to.

Martha's on the committee.
Caroline goes every year.

Not a big deal.

My first time.
Not a big deal either.

In fact, none of it's
a big deal,

just two girls
who are making it

but who choose to stay
in Brooklyn 'cause we're cool.

That's awesome, Max.
That's awesome.

It's just funny,
because whenever I think of you,

I think of you in this diner
in that uniform.

In a good way.

You want money now?

Yeah.
It's business.

It's not like we had
a relationship or anything.

In fact,
you can pay Caroline.

She's the money.
I'm the artist.

You know, I'm doing pretty
well as an artist myself.

I've been selling
a lot of my stuff.

Really?
We hadn't heard.

And there's your cupcake.

In case you didn't notice,
that container's to go.

Got it.

He's gone.
I got rid of him.

Max?

What are you doing?

Punching cheesecakes.

It's my version
of going to bed for two days.

Are you more upset
about the marriage thing

or the uniform thing?

Oh, this isn't about Johnny.
I'm mad at the cheesecakes.

They were supposed
to have cherries on top,

and I wanted cherries!

Why not me?

Okay, maybe it's half
no cherries, half Johnny.

Nothing ever
does work out for us.

And then I hear myself saying
all that ridiculous stuff

about us talking
to Martha Stewart at the gala.

I mean, what was that?
It's insane.

Is it?

Wait, seriously, is it?

Or is it just insane enough
to be genius?

Max, we have the invitation.
She'll be there.

Why are we wasting our time
with Paul Platt

when we can
meet the real thing?

We can take Martha
our best cupcake,

explain our situation,

and maybe...
Maybe she'll talk to us.

I mean, she was a girl
with a dream once, too,

and she certainly
understands hard times.

You are talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart.

I am talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart!

I even have my gorgeous Judith
leiber jeweled cupcake purse

to smuggle the cupcake in.
It's perfect.

I knew there was a reason
I took that from the townhouse.

Great, you have a cupcake
and a cupcake purse.

What else are we gonna
wear to the ball, cinderella?

Are the rats in the alley gonna
whip us up some ball gowns?

I mean, it's not exactly
like we have a fairy godmother.

Hey, look, girls!

I got myself a crown
and a wand at rhinestoned.

I'll have the soup
in my booth.

Well, this is as close
to a fairytale

as you and I are ever gonna get,
so what the hell?

Max, does that mean
we're gonna find

a way to go to the ball?

Oh, yeah.
Get your cupcake on,

'cause we're gonna
get balled.

Sophie, this is
so generous of you

to offer to buy us dresses
for the gala,

but as much as my shoes
love being back

- in their place of birth...
- Oh, your shoes were born here?

Mine were born in China,
but I adopted them at payless.

Maybe we should
find something cheaper,

at one of
those consignment stores.

"Consignment stores"?

Come on,
what are we, gypsies?

This is big fancy ball.
We need ball gowns.

Never really been
a fan of balls.

In fact, always thought
they got in the way,

but here we are.

Well, we do have
to look amazing

if we're approaching
Martha Stewart with a cupcake,

so we'll find
a way to pay you back

and start by doing some
cleaning jobs for you for free.

No! Every year
I give money to charity,

and I like
you two girls

way more than the babies
with the broken smiles.

So don't worry.
I got plenty of cash.

Aww, a roll of hundreds.

Reminds me of my Christmas
stocking stuffers.

Yeah, this is fun day.

I'm like Richard Gere
and you're my two hookers.

Well, when you put it
like that,

I'm a little
more comfortable.

Good afternoon.
How can I help you?

Hi, how are you?
We don't have a lot of time.

We have to be
at work by 6:00.

Can you show us your best
formal spring couture?

Perhaps you ladies
might be more comfortable

down in ready-to-wear.

As I said,
we're in a bit of a rush.

We might move a little quicker
if you dropped the attitude

and picked up
some dresses.

So that's three of our
delicious homemade cupcakes.

Nope, can't.
You touched them.

Sorry, flu season, no health care.

You realized I replaced that
Purell with K.Y., right?

Max, please say you're kidding.

Of course, I'm kidding.

I can't afford lube.
I just use my tears.

Max, seriously, don't mess
with my hand sanitizer.

I've already caught poverty this year

and I refuse to catch the flu.

I just have to keep cleaning my
hands and not touch anyone.

Caroline, I have check from table ten.

Okay, just place it right there.

That's a big tip, wow--

You know, in Indonesia,
you'd be married now.

I'm gonna get sick, I know it.

You're fine.

Fine? Han just unloaded into my mouth.

Congratulations, you both
finally got some action.

I can't afford to
get sick and miss work.

I need to get some antibiotics.

You are poor now.

Poor people don't just run out
and buy antibiotics.

We man up, grow a pair,
stare germs in the face.

Like this French fry from that
guy who couldn't stop coughing.

Max, no, no--oh!

Mmm.

Booyah!

And I haven't ever been sick
or to a clinic.

And, no, planned parenthood
doesn't count.

Well, well, well, she weebles
and she wobbles,

but she don't fall down.

Oh, Earl, you're so naughty and nice.

And I'll be checking you out twice.

Hey, Sophie, sit anywhere you like.

Oh, uh, let's see.

Where is lighting that will make
me look most attractive?

I wonder if he's here yet.

Well unless you've been cruising

singles who don't leave enough
singles, I'd say no.

You know, Max, if my date
turned out to be big bust--

what, bigger than ours?

Then you come over and say that

something suddenly came up and
that I have to go, okay?

Oh, my gosh, this must be him.

You must be Sophie Kuchenski.

I'm Serguisz Bilowski.

Oh.

Wow, I love your dress, I love that!

Something came up and you have to go.

No, no this is perfect.

Would you like to sit down?

Just let me run to
the little boys rooms first.

- Okay?
- Okay.

Who is that?

That's Sophie's new boyfriend.

I see, and where's his boyfriend?

Hello.

Nice to see you again.

I'm wearing my velour
especially for you.

And right now, it's the only
thing soft about me.

Please go away before my date
comes back from the men's room.

You have brought other man in here?

Yes, I met him on Polish dating site.

On polemeetpole.com

you didn't have to go online.
You could meet my pole any time.

No, this will never happen.

You're not my type.

Well, what is your type?

Wow, they have those automatic
hand dryers that blow you.

I love being blown like that.

Those look like two giant
orange traffic cones.

Are you trying to tell me
not to park there?

This is a lady.

Show her some respect.

Sophie has new man in her life.

I am so mad I cannot see straight.

Well, I'm looking right at him
and I don't see straight either.

Max, I think I'm running a slight fever.

Feel my forehead.

Look, you should have learned
by now-- I don't feel anything.

Caroline, I've written down
address of drug store

in South Williamsburg that
has a doctor on site.

Here, I will pay for it.

Unless it is cancer.

Then I'm out.

And, Max, here is check for table seven.

Booyah!

How long is it gonna
take to see a doctor?

I'm definitely getting
something-- I'm pre-sick.

I'm stage one pre-sick.

I need penicillin.

I told you before, you have to man up

and not give in to this sick stuff.

I'm not like you.

I have actual things I feel.

Menachem Goldman.

Menachem Goldman.

This must be the orthodox
Jewish neighborhood.

Either that or we're in ZZ Top-ville.

Max, have some respect.

Hey, I got nothing but respect.

They basically invented southern rock.

I love the Jewish people.

Whenever I felt sick before,
I'd just pop over

to the townhouse next door
and visit Dr. Klein.

So your love was contingent on pills?

We're not that different.

Actually, the Kleins
and I were very close.

I was invited to many
a Passover in their home.

In fact, they called me
their honorary Jew.

Rivka Shemshelewitz.

Rivka Shemshelewitz.

Well, you're no Rivka Shemshelewitz.

Mrs. Klein always said
I had a Bissel Jew.

You had a Jewish vacuum cleaner?

No.
Bissel.

It's a Yiddish word.
It means little.

And this one time I had a bissel flu

and she brought me
chicken soup every day.

So why don't you just
give Dr. Klein a call?

I did three times and no return.

I guess he doesn't want anything
to do with me anymore

because of my father's
financial scandal.

All those years I thought
we were family.

Guess not.

I don't know, ignoring your

needs and pretending you don't exist?

Sounds like family to me.

Caroline Channing, Caroline Channing.

Finally.

Let me do the talking.

I learned a lot of
Hebrew from Mrs. Klein.

These are my people.

Hello, shalom.

Very good, you wanna squeeze
in a couple more before sundown?

Wow, you're as bad
as me trying to be Irish

at the blarney rose for a free beer.

Yar, can I get me a cerveza?

What can I get you ladies,

besides skirts that
are more appropriate?

Sorry, I didn't know it
was an orthodox neighborhood.

You know what, we could just tie
our coats around our waists.

Max?

Oh, and look at the breasts on this one.

Coat on or off?
Make up your mind.

No, Bubala, I'm just saying,
with those big breasts

and that gorgeous hair it's
like looking in a mirror.

It's been a few years, but trust
me, under this wig and smock,

spitting image of you.

Here you go, Esther Rachael.

How else do you think I landed

a handsome doctor like my Anshell?

Oh, doctor?

Doctor?
Doctor, if you could--

oh, oh, what is that
Hebrew word for wait?

You might wanna start
peppering in some English.

Now, Chava?

Now you're telling me
you're too sick to bake.

I need 80 cupcakes.

The bar mitzvah is tomorrow.

You're dead to me!
See you next week.

- We could help.
- We can?

Yeah, give me the card.

Hi, I'm Max and my friend and I
here have a cupcake business

and we'd be happy to
bake as many cupcakes

as you need for the bar mitzvah.

I mean, you need cake, we make cake.

It's bashert.

Look, enough with the "it's a
small Hebrew world after all."

How does 250 sound?

No way, 275.

I have to bake all morning.

It's like looking in a mirror.

They're kosher, right?

Are they kosher? Look at me.

Like looking in a mirror.

Good, I'll call you with the address.

Esther Rachael, if I could
talk to you husband

about getting some antibiotics--

sorry, sundown.

Okay, I've got the kosher
cookbook, salt, flour, sugar,

new mixing bowls, and I
stopped at the goodwill

and got us two appropriately

sad schmatas to wear for tomorrow.

Let's start.

Start?
I'm already half done.

How could you be half done?

You didn't have any kosher ingredients.

Oh, they'll never know, we'll just

tell them they're kosher.

Oh, my God, we can't do that.

Oh, my God, we just did.

They have to be kosher.

Do you want God to smite us?

What's he gonna do?

Take away all my good luck
and your fortune?

You think all those things
labeled low fat are low fat?

It is just a sales gimmick.

I had a low cal ice cream bar once

that popped my top Jean button.

Kosher isn't a sales gimmick.

It's thousands of years of tradition.

We have to respect that.

I don't respect anyone's tradition.

That's kind of my tradition.

Well maybe that's because

you didn't grow up around a family.

Hey, I grew up with a lot of families.

The Manson family, the Jackson
family, the Menendezes.

Wait, is that Menendezes or Menen-di?

Either way, they were like
brothers to me.

Max, we are doing these
straight up kosher.

Fine.

But return those new bowls,
I don't need them.

I can just dump the bacon bits
out of this old one.

Max, please, let's just
start the cupcakes over,

drop them off, get me some antibiotics,

come home, and put me to bed.

All right, I'll make them kosher.

I mean, it's the least
you could do after you

lied to that woman and let her
think you were one of them.

Hey, I don't know who my father is.

I could be half Jewish.

Although it's more likely
I'm half bartender

who demanded my mom figure out
a way to pay her tab.

- Hey!
- Hello.

Serguisz and I are on
way up to my apartment.

He's making me brunch.

Cornish hens splashed
with my special sauce.

I love special sauce, I love that!

Yeah, and I stopped by
because I was hoping you girls

might have some spare
cupcakes for dessert.

Only about 40 of them.

Oh, good!

I'll go up and get started.

Sophie, can I have you keys?

- Oh, yeah.
- Cute place.

Ah, I have keychain just like this.

We are birds of a feather.

I love that!

See, girls.

This is what I like about
my new boyfriend.

He loves so many things.

And vagina ain't one of them.

Max!

We don't know that.

Sexuality is more fluid these days.

It's okay.
He's big, big gay.

So... You know he's gay?

Oh, know it?

I prefer it.

Yeah, my ex-husband
was large male bully.

Yeah, all rough sex
and stains in shorts.

Now all I want is a man who will
spoon me and stay soft.

But what about sex?

Oh, no one does me better than me.

That's the last of them.

Look at us.

I think we look very nice.

Really?

I think we look like the Olson twins.

Well hello, girls.

You look very lovely.

Mazel tov to the family.

What a mitzvah to be part of this day.

How bashert.

Oh, we're still on that ride?

I'm sorry.

It's just, I'm so happy to be

in your warm and wonderful home.

I was very close to my
neighbors, the Kleins.

In fact, they called me
their honorary Jew.

Stop now.

This is like when you tell Earl

you're practically black.

We'll just get our money and go.

Take our money and go?

What are we, barbarians?

Stay and celebrate a little.

But, out here in the kitchen,
away from the men.

Sit, eat, come.

Three of my favorite things to do.

Good looks and funny.
What a catch.

Hadassa, hand me a spoon.

All 100% kosher and so
gorgeous you could plotz.

This one's seen some
Streisand movies, yes?

Wait until you taste my kugel.

Oh, I love kugel.

Tell me, Esther Rachael, are you
ashkenzi or sephardic Jews?

Someone's been on the Internet.

No way, this is a pasta and a dessert?

Ooh, there he is.

My only son.
My little angel.

The bar mitzvah boy who,
today, becomes a man.

Girls, this is Shmuley and his
friend from next door, David.

Say hello to the girls who made
the cupcakes, boys.

Nice to meet you.

Hadassa, Devorah, enough.

Thank you, go.

Enjoy the party.

Have more kugel.

I'll go ask my husband for your money.

See, this is what I love, Max.

The family, the tradition.

The lasagna with the crazy raisins.

And those two little boys,

could they have been more precious?

Yo, yo, yo, what up cupcake bitches?

I'm fixin' to marry me a beeyatch

who bakes like this, son.

Uh, I don't know what's going on,

but I'm pretty sure boys
and girls aren't

supposed to be socializing, right?

Damn, sweetness, your lips are moving

but your ass is doing all the talking.

Uh... Is that Yiddish?

Oh, boys, there you are, come on.

Say goodbye to the cupcake ladies.

Nice to meet you.

Did that just happen or has my
fever suddenly spiked?

That's the first time I ever saw anyone

acting all pimp who still had pimples.

Yo, yo, yo!

And they're back.

What up, Shawties?

What's crackalackin?

Yo, today my boy became a mans.

That's right.

Got my bar mitzvah done, son.

Preach!

So let's get to it.

How much of my mitzvah money
is it gonna take

for you to pop that top and serve me up

some super fine taytays?

Dude, there is not enough money in the--

how much are we talking?

Max!

Yo, don't get all jealous, vanilla cone.

How about you turn around and
make it pop for daddy?

How would you like it
if I told your mother

right on the other side of that door

how you boys were in here
disrespecting us?

How is you gonna say anything
with your mouth full?

Damn, son!

Come in here, ma.
This way.

Don't say anything to her.

Let's just get our money
and get out of here.

Max, she should know.

You wanna ruin their day
and not get paid?

Just keep it to yourself for
five minutes and we're gone.

I want you to meet
my mother, Hinda Fagel.

Ma, this is Max who made
the kosher cupcakes.

And I'm Caroline.

What did the shicksa say?

She said her name is Caroline.

Who cares what her name is?

She looks like the people that

stole my grandmother's good hutch.

But look at this one.

It's like looking in a mirror.

Oy, she's got a fever.

Oh, Max, oh honey, you're burning up.

Oh, no way, I don't get sick.

I get sick.

You're sick.

You'll come, you'll lie down.

Oh, I'm really fine.

We'll just get our money and head home.

Nonsense.
You'll see my husband.

The doctor.

Stop, wait, where are you taking her?

I'm the one who gets sick.

What did she say?

She says she wants your hutch.

You poor baby.

You have a fever of 102.

Just have to rest, Bubala.

I'm really fine.

That towel thing feels awesome.

It's a cold compress,
it'll bring your fever down.

My husband should be in any minute.

Thanks.

I think it's only right to tell you,

I don't know a lot about my
background, so...

I might not be Jewish.

Please, look at you.

You could be my daughter.

I would have liked that.

Always wanted a daughter.

I always wanted a mother.

Oh, did your mother die young?

Sadly, no.

Ooh, you need a kiss.

Oh, good your soup is ready.

Ess a bissel, tatelleh.

Bissel?

I know bissel.

Of course you do.
You're Jewish.

Okay, I'm Jewish, what the hell.

Oh, we don't believe in hell.

We don't?

Awesome.

Oh, thanks.

Call me Bubby.

Thanks, Bubby.

No one's ever blown on my soup before.

What's wrong with them?

♪ That's my boy,
that's my boy, hey, ho ♪

Oh, there he go!

That's what's up, hooker.

First of all, you just scuffed
his mother's freshly-waxed floor

and secondly, you may think
throwing away your family

traditions is cool now, but in
life, bad things can happen.

And one day, when you find
yourself penniless and sick,

you'll need your nice Jewish family

and you'll call them three times
and they won't answer the phone

no matter how much you need antibiotics.

Damn, boo, I stopped listening
after you said freshly-waxed.

Playa!

Max, I'm giving you some amoxicillin

for you to take home.

Now take it all, even when you

start feeling better.

Yes, Dr. Anshell.

Look what I brought.

Sweets for the sweets.

Ooh.

Uh, wait, wait, wait,
before you eat those,

remember how I said
I might not be Jewish?

- Yes.
- Those might not be kosher.

- What are you saying?
- I'm saying they're not kosher.

What is she saying?

Not kosher!

- What?
- Not kosher!

Spit it out, ma!

Spit it out!

Just a minute, it tastes so good.

- You like that?
- Stop.

- You like that?
- Stop it.

- You like that?
- S--that's it!

Listen, hit me with
one more dead president

and you'll be six feet under
with Biggie and Tupac.

You understand me, Jew-Tang Clan?

Skinny bitch came to play!

What kind of girl brings
non-kosher cupcakes

into a kosher home?

Not me-- I'm not that kind of girl.

Yeah, hi, I think I'm that kind of girl.

Max, what are you talking about?

I made sure every single one of those

was up to a rabbi's high standard.

Yes, well, maybe my rabbi
didn't have such high standards.

I'm so sorry, I burned some
and we were running late

and I figured,
four non-kosher out of 80.

So close.

Max, I told you how important

all those traditions are
to a Jewish family.

Yes, you told me about
tradition and family,

but none of that meant anything
until I felt that cold compress.

And she was nice enough
to put it on my head

and I felt what that feels like.

And then Bubby blew on my soup

before she ate the non-kosher cupcake.

Wait, Bubby ate a non-kosher cupcake?

It's a shanda!

It is a shanda.

I'm hoping shanda means

you're forgiven and
we'll pay you anyway.

We are not taking any money.

That's right, you're not
taking anything.

Except for this compress.

Feel better.

Now go, get out of my sight.

And don't wear short skirts.

Esther Rachel,

I wanna talk to you about your son

Shmuley's behavior today.

What are you talking about?

What did my Shmuley do?

I'll tell you what he did.

He became a man.

That's all he did.

Right, Caroline?

I'll say he became a man.

What are you talking about?

Shmuley!

Stay out of it,

this is not our family.

You and I don't have a family.

They still do.

Let the police tell her about him.

So about my Shmuley.

What do you have to say?

Mazel tov, he's a wonderful,
wonderful boy.

Oh, there you are.

Shmuley, David, say goodbye to
the cupcake girls.

Nice to meet you.

Thank you.

So I see no Max.

She still out sick?

It's her first night back.

She should be here any minute.

Did you wanna order something

or wait for your boyfriend?

Oh, see, this is sad story.

Uh, he broke off with me
to date other woman.

And she had penis.

Yeah, I can't compete with that.

Hi, Earl.

There she is, my long lost love.

How you feeling, Max?

I'm pretty good.

Hey, Bubby.

I brought you some chicken soup

for taking care of me
the last couple days.

I enjoyed being your Bubby.

I guess you were wrong, Max.
You and I do have family--

each other.

We're not family until we have

to testify against each other
in a manslaughter trial.

Here, eat this.

I don't want you to
catch what I just had.

Not gonna happen, Max.

I took your advice.

I manned up.

I stared germs in the face.

That's right, when you got sick,
I got balls.

Booyah!

Like looking in a mirror.

Miss, I'm done here.

Oh, I've been done here for years.

You don't see me getting a parade.

Oh, looks like we lost electricity.

Uh-oh, all the food in the
refrigerator will go worse.

Is it a bad sign that

I can actually see everything better?

Well, we finally found lighting
that made the food look edible.

Yeah, it's almost dark
enough for Caroline

to agree to have sex in here.

Max, have you ever seen balls in light?

They're not pretty.

Nobody panic!

The power is out in the whole building.

We've got less energy
than a Steely Dan concert.

Han, you look exactly like

a Doozer from "Fraggle Rock" right now.

All right, we've got
to keep the diner safe

from hooligans and looters.

You're still on the clock!

And you're on my foot.

Sorry, Earl, I can't
see you in the dark....

But not in a racist way.

And I can't see you in the light

in a short way.

Han, who would loot this diner?

Unless they're looters looking
specifically for disappointment.

Max?

Just taking this vodka

and cash register to a safe place.


Our new dessert bar
is under construction

and it's not quite there yet.

Kind of like the credit card bill

I lied about mailing,

but I've chosen you two to
be the first to get a preview.

She invited other
people. They said, "No."

She told me there would
be some hard candy.

Better be some hard candy.

I have peppermints inside.

Then we're fine.

So it doesn't look like much now,

but with a little
moxie and a lot of work,

it's gonna be gorgeous.

Like Khloé Kardashian.

Is that the one that's a dude now?

Okay, where's my treat?

Impressive,

and you've stolen almost nothing

from the diner to do this.

Oh, wait, I see my sport coat
is being used as a paint rag.

That coat's yours?

I thought it belonged
to a service Chihuahua.

Hey, everybody.

Oh, yeah.

Hubba, hubba, hot stuff.

You know, if I were still single,

I'd let you Spackle my hole.

You heard what she said, beefcake.

I'm not gay.

I'm just very pro-harassment.

I'm proud of you, girls.

You're making your dreams come true,

and my dreams, too,
assuming you'll allow me

to start a tab here.

I'll never pay.

Does this mean you're not
paying your tab at the diner?

Uh-huh.

Earl?

He walks fast when he wants to.

I gotta get going too.

You know, we just came
from the baby doctor,

and he put me on bed rest.

At first I thought the
doctor said, "Bed arrest, '

which is one of my favorite games.

Sophie, what's wrong? Are you okay?

Well, I'm five months along,

and the baby already weighs 15 pounds,

so the doctor's just a little worried.

He's afraid it'll fall out

like a watermelon through
a plastic grocery bag.

Come on, baby, let's get you in bed

and get your legs up.

I can't believe none of
this has to do with sex.

Yeah.

Knock, knock. It's Randy.

I got a six-pack...

And I brought some beers.

Who wants some warm, wet, deli beer?

This is why you're the
best boyfriend ever.

Warm, wet deli beer
is the official drink

of my personality.

So, Randy, look.

What do you think of the new bar space?

I've got a bar-related question.

How you gonna fit in the bar?

It's all right here
on the blueprints, see?

The bar goes here, so
that leaves ten feet

for the cafe tables and
the front door entrance.

Uh, you see this number ten right here?

You see the two dashes after
it? Those are inches, not feet.

You got 10 inches.

First time I've ever been
disappointed with 10 inches.

Well, that's the last
time I get an architect

from the "casual encounters"
section of Craigslist.

Ugh.

The lady from the pizza place
next door is banging back again.

Yeah, they should pay less
attention to our business

and more attention to their own.

There's so much oil on their pizza,

the U.S. might invade it.

You know what?

I think we've just

blown past "warm beers."

I'm gonna go get us some whiskey.

10 inches always looks a
whole lot bigger with bourbon.

Oh, my God, Max, we need more space.

I know; we spend way
too much time together.

Hey!

Enough with the noise, cupcake bitches.

You gotta stop with this
freakin' racket already.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down, Gina.

What, 'cause I'm Italian,

my name's gotta be Gina?

It's Angie. Gina's my middle name.

Oh, I thought your middle
name was "bangs a lot."

Angie, we're expanding our shop,

and we have a permit
for the construction,

so it's above board.

Which, yes, even I'm surprised about.

You got a permit to destroy my business?

Nobody wants to eat pizza

next to this constant freaking racket.

What's your freaking point?

Max, I didn't know you spoke Italian.

Follow me.

I want yous to see
the hell you're making.

Um, that's a firm pass.

- I'll throw in a free slice.
- Okay.

See?

See what you're doing to our office

from all that banging next door?

You're destroying it.

Uh, look, you can't destroy a room

that has this strong of
a "hostage basement" vibe.

You got cracks, and falling plaster,

and my brother and I are fed up.

Right, Angelo?

He says, "Right."

He's my twin.

We agree with our minds.

Um, Angie, when do we
get that free slice?

Not to be pushy, but a deal is a deal,

and today's a carb day for me.

What the frig?

I just got my hair cut for
our high school reunion.

Now it's ruined.

It's a frickin' war zone in here!

My father would be turning in his grave

if we'd been able to
give him a proper burial.

How you gonna make this right?

Look, Angie and Angelo,

we're sorry about the inconvenience,

but it'll just be another
week of construction.

We promise to keep the
noise down to a minimum.

Right, Max?

She's agreeing with her mind.

Hey, just came by to
see if everything's okay,

and to say I've never
seen the statue of David

with a slice of pizza over his junk.

Who's this hunk of gabbagoul?

This hunk is Randy, and he's my...

Lawyer, and I'm sure he's here
to make sure there's no problem.

There's not problem, right, Angie?

The only problem I see
now is that shirt on him.

Hi, I'm Angie,

but I'm thinking about
changing my name to yours.

Props, that's a good line.

So, Angie, what do you think?

Can you stand another
week of the construction?

All right.

I'll give yous two another week,

'cause of Randy here,

but that's the last thing
I ever do for you two.

You, I'd do whatever you want..

Tonight and in perpetuity.

"Perpetuity"?

Better not be Italian for "the butt."

Guys,

I have a genius idea to
fix the dessert bar problem.

What if somehow we could convince Angie

to let us break through the wall
and rent out their back office?

Come on!

This is a genius idea.

Their business is struggling,

and we could pay them rent.

It's either that or we have to use

dollhouse furniture for the dessert bar.

You know what? She's right.

It is a good idea.

You just gotta figure out a
way to get on Angie's good side.

Maybe you bring her a
bouquet of cigarettes.

Okay, Caroline, the only thing
Angie likes about us is him,

and honestly, the only
thing I like about us is him.

That's perfect; we should
bring Randy over there

when we go ask her.

Randy, this has got to work,

so wear a tight shirt,

and maybe put a little
Parmesan behind your ears.

Uh.

So, Angelo, any idea when
your sister is getting back?

Well, it is a long commute from hell.

Oh...

Hi, Randy.

I would make out with you,
but I just got a manicure,

and I like to use my nails.

Next time.

So we came here with
a business proposition,

and some delicious cupcakes.

I'll need the plate back.

Get those away from me!

I'm going to my reunion
in a dress so tight

you could see the kidney Angelo gave me

from when I had renal failure
from drinking too much Tab.

First of all, Angie,
Max and I are so glad

to hear that you pulled
through from the renal failure,

but the real reason we're here is...

did you see Randy?

Look, let's move this along.

We want to bust through this wall

and rent your little pizza hut here.

Well, I'm in charge,

and I'm not renting to yous two.

I don't have time for this.

I still don't have a date
for my reunion tomorrow,

and this stress is bad for my face.

I already have more filler
than a two-hour "Dateline."

Angie, how does a woman like you

not have a date for your reunion?

I mean, not to be too forward,

but hot magenta really
brings out your eyes.

Well, you're not wrong.

You know what would be wrong?

If Randy didn't take you

to your reunion tomorrow night.

Do you want to be punched in
the face with my ring hand?

You know what?

That...

is a great idea.

Angie, I would be honored
to take your to your reunion.

Oh, my God!

Really?

What about Angelo?
What's he supposed to do?

Angelo, do you want to bring
one of these two to the reunion?

They're not my type.

Two fives make a ten, right?

Oleg!

I know we don't really
have standards here,

but the customer said that
her steak shouldn't do this.

Well, tell her not to turn
the plate upside down then.

I'm FaceTiming with Sophie.

She's lonely.

Say "hi" to Caroline.

I'm not that lonely.

Ugh, I just scrubbed a table.

That is how upset I am.

I should have never let
Randy go to that reunion.

And I should have never

let Buddy Holly get on that plane,

but what're you gonna do?

Other than play it over and over again

in your mind for 60 years.

Max, it'll all be worth it

when we get that extra
space for our dessert bar.

Why would God make Randy look like that

if not to help us get stuff?

I'm worried about Randy.

He is strong, but she has the strength

of ten horny women.

Somebody talk to me.

I'm dying here.

I just watched all eight
seasons of "Perfect Strangers."

I'm... I'm just...
I'm... I'm Balki'd out.

I just felt a shift in the force.

Did somebody clean a table over there?

Is everything okay?

She's upset because Angie

from the pizza parlor
next door needed a date

to her high school
reunion, and Randy took her.

Well, that's hurtful.

I've asked Angie out twice.

They're not on a real date, Han.

He's just trying to convince her

to let us rent their back office.

Randy's wasting his time.

It's actually Angie's
delightful brother Angelo

who controls the lease.

Angelo's in charge?

Angelo's "delightful"?

Ugh, I am so bored

that I just got a degree
from DeVry University.

So she tricked Randy

into going to that reunion with her?

I am going to the high school

to get my man back... oh, my God,

I sound just like my mother.

We should go there
and sweet-talk Angelo

into giving us the space.

Oh, but we're "not his type,"

which is a shame, because
I really wanted some of

that 50-year-old
video-game-addict money.

Well, where are we
gonna get tacky dresses

and hair from 1986?

I can make you look like it's 1986

'cause I lived in Poland in 2003!

How you doin'?

How you doin'?

How you doin'?

Oh, Jimmy Vecchio!

It's Max... Blackilini.

Doesn't ring a bell.

What about me?

It's Caroline...

uh, Cacciatore!

Didn't we take math together
with Mr. Bag-a-two-shoes?

Never heard of him.

- Eh!
- Forget about it.

Oh, there's Angelo

dancing by himself.

No surprise there.

Wow, I've never seen a sweat-suit tux.

Angelo.

It's Max and Caroline

from next door.

Um, you probably don't recognize us.

I'm hoping no one does.

What? I can't hear you

with the babe alarm going off.

Whee-ooh, whee-ooh.

Oh, well, same to you.

What is that, terry cloth?

Actually, we came here to talk to you

because we wanted to ask you

about renting out your back office.

We know you're the big cheese.

You know, since you're here,

maybe we, uh, cut a rug?

She hasn't cut her rug in
about four months, so...

We could, uh, start
off on the dance floor,

and if we happen to end up

in the back of an '86 Cutlass Supreme,

so be it.

So be it. Forget about it.

Excuse us.

Max, I am not a whore.

That's not what your hair,
dress, and makeup say.

Look, you pimped Randy
out for that extra space,

and now it's your turn.

You want that back room, make it happen.

On the count of three,

say "sex."

You handle Angelo.

I've been wanting to kill someone

for using a selfie stick,
and she is the lucky one.

Angie, God rest your soul,

get your hands off my boyfriend.

Max, what're you doing here?

Please tell me that's a wig.

She tricked you into coming here.

She is not in charge of the pizza place.

Her brother is. This is my hair.

Angie, is that true?

Did I do the Electric Slide for nothing?

Well, not for nothing.

We came in second in
the dance competition.

Okay, fine, it's true.

Angelo's in charge.

My father thought he was the smarter one

because he wore glasses as a kid.

Randy, are you okay?

Did the bad lady touch you
in any of the good places?

Look, I'm sorry I lied,

but for what it's worth, I'm
having the night of my life.

Believe it or not, I wasn't
popular in high school.

I didn't date a football player

or get pregnant.

For once, I just wanted
to show up a winner.

- Hey, Ange!
- Oh, no.

Here comes Michelle Pascucci.

Please, don't ruin this for me.

Who's this, Ange?

What's she doing holding
on to your fiancé

like he's the last cannoli at a wake?

Forgot to tell you, I got engaged.

Wait.

Unless that's not really your boyfriend.

'Cause, uh, you're known to lie.

Well...

she's not lying.

He's been cheating on
me with her for years.

I, uh, caught 'em at the Olive Garden.

I smell a catfight,

and Drakkar Noir.

Catfight!

- Oh, come here, bitch.
- Oh!

- Just follow my lead.
- Okay, careful.

I spent $65 on my hair.

I was hoping not to
touch it till next week.

- Don't touch my arm, bitch!
- Oh!

Oh, I shouldn't touch your arm?

Maybe you shouldn't touch my guy.

Finally, this party's getting good.

Push me back.

Oh!

Did you just push me?

Yeah, I pushed you,

but not as hard as your boyfriend

was pushing me in the back of the car.

Oh, hell no, bitch!

- Now...
- OH!

I told you not to touch my hair!

- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

She's got a freakin' knife!

All right, I'm out,

but only because...

I'm on parole

for pulling out a woman's
bangs on the F Train.

Let's get out of here, Ange.

Is my hair dented?

I'll fix it, Hun. I got
a chopstick in my purse.

Get over here, you sloppy second.

Wow.

I kind of like having
a knight in shining...

what is this, aluminum foil?

Well, it is warming up the
ravioli I put in my bra.

Max, can I have this dance?

So you think you and I would
have dated in high school?

Well, when I was in high
school, you were in your 30s,

so...

yeah, that sounds right.

I just convinced Angelo to
let us rent the back office.

I mean, I may have to be
his date to the Auto Show.

Wear something nice.

Like a silk blouse

or a bikini.

He wants to show me off.

I never went to anything like this.

A reunion or a prom

or a class.

What do you do at these things?

(upbeat music)

Oh, my God,
the customers are nakey.

Thank God you're seeing it too.

I thought my X-ray vision
was back.

God bless the annual
naked bike ride.

And where's Oleg?

This is the first lunch rush
in years.

Uh, the guy at table three
needs some water

and has an ass mole that should
really get looked at,

but not by me.

Oleg, you're doing
the naked bike ride too?

The naked what?

Okay, gang.

Let's hit the road.

(gasps)

Ugh, oh!

Ooh, ah!

I don't know where to look now.

Nothing's good.

Well, now we have to
burn this place down.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[cash register bell dings]

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Don't try and stop me.

I'll Mountain Dew it.

You know I'm crazy
when I'm all Coked up.

So I heard a lot of noise

coming from your room
last night.

And since I know
that bat is dead,

because it had a heart attack
on my pillow,

I assume you had
a gentleman caller?

He wasn't a gentleman,

but he did wear a monocle
while we did it.

Well, you had a much more
exciting night than I did.

Both of my legs fell asleep
on the toilet.

Then so did I.

So you aren't gonna
see him again?

Well, we know every time
Earl walks away,

there's a chance of that.

I have an announcement.

Whoever keeps putting
peanut butter in my desk,

stop.

I'm allergic.

And I'm closing the diner
Sunday.

Well, we had a good run.

No, we didn't.

Let's scavenge, people!

Bye, y'all!

Where do we keep the money at?

(paper shredder whirring)

What?

I don't want our meat order

to fall into the wrong hands.

No, you pile of felons.

I'm closing the diner
for Sunday only.

Well, I'm keeping this stuff
anyway.

And I really hate it.

My new therapist, Gary,
says that I need

to take a day off
to focus on myself.

Did he give you
a magnifying glass for that?

Max, Gary says you use

your toxic,
mean-spirited jokes

to keep people like me
at a distance.

You know what else works?

Putting my hand
on your forehead.

Max, Gary also says

you have a fear of intimacy

stemming from your father
abandoning you.

To put it simply,
you have daddy issues.

The only daddy issues I have

are of Rod Magazine.

And there's no such thing
as daddy issues.

If there was, why would
my daughter be married

to a forgetful older man
named Burl?

What did Gary say about me, Han?

Were the words "Eliza Doolittle"
used?

Well, you certainly do little,

but actually,
you didn't come up.

You don't come up to my knees.

See? That's the kind
of material you need

to get a shout-out.

Hey, everybody!

Barbara just smiled politely
at her first ugly baby.

Oh, I could learn some manners
from her.

Sophie, it's really not nice
to call a baby "ugly."

Shut up!

Oh, I mean...

(cheerfully)
Shut up!

Good news, Sophie.

I don't have to work here

or Bubzie's Hideaway
this Sunday.

We can get a babysitter

and spend the whole day
together.

Well, if you're suggesting

that we have sex
at the dog track again,

then I'm gonna tell you
what I said at the dog track.

(barking)

Well, now we all need therapy.

Oh, Bobby, I'm so sorry

you have to go to your
great aunt's funeral on Sunday.

I really wanted to get lunch
and some towels at Ikea.

Ooh, if you're going to Ikea,

can you get me
a snars-vaten-woggen?

I need a place to put
my book light.

Okay, I understand.

I guess the real lesson is,

don't lie about your weight
on a hot-air balloon.

I am so, so sorry...

that I had to listen to that
horrible phone conversation.

You know, Max,
it's actually a good thing

that Bobby's aunt
died tragically.

Now we can do inventory here

and get ahead on our books
on Sunday.

Only you could turn a death

into something depressing.

(chuckles) Speaking of
something depressing.

I just came by to let you know

you're late for the diner,

and you know, Max,

I had a working brunch
with Gary,

and he made a good point

as he pretended to reach
for the check.

He said it was unfair of me

to bring up your problems

without offering a solution.

You need to talk to your father.

Han, you are really
overstepping your boundaries,

which is really rude,
because that's my job.

Uh, it's fine.

Yeah, go ahead, Han.

Try and find my father.

I don't know his name,
where he lives,

or where he gets dialysis,
I'm assuming.

So good luck with that.

Here's his name and number.

He lives in Rhode Island,

America's least exciting state.

How did you find that?

That is way over the line,

and I really wish it was me
who had done it.

Unlike Max in high school,

it wasn't easy.

I called the hospital
for her birth certificate,

which led me
to the hall of records,

which then led me
to some forced necking

with a clerk named Shelley.

Sadly, it was a dead end.

So Gary got it for me.

His sister's a psychic
for the police.

So are you gonna call your dad

after all that hard work
Han and I did

to find his number?

I don't know.

This is a huge decision,
and I really want

to think this through.

Max, I think that's
a really smart

and mature decis--

Thought about it.

Okay, we're missing

two bottles of tequila,

but I did find a bloody knife,

so that's a wrap on inventory.

Oh, thank God.

I've been killing myself

with all this paperwork.

It took me 30 minutes
to make this hat.

Max, I know what's really
going on here.

You're trying to hide it
by doing origami,

but you're really thinking
about contacting your dad.

Uh, actually, I was thinking

about where I left
my bloody knife,

but you solved that mystery.

So now I'm thinking
about wrestling.

Wrestling with your emotions?

No, with Jeremy Piven.

Short arms.
I can take him.

Well, in the off-chance you do
want to contact your father,

I used my amazing
jigsaw puzzle talents

to put his number back together.

I was runner-up
in Jigsaw Palooza 2003.

Oh, thank God.

Thank you, Caroline...

for letting me
rip this up again.

You know, I hate to say this,

but Han's not wrong.

How dare you?

Let me finish.

Maybe you do have
some intimacy issues.

I mean, you haven't really dated
anyone since Randy,

and I still don't have a key
to our apartment.

I gave you that screwdriver.
It works.

You're not even a little
curious to meet him?

I guess maybe a little.

Maybe it'll explain some of the
more disturbing things about me,

like how I prefer Cocoa Pebbles
over Fruity Pebbles.

Yes! You can finally
get those answers.

I say we go now,
before you change your mind.

Should we steal some snacks
from the diner

before we steal Han's car?

MAX:
Earl, what are you doing here?

You know you're
off today, right?

Uh, I forgot my weed here.

Then I smoked it.

And now it doesn't matter
where I am.

* Squee, diddly-doo

I'm not working on
my Gary-prescribed day off.

I just swung by to--
to meet a friend...

named Friendo.

He's Italian.

What are you doing here?

We're going to meet Max's dad.

Because of me.

It's my thing now.

So you're giving up
your other thing?

Complimenting yourself

while the customers starve?

Earl, why don't you come with?

I want my real dad
to meet my birth dad.

Sure.
Which one am I again?

Can I come too?

Gary would love to hear
about the man

responsible for my misery.

Isn't that the cartoonist
who erased half your body?

Ugh, great.

Other looters got here first.

This is what happens
when you stop for snacks

on your way to stop
for more snacks.

We're going for a romantic ride
in the country.

We're looking for a farm
where we can do it.

We were just gonna ask Han
to drive us to Rhode Island,

but this is better.

With your minivan,

we can sit much further
from the driver.

Rhode Island?

Are we gonna bury a dead body?

No, but I am coming,

so don't get any ideas.

Well, I haven't been in a van
with this many weirdos

since the second time
I got kidnapped.

All right,
your dad just confirmed.

We're meeting him at 4:00
at the Rhode Island Diner.

Max's reunion with her father
is really humming along

since I took the reins from Han.

Don't kid yourself.

I laid the groundwork.

Don't kid yourself.

You've never laid anything.

Oleg, shouldn't we be
getting off at the next exit?

Do you think we should exit
at 33B, Misty?

FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Ooh, that exit is closed

for construction,
naughty boy.

Since we're having a day off
from Barbara,

I put the GPS on XXX.

Can't a woman just talk to you?

This is why we march.

How about a fun car game?

I spy with my little eye

something that is black.

You better watch yourself, son.

No, I was referring to...

pass.

Max, are you nervous?

You have that nervous
metallic smell you get

when you find out 7-Eleven's
out of hot dogs.

No.

I keep a lot of nickels
in these pants.

(screaming)

Sophie, are you okay?

Yeah, that's just how I wake up.

Are you okay?

FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Ooh, ah!

Bear right at the next exit.

Just like that.

Don't stop!

Okay, Misty.

I think I went to hair school
with your GPS.

FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Object ahead.

Slow down, big boy.

(muffled thump)

Uh-oh, I hit a squirrel

or John Travolta's toupee.

Either way, its legs
are still moving.

(screaming)

Oh, gosh.

I must have fallen asleep again.

*

Hey, Han?

How do you say "hang in there"

in squirrel?

(chittering)

I learned it on Zoboomafoo.

Sophie, next time you scoop up
a wounded animal

with a donut box,

make sure everyone's
had one first.

Aww, he's resting comfortably
on a cruller.

Living my dream, buddy.

He won't die, right?

It's illegal to kill squirrels
in the Ukraine.

Ever since Putin had them
trained as spies.

There's an animal hospital
nearby.

Put the address
in the sexy GPS lady.

I don't care where we go,

I just want to hear
what she does

when we arrive
at our destination.

Not to be that person,

but I'm in charge now,

and this trip is about
Max meeting her dad,

not saving a squirrel's life.

-(gasps)
-Squirrel hater!

(all shouting)

Let's just take him with us.

If this diner's
anything like ours,

there'd be tons of other rodents
for him to play with.

FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Your destination

is in 4,800 inches.

I had her convert everything
to inches.

Makes our trip sound bigger,
doesn't it?

We should plan a march.

(upbeat music)

Table for, uh...

for two.

And the cast of
 American Horror Story: Minivan

will be in a separate booth.

Ooh, do you mind?

I'm pretty hungry.

My donut is covered

in squirrel slobber.

You can't bring outside food
in here.

It's not food.

It's a severely injured
squirrel.

All right, well, sit wherever.

Just don't let it
out of the box.

Do you see that, Earl?

He's firm but fair.

You look like a young Earl.

No, I'm Steve.

That was young Earl's name!

Hey, everybody!

Uh, I'm just going in.

I told your dad to look
for a pretty blonde girl

whose hair is a little longer
than a bob

but shorter than
shoulder-length.

Oh, I forgot to tell him
what you look like.

Well, I have no idea
what he looks like.

I always imagined Louis CK,
but not as hot.

Maybe you do have daddy issues.

On the plus side,
we will never like the same guy.

Gary says
when Max sees her dad,

she's going to get
very emotional.

She could get happy,

then sad.

Basically, hide your forks.

(squirrel chattering)

Oh.

He peed again.

Oh, Lord,

am I peeing?

But these are my best pants.

He peed so much, he turned
this donut box into a pool.

He's really putting the "ew"
in cruller.

Max, if you want privacy
when your dad gets here,

I can go sit
in that other booth.

Can you do that now?

Look alive, everyone!

It's the moment

we've always been waiting for.

At least since Tuesday,

when Gary suggested it.

Then I took over.

Max, make sure you look at me
when you hug him.

Oh, that guy?
I hope not.

No daddy, no daddy, no daddy.

What was wrong with him?

(sighs)
Besides his jeans,

arms, legs, face,
and overall vibe?

You know it would be bad

if you were attracted to him,
right?

*

You know, I was a cashier

when I was your age.

Yeah?
What do you do now?

-Cashier.
-(laughs)

-But this is just temporary.
-Temporary.

-No, I have actual dreams.
-Dreams.

No, seriously, man.

-I play saxophone.
-Saxophone.

I quit.

Attaboy.

You know, Han,

you should get your chef
to make flapjacks like this.

He does enough flapping
and jacking on his own.

I think this squirrel's asleep.

He's snoring
and clutching his nuts.

Aww, just like you do.

Han, will you watch the squirrel

so we can just have one minute
to ourselves?

No, I'm watching the door
for Max's--

how do I put this nicely?

"Monster who left her
as a child."

He's gonna be here.

Why am I so positive?

The only reason I know
where my dad is

is 'cause he's in prison.

Ooh, live one coming in.

This guy looks like he's missed
a few soccer games.

If that jabroni is him,
tell him I'm not here.

Max, one of these losers

is gonna be your dad.

I mean, we're in Rhode Island.

I'm gonna get a quick refill.

I got it, hon.
I'm in the industry.

Caroline, I'm starting to think

he's not going to show.

You really screwed
the pooch this time.

Me?

Yeah, this is your thing now.

You took the reins, remember?

You're Trevor Noah,

and I'm Jon Stewart.

I've got my Emmys.

I'm done now.

Well, you started this.

And after I finally
got her over Randy.

The night terrors just stopped.

I was terrified of her at night.

You can sleep
with a cheap Taser now.

I already do.

For the same reason!

Quiet!

The squirrel is sleeping.

We just got him down.

And we'd like to make out.

I spilled a lot of syrup
on myself.

Let's just wake Earl up
and get out of here.

My dad's not coming.

(snoring)

Maybe your dad's
still on his way.

I heard traffic's building up
on all the expressways.

Kind of an ironic name,
wouldn't you say?

"Expressway"?

More like "slow-way."

This is Caroline's thing.

Let's just go.

I want to get back
before Cinnabon

gives away their day-olds.

You know we own
a dessert bar, right?

Maybe he's still gonna come.

If I know one thing about
the man I know nothing about,

he is not coming.

Are you disappointed?

No.

A little.

But maybe it's for the best
he didn't come.

This is why I didn't want
to meet him, because whoever

comes through that door
is just gonna disappoint me.

And this way, I get to imagine
he's someone cool,

like Burt Reynolds

or Captain Crunch.

So you're really okay?

Yeah.

We had a great day.

Road trip, met a cool squirrel.

I don't need another loser
in my life.

I have you guys.

Gary!

Max's father didn't show.

How does that make me feel?

Terrible!

I don't think Han's handling it

as well as I am.

Honestly, if it were my thing,

I would want to kill myself
right now.

She's hurt,
and she's family to me.

How does that make me feel?

Like I should have gone
to an out-of-network doctor!

God, I made Han have a meltdown
on my day off.

You calm down, Gary!

I won't count to ten.

You count to ten, you bastard!

Hey, welcome to the, uh...

hey, uh, what the hell
is this place called, anyway?

Oh, my God.

Dad!

Hold on, Gary.

A vagrant that could very well

be Max's father
just walked in.

Pretend you're my dad,
and I'll give you 40 bucks.

Throw in a joint,
and we have a deal.

Maybe you are my dad.

Oh, no, I don't have kids.

Too much pot.

(laughs)

Guys, this is my dad.

I'm the hot girl's dad.

Was anyone else expecting a cop?

I mean, you know, for the irony.

I'm Caroline.

See, it's, like,
not a bob,

but it's not shoulder-length.

I'm responsible
for this reunion.

Um, he's not really my dad.

I'm doing this for Han.

All right, everybody.

Uh, my dad and I have had

a heartwarming reunion,

and now he has to get to
a secret mission.

In an exotic locale.

Sure.

But I can't leave the county.

Sure.
Local secret mission.

Hey, you seem like a nice kid.

Your father should be proud.

Thanks.

Sorry about the outburst, Gary.

You know it stems
from my mother's expectations.

(exhales)
Thanks for doing this, Han.

Anyone in the hug business?

I didn't even flinch.

We are making progress.

You coming, Earl?

Sure am.

Don't want to get stuck

being a cashier my whole life.

SOPHIE: Oleg, you forgot
the damn squirrel.

Come on, little guy.

We don't abandon anybody.

Here you go, Earl.

Table 12 throwing down
a credit card on a patty melt.

They really need
those eight airline miles?

Where they going... New Jersey?

Credit cards are the downfall of America.

Well, credit cards and Kim Kardashian.

I like her big ass
as much as the next man,

but don't go give
the damn butt a franchise.

Max, I can take a lot.

Please keep your sex life to yourself.

I handled it
when I lost my fortune,

and I handled it
when I lost my fortune.

You said that twice.

Because I think it bears repeating.

But this is too much.

That couple that just left...
a $50 check, a $1.47 tip.

47 cents?

Uh, I wasn't even aware they
were still making pennies.

I smiled and bent over
backwards, giving them service...

all for $1.47?

This makes me the lowest-paid
hooker in New York.

All right, give me that check.
I'll handle this.

Hey!

Was something wrong with the service

my girl over here gave you?

No. Tipping's an option.

So is me spitting in your food.

You might want to remember that

the next time you leave
a waitress pennies.

I'm sorry. I didn't know.

This was our first
and last date.

Sorry, dude.

Looks like this little tip

just lost you the chance
to give her your little tip.

Max, come in, sit down.

There's something
we have to talk about.

This can't be about my drinking.

I don't have the money
to be a real alcoholic.

Can you sit in that chair, please?

I never sit in that chair.

Well, today we're doing things differently...

And I went to Starbucks

and got you a coffee
and a vanilla bear claw.

A Bear Claw? Awesome!
I'll sit anywhere you want.

My life is not where I want it to be.

That $1.47 tip
was a wake-up call

reminding me that life
will always undervalue you

if you let it.

Yes, I've been knocked down,

but now it's time to fight back
and grab life by the balls.

I don't know if life likes
having its balls grabbed.

Some guys do, but those
are usually the ones

who want you to spoon them.

I'd like to explain
my vision for our future

by walking you through...

My vision board.

- Oh, no.
- It's a simple tool.

You're a simple tool.

You start with a thin, white board...

Your thin, white, and I'm bored.

Keep going.
I can do this all day.

I have a Bear Claw in me.

I've been making
vision boards for years,

and I always achieve my goals.

And you think
it's that crazy little board

and not your father's billions?

- Max, it works.

You put up pictures
and inspirational words

of things you want in your life.

See? I have success,
a cupcake business,

and a picture
of a beautiful new bed.

Ah, the ones at the Asylum
look different than that,

so don't get attached.

Sleeping on that couch
is holding me back.

I never get
a restful night's sleep,

and I need a good nine hours.

What you need
is a good nine inches.

That should be
on your vision board.

It is... on the back.

Nice.

Now, unless you're willing
to switch the bedroom

every other week...

No, that sounds mormon.

Then I want to install
a murphy bed in here.

The bed folds up against
the wall during the day,

so you'd still maintain
your signature Williamsburg

"I don't care about anything
chic or nice" decor.

Who's going to build it?
'Cause it's not me.

I'm already
being taken advantage of

at my babysitting job.

Peach has me lugging things
back and forth

to help with the twins'
first birthday party.

I've been sorting through
clown resumes for a week.

Peach is throwing a birthday party?

Did you ask her
if we can cater the desserts?

She hires fancy people
with real companies.

We're not a real business.

See? This is what I'm talking about.

You mock the vision board, but look...

here it is, our cupcake shop.

I don't think we can both
fit in there.

Max, you have to start imagining

what our life can be.

You deserve a cupcake shop,
and I deserve a new bed.

All you have to do is dream it.

No, all you have to do is do it.

And for you to build
a Murphy bed,

it'll take a miracle.

So unless you have Jesus
or Jesus

on that board...

Not going to happen.

Who is it?

It's Jesus...

From Williamsburg hardware.

We got your do-it-yourself
Murphy bed.

See how I made that happen?

Vision.

So which one of them
has the nine inches?

Guess what I did today?

Jesus?

What do you think?

I think the bed still isn't built.

No, but it's almost finished.

Look...

Notice anything different
about me?

I have answer.

You had boob job.

Your "b"s
have turned into "c"s,

and for that,
I give you an "a."

No, I had my uniform altered.

Yes, life dealt me a bad uniform,

but with a little vision,

I can shape it
the way it works best for me.

That should be a tip
in your inspirational book,

which I'm guessing is called

cutting pictures
out of magazines

isn't just
for serial killers anymore.

And this is exciting... look.

The other really important thing
I did today...

made us business cards.

Now you can give one to Peach

and throw our hat
into the party ring.

You're her babysitter.
You already have a connection.

Yeah, a connection
to her babies' asses.

See? That's your limited vision.

Plus, Peach is interviewing
this gay guy

who used to work
for Martha Stewart.

I mean, gay, Martha Stewart...
we can't top that.

Just give her the cards.
We have to start somewhere.

See?
"Max's homemade cupcakes."

And look...
"Max Black, owner/baker."

"Owner/baker"?

That's pretty cool.

See? There it is.

It's real.

But the name sucks a big one.

"Homemade"...
it sounds like homeschooled,

like we're churning out
cupcakes

that aren't comfortable
around other people.

Or it sounds delicious.

And the cupcake on the card
has a cherry on it.

My cupcakes
don't have a cherry...

haven't since I was 13.

If you could really get
under his shoulder blades...

that's where he carries
all his stress.

Don't say your real thoughts.

Don't say your real thoughts.

Max, we're using our spa voice today.

Use my spa voice?
Okay.

I can't afford this.

I want you to make sure

the twins drink lots of water after,

you know, to flush out
the toxins.

Toxins?

All they drink is breast milk.

I can't be sure
what the woman I buy that from

puts in her body.

We're all so tense
about the birthday party.

If everything isn't perfect,

how will they live
with the shame?

Um, Peach, um...

Speaking of the... the party,

uh, I-I started this,
um, thing,

and it's probably dumb, but...

I don't need it.
Like, I'm fine.

I don't need it.
It's just more like...

like a... like a...
Favor.

Um, but, uh, the thing is,
there's the cards,

so I was thinking may...
"maybly"...

"maybly"? What's that?
It's not a word, right?

- I was not saying a word.
- I'm sorry.

I'm done with whatever this is
that you're doing.

I have to go meet
the Martha Stewart queen

and hear his party pitch.

Just remember,

at 3:00, the twins
have their spray tans.

Well, that's exactly
how I envisioned that.

Let me see
what you're drawing, Johnny.

A rat with a civil war hat.

Is that your comment on how
politicians view soldiers?

No, it's an actual rat
I saw wearing a hat.

See, when you tend bar
till 4:00 a.m.,

you see a lot of weird stuff.

And when you waitress
till 2:00,

you see a loser
drawing a rat on a napkin.

Now sign it, please.

Hmm.

You realize my art won't be
worth anything till I'm dead?

Why do you think
I keep inviting you here to eat

week after week?

Question...

how does it feel
to be the owner

of an original piece
of napkin art

worth roughly...

Less than the worth
of the napkin?

Well, I got to get
back to work.

All right, bye.

Pick up... table ten.

I watch you over there.

Much sexual tension
with deadbeat bartender.

He's not just a bartender.
He's a street artist.

And all I did was bite
a piece of celery.

When I think of all the times
I asked you to bite my celery...

And nothing.

Okay, my side work's done,
and my tables are all caught up.

So, tell me,
did you give Peach the card?

No, I didn't.

- Why?
- It was like

my mouth wouldn't
let me do it.

That's crazy.

What's so hard
about going up to Peach

and saying,
"good afternoon, Peach."

"Exciting news...
I started a cupcake business."

"Here's our card."

"Please pass them out
to all your friends,

and help us launch our exciting
new business venture."

"Thank you."

That sounds needy,

like when someone asks you
to come to their one-woman show.

"Somebody date-raped me,

and I didn't think
I'd live through it,

but I did,
and now I'm stronger,

and, uh, still needy."

There is nothing needy
about having a quality product

and wanting it out there.

Look at Earl... he has a CD on display.

Yeah, but he's cool about it.

He doesn't get all
late-night infomercial

and shove them
down people's throats.

Earl?

How many CDs have you sold
at the diner?

Well, in this current economy...

It's been pretty light.

- May I?
- Mm-hmm.

Hi.

You guys
look like music lovers.

This is the best saxophone CD
you will ever hear...

recorded by our cashier Earl Samson.

He's played
with all the greats...

Coltrane, Hancock,
even Bacharach.

His music career derailed
due to a heroin addiction,

but now he's clean and sober

and, at 83,
still following his dream.

Only $9.95 a copy.
Who'd like one?

Thank you!

Earl, four CDs.

Is any of that true?

Nope. She even made up
my damn last name.

That girl can sell.

Oh! Max...

Will you come
look at Brangelina?

I think the spray-tan lady
went a little too far.

I wanted them to look tan,
not foreign.

A little lebanese,

but that'll clear up
in a day or two.

I'm having the worst day.

Jessica Seinfeld stole
the Martha Stewart boy.

I am so upset with her.

I thought we were pretending
to be friends.

And now I have no one
to do the desserts.

- Hello, Peach, exciting news...

I have a cupcake business.
They're really good.

Give these to your friends
and help launch

a new business
or whatever.

That's it. I did it.
Boom!

Okay, the bed still isn't built.

But the mattress came,
and it's so good.

Oh, no... this is not okay.

We're not keeping a mattress
on the floor.

We're poor,
not crackheads.

And you tricked me.

I did my part,
so you better get this bed done.

Max, you gave Peach the cards.

I'm so proud of you.
What did she say?

No. Shut it. Do it.

Relax. The bed will be assembled

and hidden in the wall
by the end of the day,

'cause I decided to do

what cute girls
have been doing for centuries.

I asked a guy for help.

You called a guy?

Oh, is he going to climb up
your long blonde hair

and rescue you
from your murphy-bed tower?

Wait.
You don't know any guys.

Who did you invite?

- Johnny.
- No. No, no, no, no.

Eh, I don't want to see Johnny.

I had a weird thing with him
at the diner last night.

I thought you guys were friends.

I don't know what we are.

He was fake interviewing me
with a celery stalk...

'Cause you're both grown-ups.

And when he put it
near my mouth,

I thought he wanted me
to bite it, so I...

- You bit it?
- I bit it!

- That is weird
and humiliating and hot.

Yes, yes, and, yes.
Call him right now!

He can't come over here.
Look around!

I have his napkins
hanging up everywhere.

He'll think I'm dexter.

Don't answer that.

- Don't you...
- Come on in, Johnny.

Yes, I did it.
I need a bed.

You are so selfish!

Yes, I'm selfish,
and you're Dexter.

So, quick... help me take down the napkins.

Oh, god, there are so many!

How come I never noticed
how many there were before?

I don't know.
Same reason you didn't notice

your father stealing
everybody's money.

Really? Really?
Now when I'm helping you?

You're right.
We'll trash you later.

Why don't you just ask him
what the celery moment meant?

I don't want to ask him.

You don't want to ask
anybody anything.

It's not like the business cards.

What am I going to say?

"Good afternoon, Johnny."

"Exciting news... I have started

an oddly sexual
celery-biting business."

Be right there, Johnny!

Yo.

So I brought tools...
per your request...

and beer, I made
an executive decision on.

So that's what you do
with my art.

Just one, and I put it up there.

She doesn't even like it... she's like,

"why would anyone hang up
stupid napkin art?"

Right off my back.

Had a couple of these
on the subway.

So here's the wood.

You can't help her...

she needs to learn a lesson
about doing things for herself.

She thinks we're her daddy,
and we'll go back on our word,

and she'll get a pony.

Well, you can see
why she'd think that.

I'm going to see
if the horse wants a beer.

Hmm, maybe put my glasses on him...

get crazy up in this piece!

When you're out there,
ask him what the celery meant.

Get busy, princess.
Daddy's got company.

Well, little lady,
I reckon a cowboy'd get used to

a pretty sweet setup like this.

It's a hard life
out on the trails.

Yeah, it's hard
for my people, too,

since you stole all our land

and gave us blankets
covered in smallpox.

I do declare,

I'm sorry
for the disease blankets.

But they did
keep you warm, I bet,

until they killed you, that is.

"I do declare" is not cowboy.

That's Southern Belle.

I think you're looking
for "darn tootin'"

or "dag nab it."

Cowboys did not say "dag nab it."

Yeah, they did.

"Someone done gone stole
my horse, dag nab it."

I think you're thinking "doggone it."

No, "dag nab it"... cowboy.

Do you really think you know
cowboy better than me?

Which one of us has a horse?

Which one of us has assless chaps?

Should I go inside
and help Caroline?

No. I'm sure she's doing just fine.

Can I ask you something?

Sure.

When you put the sss...

we should get on the horse!

- Okay.
- Yeah!

Use three-inch lag screw

to secure ledger board
to wall studs

"aboot" every 12 inches.

Ooh! Your canadian voice is so dull,

I can't understand
a word you're saying.

There's got to be a video
with a better voice.

"How to build a Murphy bed... Morgan Freeman."

Interesting bit of information about horses...

they hurt your balls.

Yeah, mine hurt, too.

You would think after all these years

of riding a horse,
man would have evolved

to have his balls on top
instead of underneath.

Life would be so much easier.

Well, yeah, but I don't see
a lot of old-timey ladies

wanting to get
with the top balls.

Are you thinking
about the celery?

No, I'm still thinking about my balls.

Now I'm thinking about the celery.

That was weird, right?

Not weird, really... more, um, intense.

Intense good or intense bad?

Intense intense.

Whoo.

Whoa. Oh. Did I just grab your...

yeah, I don't know.
"Maybly."

"Maybly"!
That's not a word, right?

- I should...
- I got to get down.

Me too.

My balls.

So take your makeup brush,

take your mirror,
and you want to comb

your eyebrows upwards.

What are you doing?

Okay, okay.

I thought I typed in "Morgan Freeman."

But I'm so tired,
what came up was "more gay men""

but this damon guy is a genius.

If he had a video
on how to build a Murphy bed,

it'd already be done.

Wait. Where's Johnny?

What happened?
Did you ask him?

No, he left.

Out the back?

Yeah, it got even weirder.

He grabbed my boob.

Or... he didn't grab my...

he grabbed my boob.

I just don't know
whether it was on purpose.

But I asked,
like you told me to,

and now I have
a weird boob moment

to go with my weird
celery moment.

That is very complicated.

But I'm great
with relationship stuff.

So come on over here,
and we'll hammer it all out

while we hammer this all out.

Come on, this is
where you break down

and finally help me
build the bed.

No, this is where I go
to my already-built bed.

And after Peaches today and...

Whatever that was out there
with my boob,

I'm not showing anyone
my cards anymore...

business or personal.

Go in!

Go in! Oh!

What is happening out here?

That's the kind of pounding
that's supposed to happen

after you're in the bed.

I can't do it.

I tried.
I really did, but I can't.

I guess I can't do anything
without my father's money.

You were right.

Trying is embarrassing.

So I'm not going to try
anymore.

I'm sick of it.

I'm going to sleep on that horrible couch

and get bad tips
and cry

every waitress day
for the rest of my life.

Daddy, please.

God, you're a baby.

Okay, I'll help you...
this one time only.

And we're not going
to bond when we do it.

We're not going to high-five
when we finish.

And I don't want to hear
two months from now,

"hey, remember that night
we built the Murphy bed?

That was awesome."
None of that. Got it?

We need the power drill,

1/4-inch bit,
some masonry screws,

and a Bear Claw.

Now delete "eyebrows,"

type in "Murphy bed,"
and let's build this mother.

I can't believe we did it.

Yeah, it looks pretty good.

Oh, Max.

You put the bakery up
on your vision beam.

Say anything more,
and I'll take it down.

Do you know this number?

That's Peach.

- Why would she call you?
- It's about

the cupcake business...
my number's on the card.

Put it on speaker.

Hello?

I found your card
in my baby's room.

I have no idea who you are
or how it got there,

but I'm throwing
a birthday party in a week,

and I thought cupcakes
might be fun.

Oh, they are.

People love cupcakes.

They bring a sense
of whimsy and nostalgia.

That's enough.

Why don't you tell me

some of the other events
you've done?

Oh, well,
we're a start-up company.

Oh, no,
I need a real business.

Bye-bye.

Well, there you go...
complete waste of our time.

See?
Trying is embarrassing.

No. That was great, incredible.

What? She hung up on you.

Yes. But it proves one thing.

The cards... they worked!

This is so inspiring.

First we build a Murphy bed,
next a cupcake business,

then, Max...

Who knows what else?

Uh, adjust the springs?

No, that's perfect.

Got a marriage proposal in the diner.

Where they gonna honeymoon...
a Porta-Potty?

That's the saddest thing I ever seen,

and I was at a Rolling
Stones concert last night.

The guy wants me to put
this ring her pie.

'Cause you know what they say...

If you like it, then you
gotta put a ring in it.

Well, this is a first.

A guy left me a half a
tuna sandwich as a tip.

Which is still more
than Europeans leave.

There's a proposal at table 40,

and you have to do it.

I already delivered a
baby in here today.

Well, they've obviously
been dating a while,

'cause she's eating
carbs in front of him.

Caroline is so happy right now.

She still believes in
all that love crap.

Uh, she also believes
table 14 is table 40.

Here's your pie.

I have a feeling this dessert
is gonna be extra-sweet.

It's an engagement ring!

He hid it in the pie!

Yes! Yes, I'll marry you.

I know I said I was cool with waiting,

but I wasn't cool with it!

Yep. She messed up. This isn't yours.

Um... again. I'm cool with waiting.

And for you two, pie on the house,

and I'm guessing a very
tense cab ride home.

Where's Earl? He isn't here yet,

and I'm worried.

Wait... it's not a black holiday, is it?

Earl better not be dead,
or I'll kill him.

We have a joint suicide pact.

We smoke a joint and
then we kill ourselves.

He's probably just late.
Don't overreact.

That's exactly what Janine
at 911 said ten minutes ago

when I overreacted with her!

You called 911?

When I came home three
hours late last night,

you had already put all my
stuff out on the street.

Hi, everybody!

Wait a minute... where's Earl?

It's not as much fun walking in here

if he's not down there
looking up at my boobs.

He's late.

[gasps] Late?

Oh... I'm sorry, Max.

I know you two were close.

See? That's the kind of
sympathy I was looking for

from you and Janine.

Sophie, what's with those needles?

Oh, yeah... I'm getting
ready to shoot up.

Sophie's starting her
fertility shots today.

Before long, we'll be parents.

Look out, PTA meetings...

I'll bring the P. She'll bring the T&A.

All right, come on, Oleg.
I'm ready for my first shot.

Come on, let's go to the ladies' room

so you can poke me real good.

You're not poking her anywhere in here.

Thanks to you, the handicap

Sophie, you know I'm only
afraid of two things...

needles and Kenny Rogers
after the eyelift.

He did not know when to fold 'em.

Someone else will have
to give you your shots.

Well, I guess I could do it.

Roll up your sleeve.

Okay, yeah.

I'll roll up my sleeve...
and then pull down my Spanx,

'cause you gotta put it where
the sun don't shine, baby.

Uh... this is a little
awkward, but Sophie,

I was unaware I'd be
injecting your badonkadonk.

Okay, Han.

Take my hand...

That's right. Mm-hmm.

That's real good. All right, come on.

And I'm gonna take you now

to show you your first lady butt.

Now, there's a heart-warming tableau

that Norman Rockwell somehow missed.

Hello, ladies.

Earl! I'm so glad you're alive.

You always go straight to dead, Max.

But thanks for sending the paramedics.

I needed help finding
my Apple TV remote.

I was stuck on the phone with Barry

from my old jazz band The Early Birds.

You may have read about us
in "Never Made It" magazine.

Caroline and I were on
the cover last week.

He told me they're holding
an anniversary show

down at Ruby's,

and The Early Birds
are invited to perform

on Friday night.

[gasps] Earl!

One of my dreams is to
hear you play live.

And the other one already happened...

breakfast all day at McDonald's.

Well, I hate to burst
your McMuffin, Max,

but that ain't gonna happen,

'cause I'm not invited to play.

Ruby doesn't want me there.

Ruby hates Earl.

Well, then Max hates Ruby.

Oh! What happened between you and Ruby?

Was it a crazy love affair?

Mm-hmm. We were hot.

Oh! An amour fou?

No, it was a-more I fooled
around with her sister.

Look! [gasps] Earl and The Early Birds!

- Where'd you get that?
- I went down the street

to Smart & Vinyl.

12.95.

You spent 12.95 on Earl's record,

but you wouldn't lend me
25¢ for a latte yesterday?

Look, we gotta do something about Earl.

He deserves to play at that jazz club.

I mean, he is the only
one at this diner

who has a chance to make it.

I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but of all of us here,

you think the 80-year-old
has the brightest future?

For as long as I've known Earl,

all he talked about is how
proud he was of that band.

And that Ruby woman

is denying him the
chance to play again?

Not on my watch.

If I own one.

Which... I do not.

We are going down to that club

and talk some sense into Ruby,

because Earl would do the same
for us if we had any talent.

I just have to ask...

you do think we're gonna
get out of here one day.

Oh, for sure!

In body bags.

Wow, this place is the real deal!

All the jazz greats sang here.

Look... Ella Fitzgerald,
Sarah Vaughan, Nina Simone.

You know, there was a moment
when I wanted to be...

Was there ever a moment
when you wanted to be quiet?

Scotch on the house, please.

Normally, I don't drink
in the afternoon,

but it's still morning.

I'll have a Lillet.

I hear it was Billie Holiday's poison.

You know, there was
a moment when I was...

That moment's over.

Sir, we're here to see Ruby.

Who wants to see Ruby?

She's coming in real hot, Max.

Maybe this isn't a good idea.

There's only one old
woman who scares me,

and his name is Steven Tyler.

I'm Ruby.

Well... if it isn't

"Miss doesn't invite people to stuff."

Who's also known as
Miss Very, Very Pretty.

I don't need someone to
tell me that I'm pretty.

That's what I told Roy Orbison

when he wrote "Pretty Woman for me.

What do you little girls want?

We're friends of Earl.

- Of Earl?
- You know, Earl.

From The Early Birds.

You know, the guy who put
this club on the map.

Oh, that Earl!

He's a bum!

Girl, you better check yourself!

No one says anything bad about my Earl.

Your Ear... Well, I
prefer not to go to jail

for murdering Earl's girlfriend, but...

it's not that strong a preference.

Here, hold my hoops!

Oh, no, no, no, no.

Max isn't Earl's girlfriend.

He's more like a father-figure to her.

More like a great-grandfather figure!

He's both! Hold my hoops!

Everybody calm down, take a beat.

A jazzy beat, of course.

I only have two questions for you...

Why is she so upset?

And what the hell is a jazzy beat?

I'm upset because I know
Earl helped build this club,

and he wasn't invited to
play your anniversary show.

That's right... 'cause he's a bum!

Hold my hoops again!

That no-good, two-timin' musical genius

will never set foot in
my club while I'm alive.

Here, hold my hoops while
I unstrap the pistol on my shoe.

Ruby, come on, can't
you just let him play?

I mean, he's just a
cashier at a diner now.

What'd you just call him?

Earl is more than just a cashier.

That is his job, not what he is.

How dare you!

Yeah, how dare she!

Both: Hold my hoops!

Hold your hoops! I'm sorry.

He's not a cashier.
He's a musical genius.

Damn it.

I can't believe that Earl would end up

in a dead-end job as a
cashier in a diner.

Well, I mean, it doesn't
have to be a dead-end.

He could get out anytime...

him and the other
people that work there.

All right, he can come.

But just make sure he
shows up and he is sober.

That man only has two settings...

"high off his ass"
or "not in the room."

He'll be here.

Okay, I don't know
whose hoops are whose.

We got a real "whose hoops" over here.

Isn't that exciting, Earl?

You're playing at the club!

I'm gonna go ahead
and call it a comeback.

And then I'm gonna go find
an outfit that I can take back.

So, Earl, obviously, I'll be your date,

and obviously, we'll pretend
that we don't know Caroline.

I can't believe that you
girls went to see Ruby

and came back with your hoops and hair.

But there's one problem:
I no longer own a saxophone.

How can you not own a saxophone?

That's like me not owning muh jugs.

I sold it 'cause I needed the money.

I had just kicked heroin,

and I was buying a lotta cocaine.

But thanks, girls.
It would have been really nice.

Aw, Earl, that's too bad.

I was really excited to see the show.

I think when we went to Ruby's,
I caught the jazz bug.

In my day, when you caught
the jazz bug, you had syphilis.

Obviously, we have to
get Earl a saxophone

so he can play in the show.

Max, if you put this much
effort into our life,

we'd be off the cover of
"Never Made It" magazine.

We can't afford a musical instrument.

Trust me, if there's
anything I know how to find,

it's cheap sax.

So, Earl, you're back in
your old stomping grounds.

How's it feel?

Should bring back a
lotta memories, huh?

It sure should!

There's my girl!

She and I used to have
a lot of great talks.

Earl, you played with Ella Fitzgerald?

It's possible.

Or else I talked to that picture.

I did a lot of drugs.

Whenever I think of Ella,
I just want to

♪ Scooby-Doo-bop-bop,
squiddly dop-dop-bah ♪

Do that again, and I'm gonna
squiddly-da-bop you in the head.

I gotta admit, I'm excited to play.

I got my mojo working

and my pacemaker on cruise control.

I appreciate all the trouble, girls.

Just don't forget us
when you make it big.

And we won't forget you
when we make it big.

Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

Ahh! Well, well, well.

Earl with a couple of
18-year-old white girls.

It's the '60s all over again.

If it was the '60s,

you and I would be in the coat closet

gettin' on the good foot
doin' the bad thing.

You look beautiful as ever, Ruby.

Well, Earl,

I must say, you look...

Wiser? Distinguished?

Mature like a fine wine.

I was gonna say less on heroin.

I haven't done smack in 30 years.

I even quit Honey Smacks

'cause I thought it might tempt me.

Ruby, just putting it out there...

if you need someone
to warm up the crowd,

I was in my high school's jazz choir.

I sang "God Bless the Child."

[chuckles] Well, God bless the children

that had to listen to that.

Well, it's gonna be
very interesting, Earl.

I don't think I ever
remember you playing sober.

You always said the
junk gave you the funk.

- I did?
- Mm-hmm.

Well, that was clever.

You know what wasn't clever?

Leaving your underpants on
my sister's breakfast table.

Anyway, break a leg. Or... a heart.

You're good at that.

I was good at a lot of
things with you, Ruby.

[lecherous giggle]

[chortling]

Girls, I just realized...

I never played straight.

Excuse me, ladies.

I have to freshen up in the men's room.

You don't think "freshen up" means...

what I think we both think it means.

No. Earl's been clean for 30 years.

Plus, you don't just
go into the bathroom

of a jazz club where you
did heroin to find heroin.

I'll just go take a peek.

Earl's still in the bathroom.

You know what's not in the bathroom?

Doors on the stalls.

Damn it! I forgot I invited people.

Hey, girls, come on.

Admit it... everyone hates jazz, right?

Well, I love it.

See? It's the worst!

I like going downtown.

I don't have to tell you that.

Where's Han?

He's standing right under me, isn't me?

Ooh! $15 a drink.

That's your whole night in Secaucus!

Han, I can't take shots and jazz

and your personality at the same time.

Sophie, relax. It'll be fine.

I'll buy you a drink first.

Hold my syringe while
I get my credit card.

Who are you, my mom?

Oh, Earl, how you doing?

Max, that's real sweet of you

to score some dope for
me, but I'm gonna pass.

No. These are Sophie's fertility drugs.

All this'll give you is great breasts.

Still no. If I had great breasts,

I'd never get out of bed.

Good evening. My name is Ruby.

And in case you forget that,

it's written in neon
all over the place.

- You ready?
- Yep. Ready to leave.

- What?
- You heard Ruby.

I've never played not high,

and I'm not about to try it now.

Now, I know you're all here
for The Early Birds tonight,

so hang onto your hats
and hide your sisters.

[chuckling] And help me
welcome back to the stage

The Early Birds, featuring Earl!

[applause]

Earl!

Oh, a-am I still here?

In my mind, I was running so fast.

Earl... we're waiting for you. [chuckles]

He's acting like the stage

wants him to commit to a
monogamous relationship.

You know what I'm talkin'
about, right, ladies?

Whoo-hoo! Yeah, jazz is funny!

Boys, y'all know the drill.
Vamp! Vamp, boys, vamp.

[band begins set]

You gotta go up and buy us some time

so I can convince Earl to get up there.

Max, I don't know if I could do that.

Should I go with "God Bless the Child"

or "Lady Sings the Blues"?

Quit adding white things to you.

You're already the whitest person here.

Just go.

Hey, there, you crazy cats.

Earl will be out in a hot second.

How y'all doin'?

And-a one, and-a two, and-a three...

martinis over on this table!

You know when someone else
says something stupid,

but you're embarrassed?

Earl, I thought this
would make you happy,

but if you don't wanna
play, we can just go.

- Then let's just go.
- Damn it, Earl!

Follow along, boys.

Just keep it bright and breezy,

and "God Bless the Child."

(Barry) Is this a joke?

[laughter]

I'm gonna have to shoot up
myself to get through this.

Sometimes when the crickets
start chirpin' down South

late on a summer's night...

Seriously... is this a joke?

[laughter, murmuring]

I just have to break into this song.

Oh, lord.

♪ Scooby-Doo-bop-bop ♪

♪ Squiddly dop-dop-bah ♪

Somebody shoot me!

[laughter]

You know what, Max, it turns out

I don't need junk to get up there.

I just needed Caroline
to start singing.

Let's fly, Birds.

[snapping] A-five, six, seven, eight.

It was a big night for him.

getting back on the horse.

But I'm pretty sure
he got back on Ruby.

I know he got back on her,
'cause I had to hold her hoops.

I hate to say this,

but I'm a little jealous of Earl.

He got a chance to do
what he's best at again.

I'm beginning to think I
may never get that chance.

Aw, were you holding on to hope?

Stop. You have time. Earl's 80.

You're only, what, like 50 now?

Max, I really wanted to sing tonight.

Fine.

Earl, wake up.

Damn it.

Have I been living on the subway again?

No. Caroline needs you to play.

Oh, I don't think I could
sing on the subway.

"God Bless the Child" in a G.

Caroline, you're not really
gonna sing the blues.

I mean, that music's about suffering,

the pain of losing everything.

How would a girl like

[cash register bell dings]

Welcome to the Williamsburg Diner.

Your lifespan just decreased by one meal.

Would you like to order now or
after that galaxy is destroyed?

Oh, dude, I can hold up one finger, too,

and trust me; it won't be that one.

Booth one is all yours.

If I wanted to deal with a guy

who won't even acknowledge my existence,

I'd track down my father.

Makeup needs to
complement the personality.

Sorry, I wasn't listening.

Mr. Eye Queen's about to show
me how to pluck my eyebrows.

Finally.

I've been telling you for a
year you need to get plucked.

Pick up. Fried egg over easy.

Correction: make that over hard.

Max, that's Earl's order.

Can you?

You know, I could just check out

and phone in this job, too,

but I promised myself

I'd never grow up to be my gynecologist.

Earl, I know you remember a time

where people still made eye contact

and get the fact that I
was totally dissing them.

It's a damn shame, Max.

Thank you, Earl.

The Mets are down in
the bottom of the sixth.

Now you have one?

Earl, three months ago,

you thought T-Mobile was a rapper.

Max, I want to talk to you.

Well, why not?

Everyone else is listening

to something tiny and made in Asia.

I just heard the funniest joke.

A guy is driving a car up a hill
and he sees a pig in the road.

Wait. Oh yes, I forgot.

It's raining.

It's raining, and there is a pig.

I'm listening.

And then the pig is in the car...

no, the pig is in the road,

and... I'll be right back.


Thank you. Come again.

Hey, what do you want
to do after work tonight?

Maybe we could go to that
trendy new ice cream place

that only sells juice.

Nah, I'm too tired.

I've been on my feet since 2003.

Hi, can I get a red velvet...
oh, my God, Max Black?

Oh, my God, Becky White?

Holy crap. How long has it been?

Let's see. When was I on "Intervention"?

Well, your hair's grown
back on the right side,

so I'd say five years.

Hi, I'm Caroline.

I'd wait for Max to introduce me,

but she usually tells people

I'm Taylor Swift's slow cousin Randi.

Nice to meet you.

Max, I did not think
you would still be alive.

I owe you $10.

Becky's an actress.

I just saw her in "Law and Order."

She owned "deli worker who
barely knew the victim."

Yeah, I've done three "Law and Orders."

Pretty easy work.

They usually find me in a trunk.

How do you two know each other?

Max and I waited tables together.

Well, mostly stood around and got drunk,

but they paid us.

Nice shop.

Looks like you guys have
a business together too.

Too?

You two too?

We invented an Uber just for women.

Boober.

It would've been awesome,

except we didn't have an app... or a car.

Hey, forget about this cupcake.

I just got paid.

How about drinks on me?

And by drinks, I mean one PBR each.

I guess I could do drinks.

Do you mind closing up? Thanks.

I'll meet you out front.

Awesome.

Nice meeting you, Brandi.

It's Randi!

Hey, Earl, what's shaking?

Max, I'm pushing 80.

The easier question is,
"What isn't shaking?"

Max, where were you last night?

I had to watch "Carson Daly" alone and say,

"This show's still on?" to no one.

I crashed on Becky's couch,

of which... you're not
gonna believe this...

she is the first owner.

So did you guys have fun last night,

or was it weird because you've grown apart?

Let's just say we're gonna be in not one,

but two wedding albums.

Becky can dance her some hora.

Fun.

That's so fun that you had fun.

Uh, what's happening here?

I guess I just thought we were...

Forget it.

Oh, no, please.

It's like watching a bird fly into a window

in slow motion.

Well, you know, I
thought we were exclusive,

for lack of a better word.

What, like monogamous?

You thought we were in
a monogamous friendship?

I'm not even monogamous with
the people I'm monogamous with.

What is the big deal?

You had friends before we were friends.

Bunch of rich bitches.

You guys talking about
that show, "Friends"?

People always say, "Why
was there no black friend?"

Because no reasonable black man

would hang out with those people.

He's been waiting to get that off his chest

since the mid-'90s.

You know what I just realized?

I've never tried to make
friends as a not-rich person.

You made friends with me.

Against my will, but still.

Guess what I'm doing?

Motivating me to look at
resumes on monster.com?

I'm gonna make a friend right now.

There's a girl in my section
with clean-ish looking hair.

Speaking of hair, pick up.

Cobb salad.

Max, how's this for
my friend-making smile?

Do you have more teeth than me?

Here's you salad. Dressing on the side.

I'm sort of a "DOS" gal myself.

Okay.

Thanks.

Maybe we should, I don't know,
grab a couple salads sometime.

The Yelp review specifically said

I would be ignored by the waitstaff.

There's hair in your salad.

Excuse me.

The water's supposed to be that color.

No, no.

I just think it's cool how brave you were

to put yourself out there like that.

I haven't been called cool
since I had a black card

and owned 3/4 of an island.

I'm Rachel. This is Kathy.

I'm Caroline,

and you have no idea how brave I am.

You should see where I shower.

She should come to our party.

She just moved to Williamsburg,

and we're having a party tomorrow.

- You should come.
- Oh, you know what?

I'm busy tomorrow night
because I'm going to your party!

I've seen people with podcasts
less desperate for approval.

Max, I had the most amazing night.

Me too. Becky just left.

She has to get up early tomorrow.

Not to brag, but she's
playing a dead hooker

on "Blue Bloods."

Oh, so she came here for research.

Anyways, my new friends Rachel and Kathy

and everybody there were
so warm and positive.

Uh-huh.

It was so refreshing to be around people

who were super driven and focused.

Uh-huh.

And we had such interesting conversations.

Honestly, after talking to them,

I felt like anything is possible.

Oh, you guys did molly?

Now I'm jealous.

These people don't need drugs to be happy.

Oh, so it's a cult.

How did you get cult from that?

You think the only way I can make friends

is by joining a cult?

No.

You could also always have gum.

In fact, they're so nice,

they invited you to come for the weekend.

- Uh-uh.
- Fresh country air.

- No thanks.
- Gorgeous views.

- Not for me.
- Free food and booze.

I could be in a cult for the weekend.

This place is amazing.

I know. Fancy.

And that was the first bus I've been on

where I didn't see an
under-the-blanket handy.

I'm Topher. From the bus.

You were throwing
sunflower seeds in my hair.

This is Lady Marmalade.

People named Topher shouldn't be allowed

to name other living things.

Please don't make fun of her.

She has seasonal depression.

We both do.

Hey, Caroline, I'm so glad you could come.

And you must be...

Starving.

Just give me the tray.

This is Max.

Thank you so much for inviting us.

Yeah, the last invitation we
got was to audition for porn.

Less of an invitation;

more of a shout from a convertible.

"You girls want to do porn?"

Well, Elaine will be out in a minute,

so in the meantime, just
be your awesome self.

Isn't she great?

So see? It's nice here.

And you thought it was a cult.

I also thought peanuts never
touched the eggs at the diner,

but then that lady died.

Welcome, everyone.

Hi, Elaine.

There are only two rules in this house:

love one another

and don't talk to the neighbors.

I hate them.

I'm so glad you all could make it.

Oh, except Jerry.

He's getting Lasik.

He should've listened. I
told him to eat more kale.

Kale is good for the eyes.

Okay.

Now make yourselves at home.

You mean don't pay our rent

and hide every time we
hear someone in the hall?

Elaine, this is Caroline,

our new friend.

Hello, Caroline.

I've heard so many wonderful things.

And you are?

Looking for some dipping sauces.

I'm Max.

A lady who knows what
she wants. I like that.

My ex-husband knew what he wanted:

to be a woman.

And now he is.

I miss her.

And all my shoes.

I hear you, sister.

But seriously, something
like a honey mustard

or really anything in the Dijon world.

Whoo, she's a tough nut.

My favorite kind.

Except for cashews.

Max, Elaine is amazing.

Look around.

This is my new social circle.

This is the saddest circle I've seen

since my mom peed on
the floor at Wal-Mart.

Can you just admit it's not a cult?

Everyone gather 'round.

Let's have some mutual eye contact.

That's nice. That's just being a person.

Look to the person next to you,

and open the door to them with your eyes.

Bitch, that door is locked.

Nicely done.

All right, everyone.

I'd like us to recite our mantra.

My best is my best, and
that's why I'm blessed.

My best is my best,

and that's why I'm blessed.

Don't mumble, Connie.

My best is my best,

and that's why I'm blessed.

Okay, it's a cult.

Little bit.

My best is my best,

and that's why I'm blessed.

All right, everyone.

Let the sound of the bowls wash over you,

cleansing you from head to toe

and everywhere in-between.

These bowls got their
work cut out for them.

Everyone, close your
eyes and quiet the mind,

and receive the healing vibrations.

Sound bathe us, Eugene.

When you feel called to join the bowls,

begin with a soft...

I usually begin with a soft hummer.

How are we gonna

get out of this?

Let's just call it what it is:

a cult.

I'm not going anywhere

until I see what's in those bowls.

I'm hoping for fettuccini.

I hope it's not fettuccini

because I really don't
like cream-based sauces.

Do you mind?

This is important for Lady Marmalade.

She has fibromyalgia.

Fibromyalgia and seasonal depression?

You really won the dog lottery.

All right, everyone.

You may gently bring your energy

back into the room

whenever you feel ready.

We got to get out of here.

What are we gonna do? We're
in the middle of nowhere.

You know what would save the day right now?

Boober.

- Caroline.
- Hmm?

Did anything come up for
you during the sound bath?

A little bit of the
chicken satay, but all good.

Max, how are you?

Were you touched at all?

In high school, I was touched by an angel.

Well, technically, his name was...

Angel.

Oh-ho.

I know this probably all
seems like a lot of hooey,

but I assure you you'll
wake up feeling refreshed.

And Eugene makes a hell
of a pancake breakfast.

He uses ricotta.

We're staying.

I mean, ricotta? We gotta.

I guess so.

It'll be like staying at a B and B

run by a lame Ron Hubbard.

Goodnight, everyone.

Rachel has your room assignments.

Caroline, you're sharing a room with me.

Yay.

Max, you're sharing a room
with Topher and Lady Marmalade.

Can I ever get a good roommate?

And do not fear.

Before the night is over,
each of you will have a chance

to make love with me.

And the rest of the satay just came up.

Before the sunrise, our moons will unite.

Well, I'm guessing her moon's not waxed.

Caroline.

Caroline.

Caroline, where are you?

Caroline?

I thought you were gonna be Elaine...

and I'm not drunk enough for that!

By the way, the piglet's
popping the snout out.

Oh, I thought you were gonna be Elaine.

And I thought I was gonna be dead at 14,

but you can't always get what you want.

Max!

Max, oh, my God. Are you okay?

Please tell me Elaine didn't get to you.

I could never live with myself.

Or you.

I'm sorry it took me so long to climax.

I know I was almost
there for quite some time.

Max, Caroline, what are you doing out here?

We were just anxiously awaiting

intercourse with you.

Really?

'Cause unless that bag's
full of marital aids,

it looks like you're trying to sneak out.

Look, Elaine,

this is all a lot, and no offense,

but you can't be the first person

I have sex with this year.

I understand that you're both
feeling a little overwhelmed,

but before you go, why don't
we discuss this as a group

in a healing way?

All right, Eugene, stay where you are.

You need some rest.

Maybe a little protein.

So you know what? We're just gonna go.

You can tell that guy at the door

he can just step aside so we can, you know,

start running.

Caroline, you are free to go at any time.

So we can go right now?

No.

Caroline, why don't you
sit here, and Rachel,

bring Max over by the gong.

Siri, remind me to patent a gong bong.

Also remind me to get a phone with Siri.

Now, I know some of you have
not yet laid with me tonight...

But it's come to my attention

that we have an N.N. in our midst.

- What?
- Who?

Quick Q on the N.N.

Do either of those NS stand for nachos?

N.N. stands for Negative Nelly.

Negative Nancy was already trademarked

by another group run
by my ex-husband, Nancy.

Caroline, do you have any
idea who this N.N. could be?

I believe it's "whom" and no, I don't.

Caroline, are you where
you want to be in life?

Oh, God, no.

And would you say there's
someone holding you back?

Well, I do feel like

hearing about Amy Schumer every day

makes me feel a little "less than."

Caroline, is there someone in this room

who you brought with brown hair

whose Negative Nelly-ness

is blocking you in ways
you don't even realize?

Wait a minute.

I'm starting to think this is about me.

Just having spent a
few short hours with Max

and recording all your conversations...

It's pretty clear

that she is undermining
your path to success

with her wisecracks and wordplay.

Look.

Max might seem negative, because she is,

but you would be, too, if you were her.

She's been neglected, rejected,
knocked down, and spat on.

Some of that was consensual.

See?

That was positive.

So you will give up all
these potential connections

just for her?

Caroline, I used to live in Jersey City,

and now I live in a
better part of New Jersey.

Elaine, I thought I
needed to make new friends,

and that's how I wound up here,

but turns out all I needed was Max.

I'll take my chances with her.

Huge mistake.

Huge.

Well, then you're free to go.

Just need to settle up your bill.

This weekend is only free for friends.

Rachel.

I ate $700 worth of shrimp?

That seems about right.

We can't pay that.

Is there a ship we can scrub?

Or a gay celebrity we can marry?

Don't worry. I'll settle up with Elaine.

Do you accept nature's credit card?

Get out.

I can't believe the
only way I can make a friend

is to join a cult.

Well, you made friends
with me, and I'm not in a cult...

anymore.

Max, are you and I
gonna be like you and Becky someday?

Not unless one of
us gets really, really,

I mean, so much cooler.

I'm serious.

Am I gonna be just some
waitress you used to know?

'Cause that would kill me.

I don't think of you that way at all.

- Aww.
- I mean as a waitress.

Look, yes, Becky and I worked together,

and yes, we had kind of
a business dream, too,

but you and I have so much more than that.

You and I are about to die in the woods.

Look.

We are getting in that car

even if this guy has a hook for a hand.

Wazzup?

Hey, girls.

I never thought
I'd be happy to see Oleg

on a dark road at night.

Sophie, what are you guys doing here?

Oh, well, Max texted me her location.

Said if I didn't hear back from her,

you'd been abducted by the
cult and to come rescue you.

I was in a cult once.

It's called Avon.

So you were so certain I
couldn't make a normal friend

you had an escape plan?

Hey, sometimes my negativity pays off.

Sometimes it gets me in mall jail.


Happy St. Patrick's day!

Guinness and Irish cream
cupcakes for everyone!

Enjoy your blackout!

These are the last 12 cupcakes.

Actually, two of them are just
potatoes from the diner.

At some point I started putting
green icing on anything I could find.

Max, we haven't been so busy

since someone spray-painted free
sex stuff on the wall outside.

And you said
I'm not good at marketing.

Happy St. Patrick's day.

Bridget, Patrick, John, Mary,

and you, the little one,
come over here.

We're here to pick up our order.

Huh. Should be here
to pick up birth control.

Coming right up.

Max, I know I told you
I hated St. Patrick's day

because the only people
who go out are drunk trash...

We prefer to be called
"intoxicated garbage."

But that was before I knew
that drunk trash carried cash.

Nobody gonna pinch me today,
'cause I got all this green.

Oh, money's involved, and all of
a sudden you're Erin go Bragh?

Or in your case,
"Erin go training bra"?

Who wants cupcakes?

Yay!

Synced and corrected by backinblack


It was so worth
being open this morning.

We can use this St. Patrick's day money
to spring for some new pillows.

Or even just pillows.

Or just go to a bar and fall
asleep on a couple of fat guys.

Okay, how much did we make?
Show me the money.

$351!

Show me the rest of the money.

Fine, I took $3.

That's it?

Fine, I took 5.

Can't a bitch get a foot-long?

But we worked so hard.

I have so much green
under my fingernails

it looks like I had
really good sex with shrek.

What other kind
could you have with him?

Green guys make black guys
look like white guys.

I love St. Patrick's day.

Tell me one good thing about it.

Top o' the mornin'!

Look, it's a Lepre-Han.

So what do you think?

I'm concerned. If you're out here,

Who's guarding your lucky charms?

You laugh now,
and probably all night long,

but with this costume

my chances of getting laid
are higher than ever.

So zero?

Nope, 100%.

What makes you so confident?

'cause the only answer
I can think of right now

is that you have cocaine
in your wee pocket.

Hey, I can see it.

You're out drunk on St. Patrick's day,

And it seems like a good idea
to bang a Leprechaun.

Like the Presidents' Day
I hooked up with a guy

dressed like uncle sam
at the used car lot.

This costume is my ace in the hole.

Well, it does make you
look like an ace hole.

Nice outfit, Han.

You look like a pimp
I used to use in Vietnam.

Come on, let's hit the parade.

Look, Oleg, this is America.

You could have an accent
or a suspicious package,

but you can't have both.

Relax.
It's just my inventory.

I'm gonna sell t-shirts.

That is revolting.

Put me down for five.

You might also be interested
in my other choice product.

Pee funnels.

I might also not be
interested in that product.

It's a disposable funnel
for upwardly mobile, elegant,

Young ladies who want to stand
and pee in the street like a man.

I mean, have you seen
those parade port-a-potties?

Seen 'em?
I was conceived in one.

Just slip one of these
babies into your pants

And go pee in the park,
no muss, no fuss.

Well, a little muss, some fuss.

And possibly a very
unpleasant paper cut.

That's revolting.

Put me down for five.

Better make it six,
'cause if it's for ladies,

Han's definitely gonna need one.

Max, barhopping
with a horny Leprechaun

And a pee funnel salesman?

Not exactly my scene.

Can't you just go with Deke?

This is boyfriend stuff,
meaning he's gross like you.

I know, but he's snowboarding
somewhere called vail

with something called a family.

Here, we gotta lay down
a layer of grease

to absorb all the booze
we'll be drinking tonight.

This'll hold us over
till our 3:00 a.m. street meet,

Which'll hold us over till our

noon-30 rooty-tooty
fresh and fruity breakfast.

Come on, start layering.

I miss my old St. Patrick's day
tradition.

Wanna hear it?

Hell, no.

Well, from 16 to 21,
my friends and I...

Boys were there too,

Even though technically
they weren't allowed...

By 16, I was thrice divorced

and a member of the
electricians' union, but go on.

We'd rent a big suite at the
plaza overlooking the parade,

And we'd fill balloons
with champagne and...

And throw them
down at the parade crowd!

So fun, right?

Oh, wait, that was you guys?

One year you hit me
and my friend archie.

He sells car seat covers
in Rhode Island now.

He's doing pretty well.

Max, why are you

dragging ass on the night
I'm supposed to get some?

Stop talking about sex
wearing that body. It's gross.

We've been stuck in traffic
for, like, an hour.

I could've had
37 Guinnesses by now.

And broken the Guinness World Record
for most Guinnesses.

Is this cab even moving?

Is that a new McDonald's
or the same one?

It's the same one,

Unless that bum's on a
masturbation tour of Manhattan.

Come on! Make 'em move!
Hit the horn again!

If you touch my horn again,
I cut your hand off!

Okay, big shot.

Do it. Do it, if it'll
get us there faster.

Look, I know I said I'd
spring for a cab, but it's $70!

And I'm gonna need that
for a junior king room

At the holiday inn express!

Don't worry, Han, we'll chip in.

No, we won't. We need that $356.
That's all we made today.

It has to last till we're 82.
This is our funeral money, Max.

Don't worry, we'll make more money.

Not much more, but a little bit.

Damn it!

I can hear
the bagpipers coming this way.

They're playing closing time.
That means the parade's over.

Now I'm never gonna
sell the pee funnels.

All right, I gotta move some t-shirts.

Heads up, peoples!

"Kiss me I'm Irish"
crotch tees. $15.

Or two for 25! Five for 60!

You nobody!

You can't sell those out the window.

That's illegal.
You need a permit!

Just drive, grandma.

I can't believe
you call yourself Russian.

Doesn't seem like
you're rushin' anywhere.

You say that again, and I'll
cut your tongue out!

Oh, now you're gonna
cut out my tongue?

Why do you want to punish all
the women in the tri-state area?

Look, oh, my God, it's Earl!

Earl, what're you doing here?

Hey, y'all!

This is my bagpipe group Black Irish.

I'm black, they're Irish.

Why didn't you tell us
you were coming to the parade?

Well, I kinda like to keep
my skirt wearing on the D.L.

When did you learn
how to play bagpipes?

I do not know.

I took too much acid once,
and, when the trip ended,

I could play the bagpipes
and drive a stick.

I'll catch up with you at Blarney's.

Han, pay the man.

It's ten blocks away.
We can walk.

In these shoes?

Ugh, green beer.

Is this really how
we honor the Irish,

Some of our greatest
writers and poets?

Oh, did they come up with,

"If you sprinkle when you tinkle,

be a sweetie, wipe the seatie"?

First of all, not a real poem.

And as the person
who shares your bathroom,

Maybe take that advice.

Maybe take that frown
and get it drunk.

Okay, sure, we're two
young girls on the town

On what's probably America's
most dangerous holiday.

Why... why have our wits about us?

That's the spirit.

And who knows? Maybe you'll
meet a cute, Irish guy.

Happy St. Paddy's day!

Blarney Bill.

Are you the owner of this
colorful establishment?

I'm not even
the owner of these pants.

Where's me kiss?

Blarney bill is like
the mascot of this place.

Every year I kiss him for good luck.

And when does that luck kick in?

Where's me kiss?

I left it in me other purse?

Wow. That's a wet moustache.

Scotch and fish.

What?

That's why it's wet!

Man, he's the best.

The best what?

Hey, girls!

Sold my last shirt.

Hey, told you that small would fit.

Look at han at that table
with all those...

I want to say "girls..."

waiting to take pictures with him.

Mm, Becca!

Be-becca!

Over here.

Oh, no, you're not Becca.

Hey, though.

Are you guys in line to take
pictures with the Leprechaun?

No.
$5.

Wait, what?

Ah, yes, we are the Leprechaun's
McAgent and McManager.

It'll be $5 to take
a selfie with the Leprechaun.

That is a great deal.

Max, I am not doing this.

Fine. Then we'll have to use the
cupcake money for our cab home.

Okay, that there is virgin Leprechaun.

So it's $10.

10 for a picture, 15 for a kiss,
nothing below the waist.

That's 'cause there's
nothing below the waist.

Will you take a 20?

I mean, I guess.

Just so you know, if you're
an orphan, I'm interested.

Are you over here
making money off of me,

You wolves of Wall Street?

We're just taking advantage
of drunk people.

It's a St. Paddy's tradition,

Like corned beef or punching a cop.

Well, then maybe you can get
them to take advantage of me.

Get a little handsy on hansy.

I've got my eye
on that buxom paralegal.

The one over there who
brought in outside chicken?

Hook daddy up!

So I'm going up to the woman

who brought her own
two-liter of coke to a bar

to ask her for money to touch you.

That's the gist.

What's happened to my life?
Where am I?

Blarney's!

Oh, God, it's Blarney Bill.

Hey, that's my name!

Where's me kiss?

Oh, well, I...

I have to go to the ladies' room

And wash whatever
is on my mouth and in my mouth

off my mouth
and out of my mouth.

We've been in this line so long,
now I actually have to pee.

Max, are you eating chicken?

She didn't have
10 bucks to tickle Han,

So she paid me in purse chicken.

I think I came out ahead.

Uh, sorry, back of the line.
No cuts.

Please. I'm feeling sick.

Sorry, no cuts,
no buts, no coconuts.

Is that one of those
famous Irish poems too?

I totally understand.
Yeah, I get it.

Just let her cut.
It's St. Patrick's day.

She's having fun.

Not to bring up my St. Patrick's
day tradition at the plaza...

Oh, good.

But it was so much better
than this place.

I mean, there were no lines.

We'd sit like non-animals in
the palm court and sip Bellinis.

I'm taking you to palm court

if you tell that story one more time.

Guys.

I just threw up.

And you're carrying it around
like a baby chick?

I-I think I'm gonna need some water.

I have to drive
a school bus in four hours.

You're a great American.

I know what I am.

Ahem!

Oh!

Where's me kiss?

Uh, she has it.

Ah!

Dodged a bullet.

Bullet found ya.

Come on. I have to find
another bathroom.

I'm not peeing
anywhere near Blarney Bill.

I don't want him to find "me kiss"
when I have me pants down.

I gave him your number.
Is that cool?

Oh, no. I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

You mean in life?
Yeah, me neither.

No, it's all that green beer.

And if I wet myself
here on 53rd street,

I'll be forced to abandon you,
move to the Midwest,

And start a new life.

I have a bathroom you can use.

I've hit some very
low points today,

but I'm not about to pee
through a paper penis in public.

Here, quick, just pop a squat
over here behind the float,

I'll block you so no one'll see,

And the 15 high school
marching bands'll

mask the sound of you
hitting rock bottom.

Gimme that thing.

Damn it, Max. Damn it!

How do I do this?

Well, I do have my master's
in public urination from Devry.

Just unzip,
put it in your pants,

and let a river run through it.

No one's looking, right?

Nope.

Hi, Caroline.

Sophie, you were in the parade?

Of course I was.

You can't be a volunteer firefighter

without being in the parade.

You're a volunteer firefighter?

Well, I do go down
to the station voluntarily.

Besides, every
fire station needs a pole,

And I'm it, baby.

Anyway, we're all going to Blarney's.

Shots on me.

And by that I mean shots on me.

Come on.

When the firemen's pole
offers you drinks, you say yes.

Max, I am not going back in there.

In fact, I'm treating you
to a drink at the plaza.

You know that money we were
saving for our funeral?

That's no longer an issue
because I just died right then.

Rest in pee, Caroline.

Look, Max, our Bellinis.

Thank you, Claude.

He's a plaza institution.

And I just remembered
his name is Rolph.

You forgot the name rolph

After we just saw
a girl do that in her hands?

Isn't it lovely here?

Less Blarney's, more Barney's.

And trust me,
these Bellinis are famous.

Why?
Did they make a sex tape?

Ooh, kind of tastes like the time

I put canned peaches
in my boxed wine.

Max, a plaza Bellini
is a far cry from boxed wine.

Well, my rule is, if I have
to refrigerate it, it's fancy.

I'm talkin' to you, batteries.

You know, tonight is really bringing up

How much I miss the old me.

Yeah, tonight is really bringing up
how much I miss my friend Archie.

Who?

The guy you hit
with the champagne balloons.

Sells car seat covers in Rhode Island.

You know how I said
he was doing really well?

Truth is I haven't talked
to him in a year.

Really dropped the ball.

And the most exciting thing
about this place...

Those elevator doors
can open,

and you never know
who's gonna step off.

Max, this is nice.

Max, this is boring.
What happened?

Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

Now I'm thinking maybe this wasn't
as much fun as I thought it was.

Now I'm thinking Archie's dead.

'Cause I feel like I got
a text about it and ignored it.

Even this Bellini
doesn't taste as good.

I knew it, my taste buds
must have committed suicide

after my first 7-Eleven sushi.

I mean, nothing is the same.

Why did I think this was fun?

Because before you met me,
you didn't know what fun was.

I get your point, Max,

But I did own a Caribbean Island
with six jet skis.

Oh, come on, get over it.
Drink up. It's not that bad.

Can you just let me feel sad?

No!
Not on St. Patrick's day.

You have a good time, and you
don't think about your problems.

That girl who threw up in her hands,

She didn't sit around saying,
"Eh, meh, my life sucks."

No, she threw her hands in the air,

Hit a lot of people with the vomit,

and kept the party going.

Yeah, the party was
all over everybody's shoes.

Look, it doesn't matter
that this is literally

the stupidest place I've ever
been in my whole frickin' life.

Let's get another $40 Roberto Benigni

and keep our party going.

Come on, let's go.
There's no party here.

There may be a $3 million
bat mitzvah happening upstairs,

but there's no party here.

But I do know where there is one.

We'll just take the check, Rolph.

And I just remembered
his name is Dennis.

Max, I'm sorry if I rained
on your parade today.

Well, peed on it.

Don't worry about it.

Everything that means
something to me gets peed on.

Hey, girls!
I heard you left!

You missed me winning
the hula-hooping contest.

When did you learn how to hula-hoop?

Once again, I do not know.

You're still rocking
the bagpipe ensemble.

I thought you wanted to keep
your skirt wearing on the low-low.

That was before I discovered
the sensation

of a cool breeze circling
my bag and my pipe.

Hey! Max, Caroline!

Excuse me, move it.
Move it. Move it.

Hey, move it.
Wanna break my big-ass clover?

Girls, where did you go?

We went to the plaza,
and I realized my life

may actually be richer now
than when I was rich.

Oh, no. Is it too late to walk away?

Can you girls loan me some cash?

I met a girl, and I need
money for the bus

back from her sister's condo
in Jersey City.

She said we've got to be quiet,
but I make no promises.

Sure. I gotcha, Han.
What do you need, a 20?

Oh, what the hell? Take 50.
We can always make more.

Or not.

Look at you throwing the cash around.

You know, girl, there might
be hope for you yet.

Jeanine, I'm good to go.

Told you, girls. 100%.

Looks like they're both
gonna get unlucky tonight.

Hey, Max, Caroline, over here!

I save ya a couple of seats.

And a couple of firemen.

Uh, there's no place to sit.

Oh, you are so green.

'Sup?

Happy St. Paddy's day!
Where's me kiss?

Oh...

Mm...

Scotch and fish!

(rock music)

Han, what're you doing
in our bar?

You know we can't serve kids.

Or did you just want to see

what a successful
business looks like?

I know what a successful
business looks like.

My cousin runs a Blimpie's
in Queens.

You have a relative
that works at a Blimpie's?

(gasps) Is he single?

Hi, I'm Clint,
the new bartender.

It's a pleasure for you
to meet me.

I hired Clint away from that
cool bar down the street.

He has a following.

And his following
followed him here,

and now we have a following.

You following?

Oh, a following.

Like I had on YouTube before
they got all weird about nudity.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Wow.

Girls, this place
has more people in it

than my first marriage.

Hey, Earl.

Cacao Storm for my
diabetic dreamboat?

Well, you know
I can't say no to booze.

If I could, I'd still be
in The Temptations.

No, no, no,
it's very little booze, okay?

CLINT: See, you drink it
for the raw cacao.

Yeah, it releases serotonin
and boosts your energy

and your mood.

I'm pretty much a genius.

And I'm pretty much
gonna pass.

You want to try a Cacao Storm?
Huh, buddy?

Yeah, you do.

They're addictive.

Raw cacao with a little
chocolate liqueur.

It's how I got to be
such a big deal.

And it's how I'm gonna get
a new wardrobe

with the way
these are selling.

Soon, I'll be able to
buy clothes from places

that don't also sell gas.

I'll try one.
I am a little stressed.

I'm entering the post office's

Federal Duck Stamp Contest
this year.

They still have
post offices?

I wonder if my "wanted"
poster's still up.

It is.
You were a cute kid.

And they have a contest
to design

a new duck stamp every year.

If I win, my mallard drawing
will be on

official United States postage.

How can there be a winner
of a contest

you have to be a loser
to enter?

You feeling the buzz yet, son?

You should.
I only use pure Columbian cacao.

Strongest in the city--
actually, in the state.

I just didn't want
to brag about it.

It's one of the greatest
things about me.

Oh!

Yes, yes.

I think I feel it.
A little jolt.

Wasn't that your
 American Gladiator name?

Why you got to harsh my buzz?

Wait till this duck flies
to stamp victory.

Then I'll be ridicule-proof.

You'll never be
wedgie-proof.

I just checked our receipts.

We already made
$1,500 tonight.

Max, if this keeps up,
we'll be able

to watch Hulu
without commercials.

$1,500 in one night?

I didn't even make that much

when I turned in my mom
for the reward money.

Plus, it think this is better
than you bartending, Max.

You were great, but your "one
for them, one for me" policy

got a little topless.

You enjoyed the tips,
didn't you?

I said "Tips."

SOPHIE: Excuse me, excuse me.

Haven't you seen a stroller
in a bar before?

Hey, girls.

What, you're not even
gonna say hello,

'cause I look like garbage?

You didn't even give us
a chance, Sophie.

You were too busy running over
all of our customers.

Well, I'm sorry if I'm
embarrassing you

with the way I look,
Caroline.

Look, I don't have time to make
me and baby Barbara look sexy.

Max, maybe we should
get manicures?

I haven't had one since
Gwyneth Paltrow

was only a little annoying.

We don't have grooming money.

I'm still cutting my hair
with a sword like Mulan.

Max, we're doing really well,

so why not enjoy
our success a little?

I mean, we don't have
"screw you" money yet,

but we have enough to be
mildly unpleasant.

(laughs) No kiddin'!

*

Oh, come on, come on!

I want to get our nails did.

Why does it take so long
for a load to finish?

Have you tried dirty talk?

(machine buzzes)

Oh, that's my dryer.

Oh, mine now.

You snooze, you lose.

But I wasn't snoozing,
why am I losing?

'Sup, Janice?

How's things down at
the Coinstar?

Ugh!

Where's my underwear?

Looks like Ralph
has a job interview.

Ralph, that's my underwear.

Give it back.

Ugh, I can't wait till we don't
have to come here anymore.

But where will we
cook our chicken?

You know what?

We're successful now.

We don't have to
come here anymore.

Can I have your
attention, everyone?

Uh, that depends,
are you a cat video?

I'd like to make
an announcement.

our own washer and dryer.

Or more realistically,
a low-budget fluff-and-fold.

So take one last look at us--

But no need to take out
your penis, Marty.

Come on, Max,
let's go get our manicures.

Good-bye, Laundromat,
we are never coming back

to this hell hole again.

You just put another
load in the washer.

We are coming back
to this hell hole again.

Earl, we got manicures!

Caroline wanted our nails
to project success, so...

What says "classy lady"
like Monopoly houses?

Wow, congratulations, Max.

This is probably the closest
any of us will ever come

to owning a house.

Speak for yourself, Earl.

Max and I are successful now.

I said good-bye to the
Laundromat this morning,

and this afternoon, I said
good-bye to the bodega

where we get our flu shots.

You could've waited
till after I got my

flu shot and sandwich combo.

Hi, could you bring me
a water, please?

Um, could you
bring someone water

if you had houses for fingers?

I can't wait till we say
good-bye to this place.

I'm gonna be really mean.

I may do it as a poem.

What rhymes with
"rat-infested"?

Flat-chested.

You better slow down.

We've only had one good night
at the dessert bar,

and you said we had to keep
working at the diner

till we made enough
to be legally poor.

Han, your hair!

Who are you supposed to be,
Edward Scissor-hans?

I was up all night,
sketching my stamp.

Want to see my duck?

Praying that wasn't
an auto-correct.

Look at all the
practice ducks I've drawn.

The Harlequin duck.

The Spot-Billed duck.

A mallard.

No, a mallard!

Where'd you get that
cacao from?

Clint gave me a couple grams
before he left last night.

I've been micro-dosing it
all day.

Why are you rubbing it
on your gums?

Are you teething?

Clint says the buzz is stronger
if I take it straight.

Okay, I didn't believe Clint
when he said cacao

was addictive, but I also didn't
believe in leprechauns

until I started
working for one.

If I cut my gums...

Will it enter my bloodstream
any faster?

You're a junkie!

Han, you're acting like that
time you had a whole Red Bull.

Okay...

you have a problem!

I'm telling Clint
you're cut off.

Well, I'm telling Clint
I love him.

He loves that.

Fine, I'll just finish
my stamp without cacao.

Damn it!

Hi, everybody!

I hope they're never
expecting Barbara

to have a
short-term memory.

Oh, look away,
look away.

Things have gotten real bad.

Yeah.

I look like
all of you now.

Sophie, why didn't you
come with us to the nail place?

It was so much fun.

I couldn't make it,
I was too busy

bedazzling
Barbara's diapers.

I'm just gonna
have to face it--

I'm not gonna be pretty again
for at least 12 years.

Oh, I'll be Caroline's age
by then.

Caroline, if pity boners
are a thing,

you have got to
get back out there.

I was thinking the same thing.

*

Psst! Psst!

You got the stuff, Clint?

It's premium grade, right?

If it isn't,
you're in for a very

unpleasant conversation.

My guy from Columbia
guarantees it.

Not the country,
we went to college together.

Want a little taste?

You bet your butt I do!

I want to make sure
it's not cut with Nestle Quik.

Oh.

That's the stuff
muddy donkeys are made of.

HAN: Max!

Uh, fancy meeting you here.

Clint and I were just
bro-ing out over sports.

And breasts.

And...zoos?

What do men talk about?

Hey, Max.

We killed it last night, huh?

Me more than you.

You gonna want this or not,
I got to go do my podcast.

I'm interviewing myself.

I know a drug deal
when I see it!

He's cut off.

Like me on
$2 margarita night.

Max, I need that cacao
to finish my duck stamp!

One last ride
on the chocolate pony.

Look at you--
chocolate all over your face.

You look like Jonah Hill reading
the reviews for War Dogs.

Clint, don't you dare
sell it to him.

You can't tell me
what to do, okay?

You're talking to someone who
watched the second season

of True Detective.

Right, Han?

That scumbag couldn't have taken
all the cacao.

Quick, help me check
the cabinets.

Keep away from
my drawers, Han.

You got to be used to
hearing that.

Max, I just gave
a good-bye speech

at the free clinic.

Oh, also,
the lab technician

said for you to
call her ASAP.

Ugh, Claire freaks out
about everything.

I'll tear this place apart!

Where the hell is the cacao?

What's happening,
where's Clint?

-He quit.
-He quit?

But what about his following?

What about our following?

What about my good-bye tour?

-Say good-bye to it.
-(gasps)

(gasps) I think I found some!

Nope, that was
straight-up dirt.

It's for the best.

'Cause Jane Cacaoski over there
can't get enough.

I'll just get back
behind the bar.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
one of my hotels came loose

Han, if you can
get that cacao,

Max can make
the Cacao Storms herself.

I've seen her make opium out of
poppy seed bagels and a Lacroix.

Han, call that dealer.

Already dialing.

I'm halfway down
the Hershey Highway.

I meant the Fudge Factory.

I don't want to hear about
your personal life,

just call the dealer.

Han, where is this guy?

I'm scared.

Someone might think
we're a couple.

I hope he gets here soon.

I just snorted a pint
of Chunky Monkey.

That's him, now act cool.

Yoo-hoo, Mr. Drug Dealer!

Right here.

You're embarrassing me!

Oh, also,
tell him we're not a couple.

You guys here for the cacao?

Let's cut to the chase,
where's the dope?

Standing right
in front of me.

-We're not together.
-Shh!

You want the cops
to hear us?

Would it matter?
You're selling chocolate.

I know, but it's more fun
to act like it's naughty.

That's the only reason
I do this.

I'm so bored.

I'm a stay-at-home grandpa.

Show me the skrank!

That's the word I made up
for street cacao.

Here it is.

Had to kill a hooker
to get it.

(gasps)

I wish.

My daughter-in-law
works for Nestle.

EARL: Ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah.

Earl, what're you doing
out here?

Just to be clear,
I'm out here with Han

for business,
nothing romantic.

What are you doing out here

with my Canadian Viagra
connection?

-Hey, Earl!
-Hey, Bill!

Hey, man, how's your
daughter-in-law?

Still climbing the corporate
ladder at Nestle Toronto?

And doing CrossFit
on the weekends.

Uh-huh.

And Ted's finally got
his real estate license.

-Oh--
-No one cares, Grandpa!

Tell that to the pigeons
in the park!

I'm this close to
main-lining Tootsie Rolls.

-Here's the money.
-Not this again!

I come out here
to smoke a joint,

and I walk in
on a drug deal?

Shame!

Hey, you!

Get out of here before I
pop a cap in your Honda Odyssey.

I'm sorry, it was either this,
or have an affair.

And I'm just too tired.

Well, it looks like
I got to go tell Ruth

it's gonna be an
"everything but" kind of night

Jeez.

I learned it from
watching you, Dad?

Max, we need that cacao
for our dessert bar.

I already told
the soup kitchen what I think

of their tomato bisque,
so there's no turning back.

Your addictions
are both out of control.

Caroline, there are no
shortcuts to success

or creating a
stamp-worthy mallard.

Life is a slow, steady climb
to just getting by.

Snap out of it!

Me?
You're addicted too.

To these nails.

(gasps)

No I'm not,
I can stop any time!

(laughs)

No.

Maybe a little.

(both gasp)

SOPHIE: Found it!

Sophie?

Is there anyone we know
not in this alley?

I found Barbara's bedazzler.

Oh, yeah,
it's all about her now.

Oh, you can't be gorgeous
and be a good mother.

Just look at
Neil Patrick Harris.

Well, I think he's very charming
and I think you're being unfair.

This might be what's left of my
nails talking, but Sophie,

if you're not decked out with
your boobs half showing,

are you really setting
the right example for Barbara?

Oh, from this side
of the dumpster,

you're making a lot of
sense, girl.

You really are.

Are you gonna start
brushing your teeth

and putting the seat down?

No.

Here's your flan-tini.

And here's my flan-tini.

Good to be back.

Well, I tried,
but I can't find Clint.

I feel like every man
I've ever had sex with.

We don't need Clint
or his stupid cacao.

Uh, although, his podcast
was pretty interesting.

Those girls he worked for
sounded like nightmares.

I'm gonna have one,
two, three Sprites.

We're getting wild tonight.

Coming right up,
Bill the Dealer.

Oh, it's just Bill now.

I accidentally butt-dialed my
wife during a major

Pepcid AC drop.

She took the minivan.

Hey, everybody!

No, it's not Suzanne Somers.

It's me, Sophie!

Wow, Sophie got
her sexy back.

Yeah, and front and under.

Sophie, you deserve
a flan-tini.

And so do I.

Oh, you know what,
I did what you told me to do

and I dropped baby Barbara off
at the trainer/babysitter,

and I had a bunch of Korean
ladies go to town on me.

Hey, where's Oleg?

I told him to meet me here.

Sophie?

You look as beautiful
as the day

we first did it
on the sink.

Damn straight, I do!

Yo, what's with the
white people's clothes?

Yeah, what's going on?
I can't even see any nipple.

But somehow, it's worse.

Sophie, I want you to see that
we don't have to be

the sexy couple anymore.

Anymore?

When were you guys
the sexy couple?

That weekend you went to
Amish Country?

Oh, yeah.

Do you remember when we
did it in that buggy

in front of that family?

Oh, I bet they wish they had
a camera for that.

You want to go do it
in the bathroom...

buggy-style?

Oh, I'm gonna pretend
that Jebediah

is turning away in shame.

I'm gonna pretend he isn't.

I guess we're scrubbing down
our bathroom later.

We're heading out.

It's almost 8:00.

Here's my last bag of cacao.

I can't do anything with it,

not with my cholesterol.

A tiny baggie of cacao?

What're we gonna do
with this?

Same thing I do
with any powder I find:

see what all the fuss
is about.

Mmm.

-Not hating it.
-Mm-mm. No.

(gasps)

(cash register dings)

(upbeat music)

*

Oh, you look pretty sharp tonight, Earl.

Going somewhere special?

Max, i am free black and 75.

Who knows what the night will bring?

Well, here's a twenty.

Can you break this the way you just
broke my heart?

Pop-pop.

Look at all this.

People really tipped us well tonight.

Yeah, well, don't get used to it.

Thanksgiving is almost here,
and as soon as people realize

how much money
they have to spend

on holiday gifts,
their wallets snap tighter

than Kim Kardashian's legs
after the wedding check cleared.

I've always loved
this time of year--

spiced pumpkin lattes,
bringing my winter furs out,

then bringing my winter furs

to the dry cleaner's
to get the red peta paint out.

For me, it was jumping
into a pile of leaves

and finding a used condom.

What's up,
children of the corn?

I will stay tonight
and decorate diner

for American holiday
of Thanksgiving.

Wow. I'm surprised you got
the right holiday decorations.

Last month, you put out
Easter bunnies for Yom Kippur.

So many Jewish holidays,
I cannot Wikipedia them all.

What, like I don't got a life?

My father and I had
a very special

Thanksgiving tradition
every year.

Oh, let me guess.

You'd fly someplace like
the Bahamas, lay by the pool,

and he'd light other people's
stolen money on fire?

No. We'd rent out
the Waldorf Astoria ballrooms

and feed the homeless.

Don't look at me right now.

And after, we'd fly down
to our home in St. Barts

for two weeks.

Okay, you can look at me again.

I stayed
at the Waldorf Astoria once--

For that money,
it should eat me first.

Okay, ready to go?

Han, if you'd really like
to do something in the diner

to honor the spirit
of Thanksgiving,

you can open your doors
and feed the homeless.

Yeah, put your money
where your cornstalk is.

Caroline and I
will work for free.

Isn't it enough that
when I see them on the street,

I smile and pretend
to fumble for change?

No, it isn't.

You can afford to open
the diner for one night.

You can't put a price tag on
those kind of emotional rewards.

Yes, I can.
$18 for 16-pound turkey,

and I will need many of them.

There--price tag.

Here, I will pay for turkeys.

Jeez, dude,
where'd you get that?

I sell cigarettes
from New Hampshire

to schoolkids in New York.

It is a good profit
and beautiful drive.

I love the leaves.

All right.

I'm feeling y'all.
I'll bring the pie.

My mother used to make
the best chocolate pie.

I remember one time
she got so mad

at this white woman
she worked for,

she took this chocolate pie
into the bathroom--

No, hold up.
That was from the help.

I know it's not Burberry
like we're used to,

but I'm telling you,
used moving blankets

are gonna be in this year.

Who's a trendsetter?

We're really lucky
November is so warm.

Another thing I'm giving
thanks for this Thanksgiving--

global warming.

I think the three remaining
polar bears would disagree.

Max, it's time
to teach me how to bake.

Okay, well,
if we're doing that,

first I have to go get baked.

I'm serious.

It's the beginning
of the holiday season,

and with all the potential
Christmas cupcakes

and festive gift baskets,

you're gonna need
as much help as you can get.

Festive holiday gift baskets?

No way.

I'm not into all that crap.

Oh, no. Are you gonna be
one of those,

"I am too cool to believe
in the wonders of Christmas"

type of bitches?

I am so many types of bitches,

I've lost count.

And the only wonder of Christmas
I'm aware of is...

I wonder how you're gonna
keep up that attitude

through Christmas this year.

Why, because this is my first
holiday without any money?

Uh, yeah.

Money isn't what makes

the holidays special, Max.

Uh, yeah.

The holidays
are totally about money.

It's about spending money
to buy things

to stuff into
the giant black sucking hole

in the center of each of us
that reminds us

life is hard and then we die.

And that's my Christmas card.

Max, I'm aware this holiday
season will be challenging,

will I miss my 20-foot
Christmas tree

decorated by ten gay men? Yes.

Will I miss those ten gay men

outing my cousin Steven
before he was ready? No.

My holiday spirit
is bigger than my money.

So come on,
teach me how to bake.

We only have a couple weeks.

Fine. Pour a cup of milk
into the mixer.

This will be fun.

When I was little, I used
to make my father cakes

in my easy-bake oven.

My easy-bake oven
was repossessed.

So, um, speaking of your father,
are you doing okay?

I mean, this is
a hard time of year

for people who have feelings,
and just...

With your father in prison,
how are you doing?

I'm doing great.

I actually just found out
that since it's Thanksgiving,

they're allowing me to come
see him for the first time.

Well, that excitement
will probably taper off

after the full-body
cavity search.

I don't know. I might like it.

It's been a while since
I've had any cavities searched.

All right. Pour the milk, slut.

One cup milk.

There, how's that?

Good.

Now into the mixer.

There, how was that?

Uh-uh. We're not playing

"Rich girl gets a trophy every
time she does something normal"

Just cover the bowl
with the towel

so it doesn't splash out,
and turn it on.

Oh, it's not plugged in.

Oh. Right.

No, not without the towel!

Christmas comes
but once a year,

and I think it just did.

Wow. These high-end mixers
are a lot of money.

I thought if we came
to a big department store,

there'd be a lot of them,
and the prices would be better.

We can't afford these.

How much did you
think they'd be?

I don't know.

I guess I'm not used
to looking at prices.

I usually just point,
pout, and it's purchased.

Yeah, I had a version
of that, only it was more like,

point, and when
they look the other way,

stuff steaks
down your pants and run.

Come on, there has to be
a mixer here we can afford.

There is.

Here.

A $5 spoon?
That's what we can afford?

Yeah, if we put it on layaway,
work hard for a few years.

I'm used to being poor
around your stuff,

but not around stuff
that I want.

What happened to all your
"money's not important"

holiday spirit now?

Max, it feels like you want me

to be depressed
about the holidays.

No, no. I'm just saying
that it's okay for you

not to be all up
and everything around me

if you're not feeling it.

It's all right
to let your dark side out.

Come to the dark side.

Oh, my God.

Look, they're hiring elves.

Why would I go to the dark side

when I could go to Santaworld?

Let's go get in line.
I've always loved Santaworld.

Me too,
as a David Sedaris story,

not as an actual
real-life option.

Come on.

If we get hired, we could use
our employee discount

to get one of the really
good cake mixers.

And then it'd be like
it came from Santa!

Come on, Max,
we'd be great elves.

I have the holiday spirit.
You're great with kids.

And we're both
so desperate for money,

we'll wear
other people's tights.

Max, I've been coming
to this store at Christmastime

with my father
since I was little.

I'd get all dressed up in
my fanciest winter coat and hat

and then stand
in line to see Santa

with my hands in my muff.

And they didn't throw you out?

There is nothing Christmas-y
about this hallway.

It looks like the place
Santa sends promiscuous elves

to get the results
of their S.T.D. test.

Okay, that's
the kind of comment

that almost got us knocked
out of the first round.

You're lucky
I edited your application.

Why, what was so bad?

You requested to work
in Santa's sex toy shop.

Max, that's not even a thing.

Tell that to my
candy-cane-shaped vibrator.

Max!

I call it "Santa's big helper."

Please try and get
into the holiday spirit.

I know. If we get hired,

we'll go right home and watch
Miracle on 34th Sstreet.

It'll be a miracle
on 34th Street

if we make it out of the bottom
of this slave ship

without elf scurvy.

Hi.

I couldn't help but overhear you
mention Miracle on 34th Street.

That's my absolute favorite
Christmas movie.

Mine too!

My second favorite
is it's a wonderful life.

Mine too!

I've got Schindler's List
on Blu-Ray.

- Hi. I'm Mary.
- I'm Caroline.

Hi. I'm Mary.

It's cool.
We don't need to talk.

That's Max. She's kind of
a Grinch about Christmas.

Oh, like my brother Patrick--

He's always teasing me
about loving Christmas.

He calls me "Mary Christmas."

Get it?

It's 'cause my name is Mary.

I can't help it.

It's my favorite time of year.

- Mine too.
- Yo.

Disconnect
before it's too late.

Don't be so cynical.

Especially Christmas eve.

It's an O'Brien
family tradition.

All seven of my sisters
and brothers--

we line up on the staircase
in our brand-new Christmas PJs

and have our picture taken.

Bitch is 30.

It's my father.

Hi, daddy. You'll never guess
where I am right now--

applying for a job
at Santaworld.

No, it's not depressing at all.

The man's in prison, and he
thinks this is depressing.

Oh. Are you sure?

It's really not that far.

Okay. If that's what you want.

Call me on Thanksgiving.
Love you.

He thought about it
and doesn't want me to come.

He said he can't face
having me see him in there.

- You okay?
- Fine.

Quiet, please, people.
I have an announcement.

Everyone in this corridor
has been chosen to be an elf.

Mazel.

Yay, we're elves.

Report to work at 3:00 A.M.
the morning of Black Friday.

Ooh!

This is so exciting!

♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪

Okay, well...

- I'll see you both then.
- Okay, Mary.

Great, 3:00 A.M.--

you, me,
and definitely-a-Virgin-Mary.

Good night. Get home safely.

Ooh. Maybe I should not
have said that to homeless.

That is it.

2:00 A.M.--
Freebie Thanksgiving dinner

is now officially over.

According to my calculations,

we served over
300 turkey dinners

and only had two knife fights.

Thank you, Caroline.

This experience taught me
that rich or poor,

home or homeless,
we are all the same.

Wait. Where's my wallet?

They took my wallet,
those dirty sons of--

Oh, here it is.

Yes, we are all the same.

Well, I have two things to say.

First of all,
I'm incredibly proud of us

for spreading the spirit
of Thanksgiving together.

And secondly, someone left
an adult diaper in this booth,

and I am not dealing with that.

What's with the sad face?

You saw the bathroom?

It's just--even though
we fed the homeless,

it doesn't feel like
Thanksgiving without my father.

But you made a lot
of people happy here tonight,

and you should feel
pretty good about that.

- Yes, I do.
- Come on, elf.

We better clear these tables.

We have to be at Santaland
in an hour.

Why you have to be there
in the middle of the night?

Because it's Black Friday,
and the doors open at 5:00 A.M.

Yeah, we want to be there
right on time

to see the first person
trampled to death by UGGs.

We have to work

all night and then
all day tomorrow.

- How are we gonna do this?
- I got the answer right here.

Max, I'm not doing cocaine.

If we could afford cocaine,
we could afford a mixer.

Nine-hour energy shots,
aka elf juice.

I've never done these.
Do they work?

Millions of
wired-off-their-asses

college students
can't be wrong.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Did you just drink
that whole thing?

Yeah, why?

Nothing.

I'm sure it's not too much.

They suggest sipping it, but...

Who are they?

All right, we'd better go.

We got to go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

Oh, you should've sipped it.

How do I look?

Because I kind of feel like
I look like a North Pole dancer.

You actually look cute.
You look good in red...

And green--
red and green together.

You can pull off anything.
You're so beautiful.

- I don't tell you that enough.
- Whoa!

Whoa, slow down, speed racer.

I know. I can't stop talking.

What was in that stuff
you gave me?

I don't know.
The ingredients are in Spanish.

Well, my corazon
is beating muy rapido.

Okay, and why aren't you
in your elf costume yet?

Because I was talking
to those people over there,

and there's a chance--
a slight chance, but a chance--

I could get moved to the
strolling Christmas carolers.

I overheard their ethnic mix
is short a token blond.

And I'm blond, baby!

Forget it. You got me into
the underbelly of the elf beast,

and you are not bailing on me.

But those period costumes
are so much prettier.

I will knock you from here

to Rudolph's house
if you abandon me.

We are in this together.
Now go get your bells on.

Okay, I didn't want
to tell you this

because it's, well, gross,
but the last elf

who had the tights they gave me,
well, let's just say

her little lady elf friend
visited unexpectedly.

Ew.
Talk about a period costume.

You're right. It's disgusting.

I can't do this anymore.

I'm leaving. I don't want
to do this anymore.

I feel tired and wired
at the same time.

This was an awful, awful,
awful, awful, awful idea!

All right, calm down!

Jeez, you're like
a Christmas crack monkey.

Look, we are not going
anywhere, okay?

You got me all elfed up,
and now we need these jobs.

So just go talk to someone

and tell them why you need
a new pair of tights.

I can't. It's embarrassing.

Look, either you ask her,
or you rip out the crotch

and risk showing six-year-olds
your winter wonderland.

Now I'm sad.

You, the one
with the dark hair,

- I need you to come with me.
- Where?

And is there
a drug test involved?

Change of plans.
I need for you to be Mrs. Claus.

The other one had to leave--
blamed menopause.

Menopause, please.

I had my uterus yanked out
on my lunch hour,

and I was back
at my desk by 2:00.

Follow me...

Unless, uh, you don't want
that extra $2 an hour.

Oh, no. You are not leaving
me here alone

when I'm crashing on elf juice.

If I can't be
an old-timey singer,

you can't be Mrs. Claus.

Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm throwing you

under the sled, sister.

That extra $2 an hour
will bring us closer

to the really good mixer.

And the way my life is going,
this might be my only chance

to be married to a rich guy.

I'd double-check those tights
if I were you.

Ugh.

These tights suck.

Hi. Hi, elf.

I just got assigned to the front
of the line with you.

Oh, crap.

It's me, Mary.

"Mary Christmas."
You know, like...

- My brother Patrick always says.
- Yeah, you said that.

Look at how cute
we look...Jingles!

I just named you Jingles.

Get it?
'Cause of all your bells.

Oh, listen...

Ah, this is my number-one
favorite Christmas song.

Ooh! What's your favorite
Christmas song?

Silent night. Get it?
'Cause I want you to be silent.

What's the matter with you?

You're acting like an elfhole.

Oh, hello, children!

Who's next to see
my husband, Santa?

I am so mad at you right now.

Oh-ho-ho!

Uh, hold on, children.

Mrs. Claus is just
having an issue

with one of her elf employees.

What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

You abandon me on Christmas

the day after my father
abandons me on Thanksgiving?

You have balls.

Christmas balls...

Like on Santa's tree...

Or a Hanukkah bush.

Look, I've got
my own problems, okay?

Santa is kind of hands-y.

And you leave me here
with this one

when I'm coming down
the bad side

of nine-hour energy mountain?

I don't know what's
at the bottom, but so far,

not the miracle on 34th Street
I was hoping for.

- Well, elf--
- Her name is Jingles.

One more word, Mary, seriously.

Listen, Bipolar Express,

you need to jingle
all the way up that mountain,

because all these kids
are looking at us.

Hello!

- You got your list for Santa?
- Yep. Got it right here.

Well, he's waiting for you,
so go right ahead in.

- Yay, let's go!
- Hi.

Oh, you look so pretty
in your hat and your coat.

Thank you very much.

I used to have
a coat like that.

But she gave it to a reindeer
because he was very cold.

Oh, you have your list
for Santa?

Let's see what you want.

- Ooh, a pretty doll...
- Had it.

- An easy-bake oven...
- Had it.

- A Barbie dream house.
- Oh, had that, too.

Had all those things,
and now I have nothing--

- nothing to stick in my big hole.
- Okay.

- Jingles, what are you doing?
- Tell them, Max.

No, no. I'm not Max.
I'm Mrs. Claus--

Mrs. Beyonce Claus--

and I'm married to Santa.

No, tell them
what you told me--

that it's all just stuff we buy
to stick in our big holes.

I've been married for 50 years.

I don't even think
about holes anymore.

Why is she talking
to children about holes?

- I'll get her.
- Okay.

- Caroline--
- No, Max, you were right.

They should know the truth.

Mrs. Claus, have a little,
uh, elf control.

Jingles, come into
my little house.

No, Max. They should know.

There is no
miracle on 34th Street,

and it's not such a
wonderful life.

If it were,
I wouldn't be standing here

in crotchless tights
in the middle of Santaland,

with a father in prison,
too broke to buy a mixer.

Stop it, you're gonna
ruin Christmas.

Christmas is all about money.

If you want stuff from Santa,
you got to buy it,

because there is no--

Merry Christmas!

Get her out of here now.

And you, put your
knees together!

I hope I didn't ruin Christmas

- for all those sweet children.
- No, you didn't.

All they saw was
a crotchless elf freaking out.

But "Mary Christmas"
will never recover.

They'll find her in her
studio apartment in two weeks

hung from the chimney
with care.

Well, this is all
kind of your fault.

You told me to come
to the dark side.

I just told you to get
in touch with your feelings.

I didn't think you'd turn
into Darth Caroline.

Once I went there,
I couldn't get back.

Yeah, and chugging
that elf juice didn't help.

It wasn't just the drink.

Before those presents
came crashing down on me,

reality did.

I have no money
and a father in prison

who didn't even want to see me
on Thanksgiving.

Yeah, well, there are a lot of
people way worse off than you.

Yes, your father's in prison,

but at least you have one
and you know where he is.

And you have a home and a job.

And you have a freaking horse.

So...

Happy holidays.
It is a wonderful life.

You're right. I am so lucky.

Well, since right now is the
closest to the Christmas spirit

we're probably gonna get,

Santa wanted me to give you
your Christmas present now.

It's our new mixer.

We're gonna old-school it.

Aw, you spooned me.

I feel bad.
I didn't get you anything.

Max, you got me everything.

Before you, I was living
on a subway, and now look...

I'm living near a subway.

So did you buy this?

No, it's from Santa.

Jingles, did you steal this?

Yeah.

I grabbed it
when they were throwing us out.

Wow, Caroline Channing.

You keep this up, and you won't
have to ask permission

to visit your father in prison.

But I did give $2
of our cupcake-fund money

to the Salvation Army Santa.

So God bless us, everyone!
It's a wonderful life!

It's times like this
I really miss Darth Caroline.

Hot food from a hot man.

Max, a woman in my section wants to know

if we do anything gluten-free.
What do I tell her?

Tell her she's not allergic to gluten,
she's just masking an eating disorder.

Look alive, people.
Club sandwich, burger medium,

and a shrimp salad
for the gamblin' man.

I asked for salt and pepper.

I wanted
mayonnaise and mustard.

You forgot my diet soda.

Oh, I'm sorry,
I'll be right back with--

Oh, what?

Never doubt me.

Here's my last check, Earl.

Look here, Max. That lady
just slipped me her number.

Like I need another
menopausal white woman

scratchin' at my window
like a cat in heat.

God, I love money.

I know, I'm so sorry
it broke up with you.

Look! This week's new iPad
just came out.

Spread the words.

Word.

Word!

I saw that on The Wire.

Max, three weeks in a row

you have not yet accepted my
request to be a Facebook friend.

Max?
I am talking to you.

Oh, I didn't hear you,
I have my earbuds in.

What are these?

Okay, you had to bust a move,
and get "the truth" on my ass?

Fine, let's go there.
Han,

I'm never gonna be
your Facebook friend.

Oof!
Hard to hear.

Well, I accepted you, Han.

Yes, thank you.
You make my heart sing.

Oof.
Hurt me still.

That was like watching someone
club a baby seal.

Why wouldn't you just say yes
to his friend request?

Because I never
check Facebook, why would I?

So some girl I worked
at a movie theater with in 2005

can tell me it's raining
and she's "totes bummed?"

"Han Lee has tagged you
in 25 photos?"

Want to borrow
my seal club yet?

Oh, that stings. I've lost
like 300 Facebook friends

since my father was arrested.

Well, your father's probably

made that many new friends
in prison,

so it all evens out.

Okay, ready to go?

Do we have to?

It's so hot outside.
When did heat get so hot?

Stop fighting it,
just give in to it.

I don't know why
I'm quoting a rapist.

Can't we just stay
a little bit longer?

We don't have
any A.C. at home.

I have an A.C.
you girls can use.

You have an air conditioner
that works?

Oh, it works.

That's like an A.C. that just had salami.

There's more salami
where that came from.

And my feet hurt.

Well, you gotta stop
wearing those stilts,

and get a pair of Skechers, like
normal broke-ass waitresses.

Skechers?
How dare you.

Besides,
I can't afford new shoes.

These cost $900.

Well, then that's not pain,
that's karma.

Look,
I will help you out, okay?

I know a place we can go

that has designer things
at good prices.

Like a Barney's warehouse?

Kind of.

The Goodwill?

Welcome to my place!

We're shopping at the Goodwill?

You led me to believe
we were real-shopping.

I know.

I couldn't wait to see your face
when you saw this place.

Do the face again.

I love it!

Okay, what's that smell?

It's gonna be your smell
from now on.

Now, pay attention,
I know where the good stuff is.

I know where the good stuff is.

Madison and 57th.

Follow me.

Clever bitches hide stuff
they want to come back and buy,

'cause sometimes they don't have
$3 to buy it at the time.

Who doesn't have $3?

You.

Last week
I hid a dope vintage blazer

in the back of a nightstand,
and here it is!

Six bucks, clever bitch.
Bang, bang!

All right, well, we're here.
I'm gonna make the best of it,

but first I need a basket
without a sno-cone in it.

Hey, Trish.

Not for day-to-day,
but at the country club.

You're kidding,
but you're right.

Hey, when you find something,
check the pockets for pills.

At a thrift store downtown
I found a purple one once,

and took it.
Fell asleep for eight hours.

That was my vacation that year.

Yay, shoes!

Oh, I can't believe I just said,
"yay," in Goodwill.

Look, don't freak.
Shoes can be funky,

but I have a special spray at
home that makes them like new.

Did you get it from a wizard?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God,
these Brian Atwoods were mine.

I donated these to charity,

'cause I was photographed
wearing them twice.

Okay, they were $800
when I bought them,

now they're $8?

Like me. I'm $8.

Oh, my God.

I'm $8.

I've been reduced.

I'm sorry, it just
all became so real to me.

I mean, I can't believe it.

Um, didn't you see me crying?

Lots of people cry at Goodwill.

You go to France,
you eat snails.

You come here, you cry.

That's odd,
you didn't even react.

You need to react
when people cry.

I did, I rolled my eyes.

Look, eventually, you'll learn
to do that on the inside.

Okay, well, just FYI,

when I used to cry in front of
my other girlfriends,

they'd be like,
"What you cryin' about, C-line?

"Look at you, girl,
you're fierce,

you got your glam on."

Are your girlfriends
black drag queens?

Oh, awesome strokes tee.

I went to this concert,
but I couldn't afford the shirt.

Oh, we're done with me.

I went to see them on this tour

the summer after my junior year.
It was a really warm night,

and I snuck out of the house,
and we all ma--

Ahem.
Whatever.

And what?

What, did something great happen
the night you got the t?

Look at me, does it look like
something great ever happens?

Hey, cute tee.

Had my eye on it.

I was just
bringin' my girl back to see it.

She was in the bathroom.

I had to throw up.

So hand it over.

You know the rule.

Turn the back on the rack,
you're under attack.

That's not me,
that's the law of the 'Will.

Yeah,
you better walk away.

That was intense.

Ah, just another Wednesday
at the 'Will.

You said to look in things,
right?

Max, look.
On my first try!

Ooh, slick. Whoever
hid those is gonna be pissed.

Quality check.

Fabric sturdy,
no mysterious crotch stains,

nice work, Nancy Drew.

And look, they're designer.

Summer 2009. $350.

And for me today...

$5.
That's a reduction I like.

$5!
Oh!

$5, $5, $5, $5...

$5, $5...

Hi, Maria.

How are you, Max?

I'm good, how's your mom doin'?

Good. She really appreciated
the cupcakes you made her.

Hi, Maria, I'm Caroline,
Max's friend.

Any way we can get
the price down a bit for these?

I think $8 is steep,
considering their condition.

I happen to know
the heel has been replaced.

I cannot believe
you're trying to shoe her down.

I can do $6.

Deal.

Oh, you happy?

You haggled a charity.

You're turning Goodwill
into bad will.

My t-shirt's gone.

It's not here.

I bet it was that
Puerto Rican girl,

who was--
who was eyeing it.

Maria, can we call security?

I'm sure one of the cameras
must have captured the theft.

Cameras? What do you think
this is, target?

It's gone, Caroline.

She must have stolen it

while I was watching you
do your stupid $5 dance.

I didn't turn my back on
the rack, why am I under attack?

See, this is why I shop alone,
this is why I eat alone,

this is why I'm leaving alone.

Maria, I'll pay for these.

You don't have to box them,
you can just use tissue paper.

Even as I'm saying this,
I know it's not gonna happen.

Vagina!

Yeah!

Wow. Girl,
your bartender friend is cute.

Look at those arms.
Nice guns.

He's not just a bartender,
this dude is legit.

He's a street artist,
goes by "Jpeg."

Hmm.
Well, right now

he's cutting up limes
and cleaning glasses.

Well, you're an heiress

who's slinging burnt hash
and stale toast.

Touche.

Douch-ay.

These are from the gentleman
with a sweet note,

"Nice ass, nice rack."

Whoo!

Hoo.

If that's your tequila noise,

God knows
what your orgasm sounds like.

Same face, no sound.

Oh, my God.

I can't believe it,
it's the girl from the 'Will.

I got your back, gir-r-r.

What is she doin'?

She thinks Goodwill
has made her tough.

Um, hi.
How are you?

I just wanted to talk to you

about that shirt
at the Goodwill.

See, my friend really wanted it,
and, well, your friend has it.

What are you sayin', bitch?

Okay, I think we might have
got off on the wrong foot.

Do you want to feel my foot,
bitch?

Well, I guess we know
what your favorite word is.

Ow!

Those are not extensions,
bitch!

Oh!

I should break this up,
I should break this up.

No, no, no, give her like four
seconds to learn her lesson.

Oh, okay, ow!
All right. All right!

- Okay, okay, okay.
- Ow! Oh, oh.

Okay, come on, come on.

- Oh!
- It's okay.

Those are not extensions,
bitch!

Are you still laughing,
'cause it wasn't funny.

It was so funny.
It was like looney tunes funny.

It was like Bugs Bunny
getting shot in the face funny.

Only in your version,

Bugs Bunny tries to have
a dialogue with the shotgun.

I was trying

to get your t-shirt back.

I wanted you to have it,

because you lit up at the 'Will
when you saw it.

I do not light up, okay?

There's no light inside me.

What you're seeing
is probably radiation

from the summer
I collected uranium tubes

by the train tracks.
That was good money.

Thanks for looking out for me,
Caroline.

You're welcome, Max.

It's a t-shirt,
it's gone.

I don't get attached to things.

Ow. My nail practically
got torn off back there

by "Cat Von D-Minus."

I'm gonna have to
sleep with it elevated.

Is there a nail place
around here?

Well, this is New York,

so there's probably
gonna be one right...

here.
Love when that happens.

Look, a two-for-one
girlfriend special. Genius.

Go with me tomorrow before work,
it'll be cheaper if we both go.

I really need one.

Plus, you need one, too.

Well, I can't. I have my own
day of luxury already booked.

I'm doing a laundry, and then
the tasting menu at Wendy's.

Come on. You and me, nails,
and air conditioning.

It'll be fun.

You're doin' it,
gir-r-rl.

Me and my friends
used to love getting manicures.

'Cause they're black drag queens?

Oh.

Hey, dude.

It's about that time?

Let me get the pooper scooper.

All right.
Let's do this.

- Hey.

Let me ask you something.
How is it that you,

a horse, and Caroline
are both living with me,

and you're
less of a problem for me?

I mean, you tell me,
you've known her longer.

She picks a fight
with a tatted-out white chick

from the Bronx?
What is up with that?

I don't know, man,
I'm just used to it.

That's what you'd sound like,
if you talked.

I agree with you,
by the way.

Everything you say is right,
Max.

Thank you, Chestnut.

You should kill her.

Chestnut!
I can't do that.

It'll be easy.
We could kill her and eat her.

Chestnut!

All right, buddy,
here's your spot.

Come on, do your business.

Come on, Ches.

Buh-buh-buh buh-buh.

Buh-buh-buh buh-boo.
Come on.

Come on!

Come on, Chestnut,
I got a lot of crap to do today.

And so do you.

Jeez, don't be shy, buddy...

I hope you're happy. I look
like a Cambodian stripper.

Um, they prefer to be called
"ping pong ball artists."

These cost $70.43.

She forced me to get tips,
and then tip her for the tips.

See, and all because
you never showed up,

I didn't get
the two-for-one discount,

because I was waiting alone,
for you.

Max, I have really tried
to be girlfriends with you,

but you obviously
have some issues.

Follow me to the walk-in.

Good, let's get it out.

Here.

I thought we were gonna talk.

No, we just didn't have
any chocolate cream in the case.

Why didn't you show up?

You told me
you were gonna be there.

Well,
I had a lot of crap to do.

Well, you gave me
the impression you were going.

I gave you the impression?
I don't do impressions.

Well, wait, that's not true,
I do one, my mom.

But to do that.
I need a Christmas tree,

a gallon of vodka,
and a lit cigarette.

So are we
gonna be girlfriends or not?

Look, I'm gonna
give this to you straight up.

I am never gonna be the type
of girlfriend you're used to.

I am not your gir-r-r,
or your gir-r-rl,

and I am definitely not

someone's two-for-one girlfriend
crap at a nail store.

In fact, think of me as a dude.

So-o-o,
are we good?

Yeah. We good.

I get it.
You're not a girl's girl.

Okay, good.

I can be a girl's girl.

Oh, Caroline,

please do not take
advantage of me with your horse.

What?

My trash pick up company
charged me extra,

because my dumpster is full
of all your horse droppings.

How would that be possible?

I see your good friend, Max,
walking your horse every morning

and dropping droppings
in my dumpster.

Hi.

Hello.

Did you walk my horse today?

Yeah, and every other morning.

That's so sweet.
I wish I had known.

Well, what was I gonna do,
post it on your Facebook wall?

"Ha, walked a horse again today.
Totes gross."

Besides, who did you think
was doing it?

I've always just
had things done for me,

I've never really thought about
the people doing them.

Yeah, and I've never had
things done for me,

so I just do them.

Like now,
how I'm making the coffee,

and you're just standing here
watching me.

Still,
I wish you would have told me,

so I could say thank you.

Well, it's not really my style.

You are one complicated dude.

Pick up, borscht.

- Unbelievable.
- What?

Hey.
How you guys doin'?

Cute strokes tee.

Probably look better on me,
considering it's mine.

You snooze, you lose, puta.

Nice language!

You kiss your obviously closeted
boyfriend with that mouth?

You know what?
I wouldn't even want it now.

Now that it's been on you,

might as well have been
a Kenny G shirt.

And now I walk.

You can't just let her win.

Oh, forget it, it's over.

Borscht!
Pick up, pick up.

Hi, I'll be right with you.

Oh!

- Idiota!
- Oh.

Esta camiseta
me costo cuatro dolares!

Te voy a cortar.

Lo siento.
Todo es mi culpa.

I'm still a little clumsy,
it's my first week.

I'll bring you some soda water,
but seriously,

your boyfriend will come out
before that borscht stain does.

That was awesome.

Yeah.
I kinda just do stuff.

Like I just did, while you were
standing there watching me.

Thanks, gir-r-rlfriend.

Oh.

What, is she coming for me?

Run.

Your waitress just went on break, and
I'm just someone who likes dressing

like a polyester hot dog, so I'll
take that whenever you're ready.

There you go.
No rush.

Okay, Mr. Rajeev Guttikonda.

I have to say, that's a pretty
Gutti scheme you got going there,

but I Guttikonda
don't believe it.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you saying there?

What am I saying there, Boston?

I'm saying I believe you watched
Slumdog Millionaire

on a sticky couch
in your mom's basement,

but I'm not buying
that you're Indian.

So take your fake, East Boston,
Indian accent out of here,

or I'll call the cops.

Dude, stolen credit card,
and you choose to eat here?

That's the real crime.

Hey, Rajeev.

Rajeev, my man.

Rajeev Gudikanda.

You know what?
This one's on me.

[chuckles]
I have trust issues.

Season 3, Episode 5
"And the Cronuts"




That's weird. We still have
three Red Velvets left.

I guess that bulimic girl
didn't come in today.

No, she's here.
She's in the bathroom.

Hmm, if I save these for her,
would that be helping or hurting?

Hey, everybody.

Speaking of hurting,
here comes a pain in my ass.

Han, do you want the last Red Velvet?
The other two are for the bulimic girl.

I made the call.

No more cupcakes for me. I've been
on a juice cleanse for six days.

Han's on the prowl, and I got
to keep this body tight, son.

I'm in the dating pool,
you know.

Yeah, the shallow end.

You know those cleanses
never work, right?

Really?
Then how do you explain this?

I don't know. Am I supposed
to rub it and make a wish?

Not bad for having
three kids, Han.

What? You don't see
my abs coming in?

I see one large ab
coming in.

That's at least a two-pack.

Han, the real Tupac is more
alive than your two-pack.

I'm gonna give this last cupcake
away as a free sample.

My promotional tweets haven't
been getting much love lately.

What'd you say? I black out
whenever you use work words.

All I said was "promotional
tweets" and "sample."

What?

Here you go, ladies, a Max's
homemade cupcake on the house.

Nah, I'm cool.

I'm saving my calories for one
of those fabulous new cronuts.

Plus, cupcakes are so over.

Well, so is blossom, but...

It didn't stop you
from wearing that outfit.

- Those flower power skanks over there...
- "Flower Power skanks."

See, these are words
I recognize and hear.

Anyway, she said
she only cares about cronuts

and that cupcakes are over.

- Cupcakes are classic, right?
- Don't listen to them.

They're wearing
high-waisted jeans.

The only time I like
seeing women's jeans that high

is when I'm giving Han
a wedgie.

Also, what's a cronut?

Cronut is what we called
my Croatian cousin with one testicle.

He hung himself.

Okay, well, in America,
it's a half-croissant, half-doughnut.

They're on the news, Twitter, Instagram.
People can't stop talking about them.

If cronuts had tongues,
they'd be the Miley Cyrus of pastries.

You're right.
They sound stupid.

Stupid delicious.
Where can I get one?

You can only get them
at this one pastry shop in Soho,

and people start lining up
at 4:00 a.m.

Boy, times do change.

Back in the day, 4:00 a.m.
was when people would snort lines,

not stand in 'em.

Who has the time to wait in line
all day for a piece of lame pastry?

Hey, everyone.
I got a cronut.

I waited in line
for two whole days.

Sophie, you bought
into the hype too?

Oh, come on, you know your girl
Sophie is always on trend.

I was the first one
wearing crocs.

I brought the crocs craze
to America.

When I was rich, I sent 10,000 pairs
of crocs to children in Africa.

Why, to make them
less cool?

Look, girls, here I am
in the cronut line.

And here I am still in line.

Oh, and... oh, and here I am
riding a baby elephant.

And here I am
eating a cronut.

Max, as stupid as it is,
we've got to go over there.

We need to figure out
what they have that we don't.

Oh, I'll tell you
what they have.

Cronuts.

Oh, my god.
Look at this line.

I knew we should have gotten here sooner,
but, no, I had to be a good person,

I had to carry that torso man on the
skateboard up the subway stairs.

All this is for a croissant
and a doughnut?

Those things
already existed.

Where was all the fanfare when
I combined the sleeping pill

with the morning after pill
and called it

the "sleep-through-
the-morning-after" pill?

How did these things
get so popular?

There's no science
to this trend stuff.

It's all decided by one bitchy gay guy
typing in his room, making it all up.

Well, then we have to do
some trend research.

We've got to figure out how to make Max's
homemade cupcakes the next cronuts.

I hate all these stupid trends.
Cleanses, cronuts, condoms...

Excuse me, sir,

My name's Caroline.
I'm a trend researcher.

I'm Chuck.
I sell magnets.

What made you want to spend
an entire day in line for cronuts?

I like croissants.
I like doughnuts.

I'm a fat guy.
It all adds up.

That's true.
You are a fat guy.

And there's a doughnut shop
right across the street.

So why don't you just
stop there, get a damn doughnut,

and save yourself the last 200 possibly
life-threatening steps to here?

Look, it's two things
I like put together.

End of story.

That's it, Max.
It's the two things together.

One thing
isn't enough anymore.

Yeah, that's why Oleg’s cousin
hung himself.

I'm serious.

When's the last time
you did just one thing?

Like, watch a movie without
playing a game on your phone?

Magic Mike.

Wait, does playing
with yourself count?

Come on, let's get
to the end of the line.

[scoffs] End of the line...?
That's for rookies.

I'm a line pro.

My mom and I waited in line for
food stamps, Bob Seger lawn seats...

We spent a Saturday
in the "guns for cash" line.

Now that's a line
you don't want to cut in.

Follow my lead.

Hey, man, cronut line.
What do you want to do after this?

[all shouting]

Okay, all right, all right.
Back of the line.

Everybody relax.

Guess my mom being topless had more
to do with my line skills than I thought.

Oh, great.
Look at the cronut line.

I told you
we should have left sooner,

but, no, you said
we had to stay at temple.

You're the rabbi.

Yeah, a career I was forced into because
someone wanted to write his memoir.

We get it, Garry.
You're adopted.

Move up, hon.
You gotta fill the gap.

I would if you would stop
trying to fill my gap.

What difference does it make?

You're still gonna have
the same amount of time to wait.

And then, in 30 years, we're all
gonna die from Wi-Fi cancer.

Okay, let's all
just take a breath.

It looks like we're
gonna be here for a while.

You know what? You're right.
Hi, I'm Jerri.

- And I'm Garry.
- I'm Jerri, he's Garry.

I'm tall, he's small.

Cute, right?
That's our thing.

I'm Caroline,
and this is Max.

That's it.
We don't have a thing.

- So what drew you here today?
- Oh, well, we're trend-chasers.

When something new hits,
we are on it

- ...like sea salt on dark chocolate.
- Hmm.

We did pinkberry, dippin' dots,
kale, quinoa, Kombucha...

All the ka's.
Just 'cause.

[laughter]

Can you tell
we don't have kids?

- She couldn't.
- Garry!

Actually, it's true, and you can
read all about it in his memoir.

It's called...
[snores]

You know what? Jerri, Garry.
I think we got too close too soon.

Maybe we need
a little space.

We got to move up in line
to get away from these people.

Should I just
take my top off?

- Next in line.
- [gasps] It happened!

- We made it to the front of the line!
- We're the front people!

Yeah, we're the front people!
Back people suck!

No, no, I said "back people,"
"back people."

Baruch Hashem.

We loved The Butler.

You know,
we've been through a lot.

Tempers flared,
things were said.

I'm fairly certain
that Dutch guy back there died.

But we made it,
and you guys are good people.

The sea salt of the earth.

- Who's next?
- (all) We are.

I can only take a party of two.
Are all four of you together?

- Nope.
- We don't know them.

- Guys...?
- Cut 'em loose, Gar.

All sold out.
We're closed.

I know you're driven mad
with the power of being

a doorman at a bakery,
but come on!

Max, you know what I want
more than anything?

To kill Jerri and Garry?
'Cause I'm totally on board.

No, I want our business
to have a line.

I want to sell out.

I want people to turn against
each other for our product.

Again, I could
just take my top off.

I know, and thank you.
We have that in our back pocket.

But I have an idea
we can try first.

I'm gonna use work words now,
so listen up, skank.

I'm listening.

I read
in The Wall Street Journal

that there's a whole black market
for cronuts on Craigslist.

Craigslist? Oh, no.

I don't want one bad enough to let some
guy lick my armpit for an hour again.

They're not for us.

We'll sell them at our window,
just to attract attention,

and then, when they sell out,
we'll effortlessly switch to cupcakes.

Classic bake and switch.

All that work
for some stupid fad?

I said "fad."

We loved
"Behind the Candelabra".

Try texting him again.
He's 15 minutes late.

You're really surprised
that a guy reselling pastries

in the "Rants and Raves" section
of Craigslist isn't the punctual type?

[knocking on window]

This is so exciting.

I've never bought anything
on the black market before.

I'm still afraid to go to that
Filipino market around the corner.

Are you the guy?

I don't know.
Are you the girl?

So far,
this musical sucks.

- What's the password?
- Cronut.

Was "1234"
already taken?

Meet us by the door.

Which is code for,
"Meet us by the door."

Which is code for,
"You're really bad at code."

Okay, let's talk about our plan.
It's a classic good cop/bad cop.

I'm gonna ask the guy for ten cronuts,
and he's gonna quote me 250.

Right, then I play bad cop
and act outraged.

And then I play good cop,
and we settle at 200.

Yeah, and don't worry about me.
I'll improve some good stuff on the spot.

Are you sure you don't
want to run it by me first?

I was in an improve group
at Wharton.

We were called
"The fun percent."

And I can imagine myself not laughing
with 99% of the audience.

Let's make it quick.

You're not the only girls
in town who want my nuts!

I assume you mean cronuts.

No, I'm also
a male prostitute.

Let's see the product.

She meant
the other baked goods.

You got to be clear.

Pretty maids,
all in a row.

Let mama get a taste.

That's pure.
How much for ten?

I know I said 250 earlier,
but...

Bullcrap!
150 or we walk, bitch!

Okay, let's all just calm down.
It's a really good deal, Max.

How about we settle at 200
and call it a night?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
About that.

I be getting mad offers
for these things tonight.

I actually got to raise it
to 300, or I walk.

Bitch.

Ooh, ow, ow,
ooh, your hands are cold.

What'd you call me?

- Nothing.
- That's what I thought.

She said 200. We'll pay 200.
And you'll take it.

You'll shove it in this hanes
her way hoodie you're wearing,

you'll say, "Thank you, Max"
and you'll hit the bricks, capisce?

Caroline, cash.

- Thank you, Max.
- What'd you say?

Thank you, Max!

I've got the chills now.
Do you guys serve tea?

How's that for bad cop?

Riveting. I felt like I was watching
SVU: Bakery edition.

Okay, here we go.
This is the last one.

You want this cronut?

Lift up your shirt
and let me see 'em.

Go get Han. I want to show him
what an ab is.

Max, you should see the line.
It's halfway down the block.

- We have a line. It's working.
- But what's gonna happen now?

I worked at Target the Christmas,
they ran out of Tickle me Elmo,

and... there was so much blood.

As planned, we'll just calmly
switch to our delicious cupcakes,

and then those'll sell out too
because they're that good.

Okay.

Attention, everyone.
Everyone, can I have your attention?

Actually, we are very sorry, but
we are now sold out of cronuts.

[all groaning]

We do, however,
have something even better...

Max's homemade cupcakes.

[all yelling]

All right, go!

Leave.
Chase your stupid trends.

But we're not worried!
Cupcakes are classic!

We're Audrey Hepburn!

Max, cupcakes are over.

And you know why? Because
cupcakes are just one thing.

If we had two things,
then we'd be something.

That does it.
I'm calling the dealer.

I don't think
we should order more cronuts.

Oh, no, I mean my drug dealer.
I need to take the edge off.

This sucks. I feel worse about myself
than I did when I dropped the torso man.

- What are you doing with those fries?
- I'm dipping 'em in frosting.

I do it when I'm depressed.

I went right from baby food
into fries in frosting.

Is it good?
It looks disgusting.

It is both.
Just taste it.

These are pretty good.

Sweet and salty.
Cupcakes and fries.

That's two things.

Cake fries.
We're millionaires.

My willingness to eat anything
finally pays off!

Wait, are you sure it's not
just us being desperate?

Like, when Adam Levine made
that music video in Brooklyn

and you walked past the set
all day in a wet tank top?

It can't hurt to put them
out there.

That's what you said
that day too.

- Just sit down for a second, Han.
- But this is the middle of a shift.

I'm gonna tell everyone you're
in the middle of a male-to-female shift

if you don't sit down.

All right.

You are here tonight
to taste the next big thing.

Okay, now you're just repeating
my pick-up lines back to me.

No, it's a new dessert, and we've
assembled the perfect focus group...

A black man, a pig,
and a health fanatic.

Y'all know who you are.

I suppose I have been
trying to eat better lately.

Hey, extra, extra!
Read all about it!

I'm bisexual now!

Oh, perfect, now we have
the LGBTQ community represented.

- What's the "Q"?
- Questioning.

And answered.

Hey, everybody.
Meet Veronica.

She's cute, she's black, she has
short blonde hair, she's exciting.

- And we met in Soul Cycle class.
- Yes, we did.

I slipped in her sweat
and she bought me a Luna bar.

Now?
Now you're bisexual?

Well, yeah, you got
to keep up with the trends.

Okay, focus group.
Let's focus.

This is our new product,
called Cake Fries.

Cute, right?

You just take a fry
from the left side,

dip it into the cupcake frosting
on the right,

and enjoy your sweet,
yet savory dessert.

Is this woman seriously trying
to teach me how to eat food?

Oh, no, this looks very fattening,
and I've been on a fast.

- One lick isn't going to kill you.
- Yeah, just ask Sophie.

Okay, one bite.

Now I don't want any of you
to hold back.

Be completely honest
in your criticism.

- Well, I feel like...
- Shut up, Han.

No, I was gonna say
this is very good.

Too good.

Uh-oh, look away, girls.
You've released the Kraken.

Damn.
That is tasty.

Now you may have
given me diabetes,

as I have just lost the feeling
in my left foot.

You know what, I think
I might be trisexual,

because I'm having a love affair
with these cake fries.

Oh, my gosh,
this is gross.

And it's very messy.

Oh, come on,
then what was earlier?

Okay, everyone,
this is all very helpful.

We're still
working some things out.

Uh-oh.
My tummy feels funny.

You mean your ab is hurting?

Han, your first food in a week
probably shouldn't have been

a fistful of fries
and frosting.

You know what, guys?
We've all worked hard today.

- Let's call it a night.
- But it's only 9:00.

Pardon me. Excuse me.

Uh-oh. You don't want
to see that...

Look out!

Move it.
Move it or lose it.

Move it or I lose it.

Out of way, out of my way now!

Oh, dear...

This is more embarrassing
than when Han fell asleep

and Oleg drew a penis
on his face.

I traced that penis
on his face.

Now you dip the fries in the frosting,
but I find the best way to eat this

is to first make sure
you feel super empty inside.

Not gonna be a problem.

These are adorable.

Could you please
take a picture of me with it?

It's so cute.

And make sure
you hashtag that picture

"Max's homemade cake fries"
when you post it online.

A sad girl smiling
with our cake fries.

Once that hits iVillage, we'll be
knee-deep in canvas totes and cankles.

[Caroline laughing]
Here you go!

Sorry, that was our last cake fries.
We'll have more tomorrow.

- Wait. We sold out?
- We sold out!

Oh, my god!
We sold out!

Yes! I'm a sell-out!
Let's buy a helicopter!

Hi, girls.

Oh, hey, Sophie. We're sorry,
but we just ran out of cake fries.

Oh, that's fine by me.
I'm going back to the basics.

Cupcakes and penis.

Here's your cupcake.
We don't sell the other basic.

Mm...

You know,
it's nice to eat something

you don't have to compliment
every five minutes.

You know what, Max?

Cupcakes, cronuts,
cake fries, whatever.

We're gonna be successful because we have
the two things that really matter...

You and me.

We're kinda like cake fries.
I mean, salty and sweet.

- I'm sweet...
- And I've been assaulted.

Thank you, everyone,
for staying late

to learn our new
iPad order system.

We had no choice, you locked
the door from the outside.

[chuckles]
Either way, we're learning.

Han, why would we update
our order system

when our uniforms
are from the 1970's

and our paycheck
is from the 1800s?

Let's get to the tutorial.

Max, you and I
are going to role-play.

All right, you can be
the little bitch,

and I'll be me.

I don't need this lesson.

I'm very familiar
with the touch screen.

Let's just say
I put the "goo" in Google.

I'm going to pretend
I'm a customer,

and order a hamburger.

Hello, miss.
I'll have a hamburger.

Certainly, miss.
[chuckles]

Would you like that
with or without Salmonella?

Han, I got my first lesson
on the iPad from Steve Jobs,

and now I'm getting it
from Han Jobs?

Caroline, don't act like you
know more about gadgets than me.

Formerly rich doesn't beat
currently Asian.

Now, come on, everyone
look at their iPads.

What iPad?
I didn't see an iPad

What? No.

Did somebody say something
about an iPad?

What the hell is an iPad?

Where did they all go?

I'm guessing eBay.

I want them all back,
especially mine.

I'm in a casual flirtation
with a woman in Australia.

She's part aboriginal,
but has a great personality.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

[cash register bell dings]

¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

Here you go, Earl.

Max, what's wrong?
You seem happy.

I'm just still on a high
from this $10,000 bank loan

I got last week.

And from an almost certainly
laced pot brownie I ate in 2004.

I can't believe you and Caroline
got a bank loan

for your cupcake business,

and not a single hostage
was involved.

Max, you don't have
$10,000.

You don't even have Netflix.

This money is to pay a factory
to make our cupcake T-shirts,

and I've whittled it
down to three.

Hello.

Speaking of whittled.

Someone used my printer,
and I'm guessing it's Caroline,

'cause it's about business

and not another one of Earl's
Angela Bassett collages.

What can I say, man?
I'm a Bassett hound.

Oh, thanks, Han.

These are the factories
I've been researching.

We want our T-shirts
to be American made.

I have an American maid,

and all she's good at
is eating my granola bars.

Look, Max, I found one
right here in Brooklyn.

"American Ace.
The founder, Ace Hardwick,

is devoted to treating
his workers well,"

and not in a creepy way
like that American Apparel guy.

So you're saying
none of these workers

have ever found
an Ace in their hole?

Look, I've worked
in a lot of factories.

I know what goes on.

I worked in a coat factory,

which is why my lungs
are coated in asbestos.

I worked
in an underwear factory,

where I was underpaid
for the fruits of my looms,

and worst factory of all,
The Cheesecake Factory.

Oh.

How about we do
a walk-through tomorrow

to make sure
it's up to snuff?

Well, if they have snuff,

why are we waiting
till tomorrow?

Hey, everybody!
[laughs]

Oh, hey.
Hi, great news!

I just got carded
at Buffalo Wild Wings!

Really?
I got carted out of there once.

And more great news:

I'm starting
my own new business.

So girls, you know
how you have that $10,000?

Well, I don't want
to clean you out,

but how do you feel
about tossing me $9,500?

You two should invest.
Sophie's business is genius.

You know how a bunch of ladies
got their down-there-hair

permanently lasered off?

Yeah, that's when your waxer
gives you a Michael Chiklis.

Yeah.

Well, Sophie's offering
a product

that puts grass
back on your field.

(Sophie)
Yeah.

That's not a business.
That's nobody's business.

Yeah, I don't do
any of that stuff.

I just throw a scrunchie
on mine and go.

Hey, there's a need for this.
Sometimes, in the fog,

my plane gets lost
without a landing strip.

We're out.

Oh, don't decide yet, girls.

you haven't even heard
the cute, little name.

"Sophie Kuchenksi's
Vagina Wigs!"

Yeah, we're really out.

Oh.
But it's a quality product,

and it's real hair
imported from "Va-China."

Yeah, never been
further out.

And this is our main floor.

[gasps]
Wow, this is amazing!

I feel like we're
in the Willy Wonka Factory.

I know, right?

The American Ace motto
is "work is fun."

Max was expecting
a different kind of factory.

More torture,
less foosball.

I know, right?
Not at American Ace.

And what is your position here,
Peggy?

Are you the "I know, right?"
person?

[laughs]
I know, right?

No, I'm one of the owners.
Also, I dye T-shirts.

See, every employee gets
a percentage of the company

after six months, so the longer
you stay, the more it grows.

We've been at the diner
four years,

and the only thing we've seen
grow is Oleg's pants.

I know, right?

Well, Ace is expecting you.
Go ahead, go have fun!

[laughs]

Hey, don't be fooled
by what's on the surface.

You look like
you have money,

but I know your underwear's
in shreds.

Not shreds, Max, shred.

Just one, it goes
from front to back.

Um, hi, should we just come in?
The door is open.

Yep, always is.

Doors create boundaries.
Boundaries are a bummer.

You know what else
is a bummer?

Tall guys
with small penises?

That you just missed the gelato
and designer coffee cart.

Espresso hazelnut praline?

We're not here for gelato.

[chuckles]
We're not not here for gelato.

Awesome.
It's awesome to meet you.

I'm Ace Hardwick.

Look, "Ace", we're not
about to give you $10,000

so you can take advantage
of a sad, underage girl worker

near the loading docks
'cause her boobs are crazy big

and she needs a ride home.

That's a "for instance."

I'm sorry?

See, Ace, Max has
some trust issues

when it comes to factories,
so, we're here today to--

You're pretty much
eating cardboard there.

You want me to get you
another?

You should see her
with tuna cans.

Hey, I see the prosciutto cart.

Who wants imported ham?

Me!
[laughs]

Well, we're not not here
for prosciutto.

Hey, you know what's cool?

Short guys with big penises?

[laughs]
You're fun.

Your business
belongs here at American Ace.

Come on, let's go
meet the family.

That guy kind of
creeps me out.

On the plus side,
I finally get to meet my family.

I had this space designed
for open energy

and open conversation.

What's up, other owners?

(all)
What's up, Ace?

Our sales, by 400%!

[all cheering]

Max, this is it.
This is our factory.

(Caroline)
The employees look
happy and successful.

So did the members
of 'N Sync.

but behind the curtain,
a veil of tears.

Hey, Caroline,
here's the prosciutto cart.

[gasps]
Thanks, Ace!

Enjoy.
I'm just gonna get

a quick five-minute
chair massage.

Come on, let's slip out
while Ace has got his head

stuck in that chair's ass.

Hey, what's up?

Welcome to American Ace.
I'm Rico.

You're, like, really,
really, really pretty.

Aw--oh!

So anyways, I'm part owner,
and I clean the bathroom.

Hmm, quick question:
do you have a light Cabernet?

Quicker question:

where's the secret room
with the toddler slaves?

What's up? I'm Raul,
part owner and security guard.

Hey, you two want to grab
a drink sometime?

Fridays after work, we all hang
next door at Tortilla Flats.

Tortilla Flat.
Wasn't that your stripper name?

You're just jealous
'cause mine's taller

and thinks I'm really,
really, really pretty.

Good luck with that
tall guy scenario.

Sorry we're late, but we were
busy with our other business,

the one we care about.

How can I be mad with that
sincere, heartfelt apology?

Who wants to see
our sample T-shirts?

I want to see it, but I want
to see a lot of things.

With these damn cataracts,
the best I can do

is look towards it
and get a milky idea.

Hey, girls!

I want to show you
some of my new styles

for my "Everybody's Merkin
for the Weekend" collection.

Sophie, what's a merkin?

It's a vagina wig.

Oh, that's dirty.

And Han, I'm gonna need
your input,

because I'm working
on an Asian line.

Shouldn't Han grow
some hair on his

before he starts
tossing out advice?

Han, I need to know
if I got the texture right,

so come over here.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, that feels nice.
Ohh.

Ohh.

Yeah, nice and thick
between my fingers.

Oh, yeah.

Slower.

Slower still.

This is like watching
your gerbil hump a pencil.

Not really sexual,
but still grosses you out.

Sophie,
I-I think you should stop.

I haven't felt this sensation
since third grade

when Madam Yi checked me
for head lice.

Remind me to pick up a
"What's Happening To My Body?"

book for Han tomorrow.

Oh, girls,
I'll be over here,

working on my
African/American line.

Yeah, I can't decide whether
to call it a "vag-afro"

or a "Pube-a Gooding, Jr."

Max, look.
These shirts look amazing.

Well, I guess I was wrong
about the factory.

Like I was wrong about you

making it
through that first winter.

Look, there's a note
in here.

Oh, it's probably from Rico.
He's obsessed with me.

Yeah, it's not from him.

It says, "Help us."

Underpaid workers are trapped
in that factory, I knew it!

Once again, I was fooled
by ice cream.

Yes, it's a note that says,
"Help us,"

but if there's one thing
I learned in business school,

it's if you don't see it,
it doesn't exist.

Look, as much as we want to,
we can't just look away.

We need to talk
to the workers.

Call the guy, the one
who thinks you're pretty.

I don't know who
you're talking about.

I only met a guy
who thought

I was really, really,
really pretty.

We can meet them
at that Mexican place.

Ooh, a Mexican place!

I forgot about
the Latina market!

Girls, when you're there,
find out if they'd be interested

in some hair
south of the border.

Didn't know if you ladies wanted
beers or margaritas,

so we got you Beer-garitas.

It's five bucks,
but you're worth it.

I love a girl
with a healthy appetite.

Well, you're gonna be
getting down on one knee

before the end
of the appetizers.

So let's just dive right in.
How's factory life treating you?

Give us the skinny--
which is what I hope you said

when you ordered
those Beer-garitas,

'cause I cannot be poor
with a muffin top.

You know, I don't want
to talk about work.

Oh, are you saying you're not
allowed to talk about work?

Your words, we all heard you,
Rico or Raul.

Hey, tell me, what do you girls
like to do?

Mm, I like to watch waiters
make guacamole at my table.

When's that gonna happen?

[sighs]

So about work--
- Yeah, okay.

Hey, let's go see what's
going on in Beer-garitaville.

What are we gonna do?
I can't get any information

out of Rico.
He's so preoccupied

with how pretty, pretty,
pretty I am.

Oh, hi, Peggy.
How are you?

Would you like to join us
and talk about work?

Why don't we talk
about you two skanks

gettin' the hell outta here?

And I thought we were
bad waitresses.

This is Carmen.
She works at the factory too.

We're BFFs, and she's
one of the owners, like me.

Yeah, and she's a 100% owner
of Rico, so hands off.

We seen you two
sittin' over here

like you're God's
friggin' gift.

I know, right?
And not for nothing,

but Rico's pit bull
doesn't like other girls.

I'm guessing
that's his pit bull.

And you, hands off Raul.

We have a love
that is deep and real,

and when he finds out about it,
it's gonna be magic.

Yup...
Exactly what I expected.

Upstairs
is Willy Wonka's factory,

and down here, they're
waterboarding Oompa Loompas.

Yo, what's up?
We just comin' here to work

in the dye room
right there as per usual.

Yeah, no biggie.
What yous twos lookin' at?

That was a really good accent.

Thanks.
I played Rizzo in Grease.

Should have been Sandy,
but I let

the girl with the limp
have it.

Come on, we have to put these on
and go into the dye room,

'cause I'm guessing
that's where it all goes down.

The dye room,
I'm not surprised.

I always knew
we'd dye together.

Okay, we'll just pretend
to be working here,

like we do at the diner.

Well, well,
look who it is,

Stuck-Up and Stuck-Up Two:
The Legend Returns.

Max, we gotta go.
My life can't end wearing grey.

What up, ladies?

Last night, you're hanging
with the homies,

and today, boom, you just happen
to be working here.

That's friggin' convenient.

I know, right?

Very friggin' convenient.

I know, right?

We just have to show them
who's boss.

You know, like we do
with the mouse

who lives in our toaster.

So, what, we're gonna scream
and then spray Windex at them?

Yo!
See this scar?

Knife fight
with five Catholic schoolgirls

over a slushie.
So unless you want

some of what I gave Virginia,
Stephanie, Laquetia, Latoya,

and the one in the wheelchair,
I'd stay clear.

This is just
a misunderstanding.

Rico's not interested in me.

Well, he seemed
pretty into you last night.

Huh, yeah, but that's
before she talked.

Come on, we are not interested
in your men at all.

Not at all.
I mean, come on.

What's that mean?

You're saying
something's wrong with them?

No, she's not saying that
It's just--

It's just what?

We're lovers.

You two are lovers?
'Cause you don't seem--

We don't seem what?
Gay?

No.
Hot enough.

[scoffs]
Well--

Not hot at all.

I know, right?

Look busy,
keep your eyes open.

I think we're in the belly
of the beast.

You talkin' about me?

(both)
No.

(Caroline)
Max, what do you think's
behind that locked door?

I knew it!
Toddler slaves.

Those kids are in horrible
danger of becoming...me.

Come on,
let's go over there.

What the--
you hit me!

Sorry, so sorry.
Accident!

You throw like a girl.

See, I knew it,
you two aren't gay.

Yous are after our guys!

No, I'm not!
Rico just thought I was

really, really,
really pretty.

Oh, hell no!
Leave my lover alone!

Oh!

It's on!

(Caroline)
- [whimpers] No! No!

It's--no, no, no, no, no!
It's not on.

This is silly.
We're not after anyone.

we're here to help
some of those work--

Oh, yeah.
Now, it's on!

Oh!
I warn you!

[both whimpering]

Oh, hell no!

Back off, bitch!

Who you calling bitch,
bitch?

Honey?
You're getting carried away.

[whimpers]

Now you're really getting
carried away.

Oh, no!
Don't put me in the dryer!

I used to be rich,
I'm dry clean only!

[strains]

(both)
Oh! Oh!

That was a big
friggin' mistake!

Respect.

You two are a lot tougher

than those girls
from Saint Bridget's.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's happening?

We're busting you.
We know what's happening here.

What, profit sharing
and healthcare?

We found a note in our box
with "help us" scrawled on it.

How do you explain that?

Did you read the back?

Heh heh heh.

"Help us..

"help you...

to your full potential
at American Ace."

We put one
in every box we ship.

I have got to start reading

more than the first sentence
of stuff.

I'm sorry,
this is all my fault.

I guess I just wanted
to believe

some kids were having
a worse childhood than I was.

Max, don't feel bad.
You thought someone needed help,

and you cared, and that
makes you a good person,

and I'm proud of you.

I said I was sorry.
You don't have to be mean.

Hey, everybody!

I just got my first shipment
of wigs.

Sophie, why are you
walking like that?

Well, I'm not just
the president,

I'm also a client.

Sophie, I think you dropped
something,

unless we have those
giant Persian roaches again.

Even a milky version of that
was too much.

You know, Max, maybe someday,
someone like you will come

into this Salmonella factory
and rescue us.

What are you writing
on those checks?

"Help us."

We work here.
The "help us" is implied.

Caroline, I'm home!

I mean, I'm hotel!

I'm upstairs,

because we have an upstairs!

Thank you for losing all
your money so Hollywood

would buy your story and I
could buy all the pot I want.

Hello, darling. You're just in time

for my big Hollywood entrance.

Hold up, Greta Garbage.

I just want to tell Earl
about the pot sitch out here.

He'll think it's high-larious.

You never want to watch me walk.

What up, Earl? It's your girl, Max,

calling from Holly-weed, Cali-juana.

Hey, Max, it's not the
same without you here.

A lot less customers crying.

Listen to this!

They just give you pot cards out here.

All I had to say was "Sure, I get sad."

Hey, I'm an 80-year-old man
working at a dead-end diner.

I bet I'd get two cards.

Is that Max? Let me talk to her.

I can't find my white golf
glove, and I know you took it!

Han, keep your panties on.

I have no idea where your glove is.

Oh, I'm driving through the hills.

I'm... breaking... up. Aah... uhh...

Okay, here comes my
big Hollywood entrance.

Hello, darling... I hope
I haven't kept you waiting.

Oh, my God! Are you okay?

Uh-huh.

I'm head over heels for Hollywood, baby.


Just put it wherever you
would usually put things

for, like, a big Hollywood
meeting with screenwriters

who are writing your life story.

So, the counter?

Go with your instincts.

If I'd gone with my instincts,

I would've finished nursing college.

Another reason I love LA?
We just had brunch at a place

where you can valet park your dog.

Oh, my God, Max, are
those new sunglasses?

Randy got them for me.

I had to. Your other pair of sunglasses

were being held together by willpower,

and four-week-old gum.

Can you have dinner tonight?

Ah, would that mean I have
to have sex with you again?

Because the answer is yes.

Max, you're going out with Randy again?

I've barely seen you since we got here.

And I've seen David
Schwimmer four times.

I've never met David Schwimmer,

which is weird 'cause I'm
pretty sure I'm his lawyer.

Why don't you come to dinner with us?

Would that mean she has
to have sex with you again?

Because that's a yes!

Actually, now I think of it,

I can set you up with
an old friend of mine.

He is big in this town.

Deli-sandwich-named-after-him big.

If you start dating a big sandwich,

I'm gonna be really jealous.

- See you later?
- Hey.

My boobs are down here.

Wear something cute.

Okay.

Last time a guy told you
to wear something cute,

You said, "Like what? Yo nuts?"

You really like this guy.

Oh, can you just not ruin this for me

by pointing out what's good about it?

- Ooh, snacks.
- No, don't eat those.

That's for the meeting with the writers.

Writers are actors who gave
up, so they're allowed to eat.

Can we talk about casting
with these writers?

Because for once, I
want a name to play me,

not just some lady who falls
out of her tube top on "Cops."

Hi, everybody!

Sophie, I thought you
were gonna be at the healer

who's gonna help you get pregnant

until well after our meeting.

Well, you're wrong.

Yeah.

My healer had to cancel.

She's trying to get Kim
Kardashian pregnant again.

Or is it Kanye?

I forget which one's the girl.

I'm pretty sure it's
Kanye, because he's the one

that goes crazy once a month.

This is so exciting. Our
movie meeting is happening!

This is exciting.

I've never been in a hotel meeting

that didn't start on Craigslist.

- Hi!
- Hi, I'm Leslie.

This is Jason. He's my partner.

Writing partner. To be clear,

I only date models.

Hand models, to be clear.

Come on in.

I'm Caroline Channing.

You probably recognize
me from Google Images.

The photo of me being
dragged out of Barneys crying

with my cut up credit cards is classic.

And I'm Max Black. If
you Google Image me,

you'll see the Canadian dude
I stole my identity from.

You're hot. Are you a model?

That is so unprofessional.

Right. Like I'm the one who has to stay

500 feet away from Fred Savage.

He's just so darn cute!

Anyway, hi.

Hi, okay, yeah. Let's
switch focus and sit

and talk movie.

I already came up with my
character's catch phrase.

I think every time I leave
the room, I should say

"Jigga jigga damn."

We thought it was just
gonna be us and Caroline,

not that you're not fun and fabulous.

You're like a sober Megan Fox.

I'm confused. I assumed
you wanted to meet

with both of us because, you know,

Max is a huge part of the story.

Stop texting. Help me.

This is just a boring, preliminary,

get-to-know-you meeting.

- It would really be better if...
- I wasn't here.

Yeah, I get it. I know
when I'm not wanted.

That's why I high-tailed
it out of my mother's womb.

Anyway, I have a big
Hollywood meeting myself.

- You do?
- Uh, yeah.

I have an appointment
to go stand in line

for a little thing called
"The Price Is Right."

You ever heard of it?

Ah, you know you have.

Max, you don't have to go.

It's cool, it's cool.

And with that, let me just say,

jigga jigga damn.

So, here's the thing.

Your friend's character
is not in the movie.

We don't have to do that
"jigga jigga damn" thing.

To be honest, I've
never heard her say that.

Nothing personal to your friend.

- She's hot.
- We get it!

But Jennifer Lawrence is
interested in playing you.

And she wants to do a
brave, no-makeup role.

Without a co-star.

Jennifer Lawrence wants to play me?

Jigga jigga damn!

So you want to sleep over again tonight?

Think your mom will let you?

Maybe. She let me get a job at five.

You guys are sitting on
the same side of the table?

Max, you've kicked people
out of the diner for that!

And it was a boy and his Nana.

I've sat next to
people before at dinner.

They kind of make you at the shelter.

Some wine?

Wine that's not from
a box? That's a yes!

Anyway, how was "The Price Is Right"?

Did you get to meet the host,
I want to say Alex Sajack?

Control that temper, Max.

It's Drew Carey, and
he gets housewives wet

five days a week... know the facts.

But I showed up too late,
so I got to go back tomorrow.

I was thinking of
wearing a shirt that said

"One in the Plinko, two in the stinko."

How about I buy you a
lifetime supply of Rice-A-Roni?

Aw. I don't think you realize
how much Rice-A-Roni I can eat.

Oh, there's Bob.

Bob! We're over here.

Oh, hey there, hot shot.

Is that my date Bob, or a different Bob?

I need that to be a different Bob.

I think that's the very first Bob.

It was Adam, Eve, and Bob.

Caroline, this is Bob.

- Bob, meet Caroline Channing.
- Nice to meet you.

Not a lot on top.

I hope he means I'm stupid.

Wow. If me and Randy are May-December,

you two are May-Dead.

Marlon Brando played the
pants off the Godfather.

You bet your ass he did.

At the end of the day,
he was kissing my ring.

Speaking of kissing,
I haven't gotten one

since that time Bob did
heroin with the Stones.

I think you mean the time the
Stones did heroin with Bob.

Getting any ideas?

Yeah, that I want to die before 60.

Anybody want to do a little blow?

I'm gonna pass. We
have to be careful, Bob.

Some of us are capable of dying.

I'm gonna pass as well.
I don't do snorties.

Even I'm scared of how
much talking there'd be.

Toot, toot. The train is leaving.

Um, Randy?

It was really nice of you to set me up,

but what the hell were you thinking?

There's a 100-year age difference!

Caroline, this is Hollywood.

Age doesn't matter.

Unless you're a woman.

Plus, Bob's got a lot of connections.

He could really help you with your deal.

I'm not gonna sleep with
God's college roommate

to get ahead in Hollywood.

I think sleeping's pretty
much all you'd have to do.

Never got to the blow.

Ran into my fourth
ex-wife, only this time

it wasn't with the moose
bumper on my Range Rover.

You're still driving?

What are you dolls doing in Hollywood?

You girls like a
sister act or something?

Kind of. They're
making a movie about us,

So, what did the writers say?

What did they think about
Zach Galifianakis playing me?

Well, it's nothing personal,

but the writers don't
feel like you're...

It's just, there's so much story.

There's a lot of characters already.

You're out of the picture, kid.

Really? I'm out?

Max, I'm sorry. I told
them you are crucial.

But then they said maybe
Jennifer Lawrence would play me

and I kind of blacked out after that.

Hey, I've been cut out
of a lot of life stories,

like my mom's, every time she met a guy.

I was just her
two-year-old cleaning lady.

Max, this is just the
way Hollywood works.

Bob, you know how Hollywood is.

You were there when it started.

It's cool, it's cool. Randy, you ready?

Yeah, we're gonna take off
before the next story, Bob.

I can only hear about that three-way

with Gavin MacLeod so many times.

Plus, I have to get up early

to get in line for "The Price Is Right."

I used to babysit little Bobby Barker.

Max, don't leave.
Stay for another drink.

Nah, I'm out.

Wow, you could cut that
tension with my coke blade.

Max is tough. We're a team.

We've been through a lot together,

including a car wash that
time our shower broke.

You'll be fine, kid.

You're gonna have plenty of friends

when your movie comes out,

and for six months after that.

I don't need fake friends. I have Max.

That's what Wesley Snipes
said about Jane Fonda.

- They're not friends.
- You bet your ass they're not.

I thought you weren't gonna have time

to be on "The Price Is Right,"

with Caroline's big and
I'm assuming boring movie.

Well, my schedule's wide open.

When it comes to the
movie, I pulled out.

You know, like I always
tell guys I'm going to.

Oh, it's Oleg.

I bet you he wants to have phone sex.

Is there anything I can lean on?

Hey, Sophie.

I was just making some baby back ribs

and I thought, ♪ I want my baby back ♪

Then I pleasured myself
with an oven mitt.

So, no sex?

'Cause I see a bench.
It's a perfect height,

and I can have Max
hold the phone for us.

Is that Sophie? Is she with Max?

Give me that.

It's Han, and you know sounds
even shorter long-distance.

Max, did you play with
the ringtone on my phone?

Every time it rings,
it makes sex sounds.

Mother. I have to call you back.

Sounds like she's doing
just fine on her own.

How do I make the sex sounds stop?

For you, it's a rare occurrence.

Just leave it in your
pants and enjoy it.

- So, Max...
- Sorry, Han.

I can't hear you. I'm
driving through the hills.

I'm... breaking... up aah... ahh...

I'm coming, Mother!

Ooh, here comes the contestant picker.

Act like you're a stay-at-home
mom from the Midwest.

That's the "Price Is Right" sweet spot.

Okay, how's this?

Oh, God.

Those little bastards are
just running me ragged.

Pick me! Pick me!

We got a lot of 12-year-old
boys playing sick at home.

How long can you ladies
jump up and down for?

- 20 minutes.
- Step out of line.

What is that costume?

Oh, this is home-bedazzled, doncha know?

Step out of line.

I'm just glad to be out of the house.

Wait here. You're both in the mix.

Practice being excited
to meet Drew Carey.

He knows when you're faking it.

My Bob never knows when I'm faking it.

Keep it up. I like your pepper.

Max! I've been looking all over for you.

What are you doing here?

This isn't a scene in the movie.

I know, because I'm in it.

Max, there would be
no movie without you.

There would also be no armed
guards at HomeTown Buffet.

What's your point?

I would've been here sooner,

but I just got back from Vegas with Bob.

He lost $50,000,

and somehow Faye Dunaway's Oscar.

But Bob and I talked a lot about
friendship on the helicopter.

You know, right after
I jump-started his heart

with the epi pen.

And you and I are not gonna be

Winona Ryder and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Or Sophie and Gwyneth Paltrow!

That bitch.

I was going to name
my first-born "Apple,"

and she took it.

Now I have to settle for "Fritter."

I am not gonna sell out our
friendship for Hollywood.

Max, you're in the movie
and you're coming with me

to the meeting to tell them that.

But I'm in the mix. They
actually want me here.

But I want you there.

I'm the stupid you should be with.

All right, screw it.

Sophie, I'm gonna go with her.

Why stop making bad decisions now?

All right, but I'm gonna have
to make another friend in line.

Hi, I'm Barb.

Oh, gosh, carpool and fluffernutter...

because soccer, right?

Max, this is kind of our
first Hollywood party.

I know. I wonder who I'll go home with.

Probably Andrew Dice Clay again.

Hey listen, this might be

the sixth teeny, tiny, tequila talking,

but thanks for standing up for me

and not letting those writers
cut me out of your life.

Oh, Max, that means a lot.

I love it when you're drunk and nice.

Oh, no, it's Han.

Wonder what he wants.

You think he finally realized

I changed the outgoing
message on the diner

to "Welcome to Diarrhea-ville?"

Max, I heard the outgoing message,

and I found a series of Home
Alone-style traps in my office,

each one more fiendishly
clever than the last.

And I don't know how you got
those goats in his office,

but we're having a hard
time getting them out.

What's next, Max?

What will finally bring me to my knees?

I don't know. A guy who
kind of looks like a girl?

Why are you doing all of this to me?

I just didn't want you to
forget me while I was away.

- Aw!
- Oh, Max.

Now you've brought me to tears.

Aah!

Congratulations, Max.

You finally got his goat.

Whoo! Aah!

Somebody help me!

Cover those nuts.

You may need them one day.

I like that you're a bi-coastal bully.

That might be our sequel.

Oh, I forgot to tell you.

I invited a couple of guys over.

Who? I'm kind of seeing someone-ish.

It's Randy and Bob.

Bob was real?

I thought he was a ghost.

Hey, girls. I brought some bubbly

to celebrate your victory today,

and Bob brought a wide variety
of opiates and stimulants.

Oh, I'm glad to see
you two stuck it out.

True friendship is a rare thing.

There's only one man I've ever trusted,

and that is Anjelica Huston.

Holy crap!

I think God is here for Bob.

Is that chopper for you?

You bet your ass it is.

I'm going to Malibu.

Susan Sarandon is ordering pizza.

We're doing molly.

Bob.

Will I ever see you again?

Slow down, pussycat. I'm
just getting out of something.

That man sure knows how to make an exit.

Not from life, but from everything else.

I gotta go, doll.

Bob's gonna drop me off at home.

Hopefully, I'll land
in my pool this time.

I don't know what it is,
but I'm crazy about Bob.

Get it, girl.


Okay, Max, here are the paint
chips for our new dessert bar.

Don't eat them. This
isn't your childhood.

These are all pink.

You want the walls of
our bar to be all pink?

It'll be the first time someone drinks

after they enter a vagina.

Oh, hey... no vagina in the Dina.

Or your apartment. Ever.

You know, this isn't Hooters.

The v-bomb isn't usually
batted around the workplace.

Speaking of batting things around,

our cat wants you to come over again.

Yesterday you said your cat

was too cool to hang out with me.

So which is it?

'Cause I am free tonight.

Hey, everybody!

You know what today is?

I hope it ain't the 15th,

'cause that means I missed dialysis.

No, I'm 20 weeks preggers.

And it's time for Oleg and
I to choose the godparents.

You know, it's an old Polish tradition.

Like pierogies and public hangings.

Godparents?

God didn't even give
me parents-parents.

He just gave me some lady that
took me home from the hospital

in a Blockbuster Video bag.

It's a big decision.

You have to pick a couple
who would raise the child

with your beliefs and values.

And Hugh Hefner and whoever he's banging

already said no.

Yeah, so I'm making a list.

But Oleg doesn't want anyone in prison.

You know, so that knocks out
most of the women in my family.

You know, you guys could also have

these conversations at home.

But this counter is
where they made the baby.

Hey, Earl.

Oh, good, I need somebody strong.

Uh, would you carry this over there,

put some coffee in it,

and bring it back to me?

I'll hot this up in a second.

Just let me hot this one up first.

What're you doing here?

I know you don't like me to bother you

during your free time,

but I missed you.

And I want to tell you
something in person.

Well, whatever it is,
I probably have it too.

And I probably had it first.

It's not that.

But now I'm worried.

No, I met with this
law firm in Manhattan,

and they want to make me a partner.

They're making you a partner?

Well, then they're gonna catch it too.

So, Randy,

you really are a lawyer?

I thought you just played
lawyers in gay porn.

Thanks.

I will tell my trainer.

He was in gay porn.

Hey, Buzz Lightyear,

I'm still waiting for that coffee.

All right, well, I'll be in my booth

working on my godparent list.

And whoever we pick
should be like one of those

perfect families on TV
like, well, the Brady's,

and the Huxtables...

Or, you know what?
Scratch that last one.

Wow, if you're considering
moving to New York,

it must be a pretty good job.

Well, there's a couple other reasons.

The bagels.

I have tickets to
Hamilton in seven years.

And there's this girl
here I kind of like.

Who is she? I'll kill her.

So two of the partners want
to take me out tomorrow night

to some fancy private dinner
at someplace called Beak.

You're going to Beak?

It's hidden away in a private apartment,

practically under the
Williamsburg Bridge,

so you pretty much have to walk.

How awful and chic is that?

I read in Time Out that
that place is so exclusive,

it's technically not even a restaurant.

Big deal.

This diner gets called "not
a restaurant" all the time.

Hey, did they tell
you to just bring Max,

or was it more of a "bring whoever"?

- Um...
- I'll take that as a yes.

I'd love to join you
at Beak tomorrow night.

How could I say no to Beak?

It's spring, so that's peak Beak.

So you want to go?

Want to be my date?

Nah, pass.

Fancy restaurants are one of
the three things I don't do.

You know the other two.

Didn't we blow past those week one?

Max, are you crazy?

Why, is one of my
pupils getting all small?

It happens now. I don't know why.

What was that out there?

"Nah, pass."

Randy's not just asking
you to dinner-dinner.

This isn't about food.

It's about your future together.

He's moving here for you.

You just "naw pass" -ed on Randy.

Weird, I didn't love your
impression the first time,

but I loved it the second.

Randy's moving here for a job.

This dinner isn't
about some law partners.

It's about you and him as partners.

Do you hear words I don't?

You're going to that dinner,
young lady, end of discussion.

Oh, that was so mom-ish!

I wouldn't know. I've never met one.

Oh, good, this is it.

We knocked on another apartment door,

but the only thing they
were cooking was meth.

We walked across a bridge for this?

This is basically my apartment,
except our wild birds are alive.

Randy, you made it.

And I mean, you made it
because you're eating at Beak.

I mean, the wait list here is longer

than an episode of HBO's Vinyl.

Max, this is Marissa,
one of the partners.

Marissa, this is Max.

She's my girlfriend.

Max? Cute.

Is that short for Maxine?

Technically, it's long for "meh."

Sorry, I don't get it.

Probably because of the
Klonopin I had to take

when that homeless man tried
to talk to me on the way in.

Uh, Max, this is Leila,
another partner at the firm,

and her wife, Lei.

She's not just my wife. She's
also a star on Instagram.

See? I talk about your accomplishments.

I put wigs on statues

and then photograph them from behind.

That's it?

That's it.

Max...

are you a lawyer too?

Uh, no, but I presided over
a food court or two in my day.

Max and her partner,
Caroline, are in the process

of opening a dessert bar.

And I don't mean "partner"
in the romantic sense.

I've got that department covered.

Well, welcome, Randy and Max.

You know, I've been
hoping to add another

straight couple to the law firm mix,

but, you know, they're
so hard to find nowadays.

Lei and I met on an

Orange is the New Black message board.

It's kind of become the lesbian Tinder.

Uh, Randy, wasn't
there rumor of a third?

Oh, I keep pitching that,
but he "likes me too much."

Again, don't quite get it.

Little hazy.

Well, I'll have to tell
the chef he's preparing

oyster foam for six.

I'm sorry, "oyster foam"?

Foam from an oyster?

That sounds delicious.

I know your idea of fine dining
is a ham and cheese Hot Pocket,

but I am really glad you came.

Oh, here's Lenin.

Um, Randy, Max, this is Lenin.

He's the chef. And my lover.

We have sex too.

Lei and I are "post sex."

All intimacy, no penetration.

I'll be serving a meal of
seven bird-themed courses,

each one it's own
unique flight of fancy.

Not my words, a very
giggly Anderson Cooper.

Now, before we begin, do either of you

have any food allergies?

Just one: birds.

I don't get her, either.

Let's all sit.

Max.

Why do you want me to sit
that far from the table?

That's me being polite.

You are in for such a treat.

Lenin is a real artist.

He spends all day
making these teeny-tiny,

delicate little meals,
which is why I pay our rent.

Our first course is a French delicacy.

The Ortolan Bunting bird,
roasted and eaten whole.

Just grasp the bird by its head
and start eating at the feet.

Enjoy. Obviously.

Can't wait to get that
bird foot in my mouth.

How's the baby pigeon
and oyster foam, Max?

Oh, delicious.

It's amazing how full
babies can make you.

No, Lei, way too many photos

of me eating foam.

Like a rabid dog.

Oh, good. This is it.

The guy who opened the
other apartment door

wasn't wearing pants.

Or underwear.

Or was circumcised.

Hi! I'm here.

What did I miss?

The point of literally
every movie we see together.

Marissa, this is Caroline,
Max's business partner.

She texted she was coming.

She's usually not covered
in this much sweat.

Sorry, I had to run across the bridge,

'cause you need a credit card
for one of those city bikes.

Um, if I had a credit card,

why would I be riding a damn bike?

I'm at Beak. I'm trendy again!

Fifth course.

Tiny poached noisy
scrubbird with fiddle ferns

and fermented egg.

Oh, that sounds so
gross. I bet it's great.

Max, eat.

I sure will.

When I used to watch Tweety Bird,

all I could think was,
"God, that looks delicious."

You're doing great.

Who wants some more wine?

I'm guessing Max.

I can't believe we're here,

eating the finest...
what'd he say this was?

Blue jay?

Aren't you proud of me?

I got through the first four courses.

That's more courses than
I finished in high school.

Oh, look at this pretentious,

deliberately relaxed large napkin.

Love it and hate it.

What is that?

This first four courses!

I cheated, like in high school!

I couldn't eat it; it's gross.

No, gross is when you
hand the guy at Del Taco

65 cents and tell him to surprise you.

You are judging me for
not eating most of my

Saturday morning cartoon lineup?

You want to chomp down
on Foghorn Leghorn?

When a great guy like Randy
is moving to New York for you,

yes, you have to eat
your childhood favorites!

Anyone like to come see the de-spining

of the tiny trumpeter bird?

This could push me over
a million followers.

I can't eat that, Caroline.

And I have nowhere to put it.

My bra is at crazy capacity.

The fire marshal almost
kicked out my left boob.

Why can't you just try it?

You've had worse things in your mouth.

He's moving here to be with you.

He's moving here for a job.

Look, whatever comes next,
just put it in your mouth

and eat it.

Well, I did not know the
bird was gonna be alive.

Worst part? Making eye contact.

Creamed kimchi and pelican tongue

with Asian pear.

Enjoy.

The least you can do is
swallow a little tongue.

Tongue swallowing? Foam?

This isn't a restaurant;
it's a heroin overdose.

I love you.

Good for you, Max!

This is real growth.

Is it bad I feel like the
tongue is tasting me back?

Max, you look sweaty.

Like when you try to do math.

I think that tongue
is looking for an exit.

Randy, we're really excited
for you to come work with us.

How fast can you move to New York?

Not as fast as I have
to get to that bathroom.

Excuse us,

we have to go to the
little sparrow's room.

Nope, it's cool, false alarm.

Nope, real alarm. Very real alarm.

- Should I come in with you?
- No!

Even I don't want to go in there!

I doubt this door is
soundproof, so talk loud.

Just start with your normal volume,

and then dial it down a notch.

Oh, Marissa!

You have to tell me where you
found these fabulous glasses.

Restoration Hardware?

Crate and Barrel?

Restoration Hardware Modern?

West Elm? CB2?

CB3? Is there one of those yet?

You know what?

Let's get some music going!

Like some really loud dubstep,

'cause I'm running out of breath.

Oh, there's no music allowed here.

It would get in the way of
hearing the symphony of taste.

Not my words.

Okay, they were my words.

I think I'd like to make a toast.

Oh, no, please don't make a toast.

I've begun not to like you.

Seriously, Lenin.

Not even a little light piano?

You don't need to reinvent
the freaking wheel here.

Hey, Caroline, please. Just sit.

You know what, I see if
I have another Klonopin.

- I'm fine.
- It's not for you.

Caroline.

Should I go in there?

'Cause I am not hearing the standard

tinkle and a hand wash.

No, don't move. Stay there.

That noise is just the
pipes backing up a little.

Well, a lot.

Oh, Lord!

They're young.

My camera needs to be in there.

Enough with the camera!

I'm alive!

Max.

Where are you going?

Anywhere but here!

Max, seriously!

What's going on in there?

Everything's okay in here!

We'll be out in a minute.

If you're not gonna
let me in, at least...

Max!

Wait up!

You don't have to be
embarrassed in front of me.

I've seen worse.

Okay, no I haven't.

Just go away!

I can't take that sad look.

It's the same look you gave Chestnut

that time he crapped on the couch.

I'm fine alone; you
didn't have to leave.

No, I did.

They couldn't possibly think one person

was responsible for all that.

Plus, I don't want to leave you.

You're sick.

I think it's beyond sick.

I lost bone mass in there.

My shoes are too big now.

I'm so embarrassed!

Hey, it happens.

You got a stomach ache.

You're just not used to rich food.

I'm not used to rich anything.

And if this is Randy's world...

uh, bird bones and pretentious people...

then maybe my body is
telling me I can't take it.

Max, if I got used to
buying earrings at the AMPM,

you can get used to fancy
food and pretentious people.

You don't get it!

He is moving here for me.

Oh, do you think so?

I wish your best friend

had been telling you that for two days.

He's moving his whole life.

I don't know how to do that.

I didn't even know how to react
when he moved my chair for me.

You were right, it's not about the food;

it's about our future,
and I just vomited

all over our future.

What?

I hate to say this, but you need a mint.

Sorry, I love you, but you need a mint.

I need to disappear.

What do you think of
the name Sheila Newman?

Max!

Randy.

Great, just in time to see me jump.

What happened? Where'd you go?

Oh, I jumped on that bike so fast,

my man parts are no
longer talking to me.

She didn't want to be
sick in front of you.

You got sick?

Okay, fine, we all heard it.

But why did you leave
without saying something?

Because words were the only thing

not coming out of my mouth.

Max?

You're not gonna look at me?

I can't.

Wait, here.

Now she can.

You better get back there.

I don't want you to lose that job.

I don't want that job.

I don't know how many
more pills Marissa took,

but she passed out in
a pot of clam steam.

I missed clam steam?

I've been reading about his clam steam.

Please stop saying "clam steam."

I can actually smell the words.

Okay, Max.

You are starting to turn green again,

so why don't you hop on,
and I will ride you home

on my bicycle like a real man.

I don't know, Randy.

A lot of stuff came up
for me at that dinner.

And I'm not just talking about

every single thing I ate this year.

I mean, maybe I'm not right for you.

Hey.

Don't be so hard on
yourself about tonight.

I mean, look at me.

I'm not brave enough
to eat in that diner.

Come here, you.

Maybe wait another 60 seconds.

I think we are different.

But we kind of go together.

Like peppered baby
bird bladder and pesto.

Oh, no.

Oh, my God.

That's gonna do it!

Wrong night to be driving a convertible.

Oh, wait... no, no, no, no, no, no.

So how's your first diner burger?

It's not bad.

I'm getting a little something.

Um... mesquite?

Yeah, they die in the fan
and then fall on the grill.

I'll take mosquito burger
over pelican any day.

Interesting, Randy.

You get two waitresses
paying attention to you

and most people get none.

Like that one over there,

over there, and that
gentleman over there

who's just giving up and leaving.

Fine, Han, we will
go over to the counter

and continue to talk.

I know I say a lot of stuff about you,

especially to your face,

but thank you for your help last night.

I know you would have
done the same thing for me.

But if I ever get that sick,

you have my permission to kill me.

I mean, when you went into that
toilet, looking for my earring,

I knew I had found my post-sex partner.

You did that for her?

Wow!

And all this time,
we've been looking for

the perfect couple to be godparents,

and they're right under our noses.

Girl-on-girl godparents.

I like it.

You two girls are gonna
be great with the baby.

I mean, Caroline,

you were elbow-deep in Max's upchuck.

I mean, I wouldn't even
do that for my own father

when he swallowed all those bees.

Wow, Sophie, this is
such a huge compliment.

Tucked away in a
terrible personal memory.

Well, if something
would ever happen to us,

let Max do the breast feeding.

'Cause, yeah, I don't
want the kid to starve.

This is exciting!

Randy, I'm gonna be a godfather.

And equally as exciting,

I'm gonna be climbing out
of that bathroom window

in about two minutes.

Max.

It's the woman at table 2's 50th birthday
and her husband wants us to sing to her.

If I had a dollar every time a man
asked me to do something to his wife,

I'd be a millionaire.

I remember when
Happy Birthday first came up.

I never thought it would catch on.

Go!

And smile.

When you fake smile,

everybody else fakes smile back.

Nobody wants to hear that lame song.

If we want to humiliate her in public, why
don't we go over there and pull her top down?

Come on, let's just go sing
and make the best of it.

Ready?

One, two, three...

♪ Happy birthday to you...♪

Whoa!

I apologize.

It's hard enough your husband took you
to a diner on your birthday

and now you have to listen to white Mariah?

No!

Happy ***.

♪ To yoooooooou ♪

I have announcement to make.

I agree with what Max said before.

What? That we should tie
a little bell around you,

so we know when you're near?

The diner needs a fresh, new way

to celebrate the customer birthday.

So I just went
and wrote a special song.

Han, I'd be happy to look
at what you've written so far.

I took music theory in college.

I once wrote
an entire original musical

based on the French revolution.

Um, sorry to step on your nerd turf,

but Les Mis is already a musical
about the French revolution.

Yes, but mine was from
the point of view of the rich.

What are you going
to rewrite next--

the musical rent from the point
of view of the landlord?

Han, this is
a lovely start, but--

But not good enough.

I know what you are saying.

"You need to practice more, Han.

"You never will be
as good as your sister, Han.

"Whole family going on vacation

without you
while you practice, Han."

Back off, tiger mom!

Hey, Caroline, is Max around?

Um, she might be.
I'll go check.

You'll never guess who
just came into the restaurant.

You'll be very happy.

Gary, the fat guy from teen mom?

Someone you like,
someone you want to kiss,

someone you're hot for.

Tyler, the skinny guy from teen mom?

What's Johnny doing here?

I told him not
to show his face unless--

Unless he broke up
with his girlfriend.

And now he's here, showing his face,

- which means--
- You can't know that for sure.

Fine. Tell me one other reason
he could possibly be in here.

He needs Han to solve
a complex math problem?

Max!

Max, it's pretty obvious
that he's in here

because he broke up
with his girlfriend "Cassandra"

I mean, what else could it be?

When I had millions of dollars,

I had no idea
why guys were coming to see me.

"Do they want me,
or do they want my money?"

But you have nothing!

So basically that just leaves you.

Way to puff me up
before I go through that door.

This is so exciting.

Will you stop?
Don't be such a girl.

Hair? Teeth? Anything?

You're good.

Wait.

More.

- Really?
- Trust me.

Oh, uh, hey, Johnny.
When did you get here?

Uh, just now.

I, uh--I came here

because I want to tell you something.

Yes?

Max, I think you and I
have something special.

And I don't want to lose that.

So I came down here to ask...

Even though it didn't work out,

can we still be friends?

- Oh.
- What?

You have got to be kidding!

Oh.

What's going on over there, Caroline?

My friend Johnny and I have no idea

what you're upset about.

I was just reacting to the
news that we're out of pie.

I really cannot believe it.

I totally thought it would go
a different way.

Caroline...

Why don't you go over there
to the pie carrousel

and mourn the loss of our pie?

So, we're cool?

Yeah, we're cool.
Why wouldn't we be?

We never dated or anything like that.

Of course we're friends.

I am so relieved.

So, uh, you gonna go back

to busting my balls, like always?

Yes.

We're such good friends,
I might just...

Bust them with my feet!

Good morning.

I'm trying to send out
a get-to-know-us email blast

for the cupcake business.

But your wi-fi is so slow.

Don't tell me--
tell cathyhome17,

whoever and wherever she is.

Okay, well, I'm just going

to run down to the coffee place
and send it.

Do you approve?

Nice job.
The font's pretty.

You just gave me a compliment?

I knew it--
you're depressed.

You're so depressed

about you and Johnny
just being friends,

you don't even have the energy
to be you.

What?
The font is pretty.

Oh, honey, do you want a hug?

- I'm fine.
- How could you be fine?

The man was so into you,

he painted a billboard
of the two of you kissing.

And now he just wants to be friends?

Please call in sick
to your babysitting job

and take to the bed.

Whenever I used to get depressed,

I'd take to the bed.

One time, I took to the bed
for a week.

Listen, unlike you, Jane Austen,

I will never take to the bed.

Giving into feelings
is for rich people.

Regular people just have to get up,

get drunk, and go fulfill
their babysitting duties.

Max, take to the bed.

Look, this is my pattern, okay?

I fall for the wrong guy,

I find out they're with a girl,
a bottle, or a needle,

and I move on.

And sometimes I use a bottle
to help me do it...

Or a needle or a girl.

But when I'm done, I'm done.

That's it?

You're just over it?

Wow.

I'm still sad because
Kyle Enright didn't invite me

on his private jet to Mykonos
for his 12th birthday.

Well, not me.

Just flip a switch
and those feelings are gone.

I only have two switches
in my life--

one turns off my emotions,

the other makes a car bounce.

Okay, I better go.

If you get there after 10:30,
you can't hear yourself think

over the sounds of people
skyping to the Philippines.

Max, are you sure you're all right?

Max.

Are you about to come
over here and soft-touch me?

- I want to so bad.
- Leave!

Go to the coffee place.
Soft-touch the barista.

Excuse me, miss.

You keep your door open like that,

this rat's probably
going to get inside.

Don't worry. You should see
the size of my cat.

What are you doing here?

I knew you'd be home for another hour,

so I brought you coffee.

And I wanted to say...

Thanks for understanding
the situation.

Hey, you don't need to get all

"Hallmark presents:
Johnny Soft Eyes" on me.

Okay?
You're not my type, anyway.

You're a bartender
who's close to liquor all night

and your not an alcoholic.

So clearly you don't know
how to seize an opportunity.

Yes, I do.

This is where you join
in birthday song

with your sweet-ass saxophone.

Han, I like you, brother,

but I played with everyone

from Marvin Gaye to the gay Marvins.

They never made it--a little bit
ahead of their time.

But if you don't mind
a professional opinion, man,

you've got to put some heart
into this thing.

But my mother always say
to run away from heart--

only the head can make music.

Han, your mother sounds
like one cold--

Don't you talk about my mama!

Hey, Earl.
What's up?

I just got threatened

by a man who gets carded
at Pixar movies.

Max, great news--

that email blast I sent out
this morning worked.

I just got us a big cupcake job

at some event place
called the gold space loft.

Last time I was
at the gold space loft,

I went to a poetry slam,
and I wound up slamming a poet.

They need 100 cupcakes
by tomorrow night.

And because I'm a genius,

and also because
it's such short notice--

but mostly
because I'm a genius--

I got them up to $500.

It's a cool
group art show--

very Williamsburg, very pot brownie.

And Johnny has a piece in it.

And since you flipped your switch,

I figured it'd be fine.

No way. I can't make
100 cupcakes in a day.

Max, I know it's a lot of work,

but I'll do whatever I can to help.

This is a really big
opportunity for us.

I kissed Johnny.

What? When?

He came by the apartment
right after you left.

I was only gone 20 minutes.

What'd you do--shine
a bat symbol on your vagina?

Stop acting like
I wanted it to happen.

I didn't want it to happen.
I'm lucky we just kissed.

My pants kept saying,
"Take me off!"

And I'm like,
"No, pants."

I'm telling you,
I almost couldn't help myself.

I don't understand.

I thought you said
you were done with him.

What happened to your pattern?

Telling people I have a
pattern is part of the pattern.

Then I just go and do whatever I want.

I knew it, it thought it,
I should have said it--

girls cannot be friends with guys.

Yeah, well, you also knew
he was coming in here

to tell me he broke up
with his girlfriend.

So you can suck it.

Did he say he was going
to break up with her?

We didn't get into it.

We weren't really using
our mouths for talking.

What do you think's going to happen?

I don't know.

All I know is it's not going
to happen at a public art show

in front of him
and his beautiful, cool

British girlfriend.

Max, you don't even have to see them.

We'll get there early,
we'll drop off the cupcakes,

and be gone before any
of the artists even show up.

Great.
I'm going home tonight

after my ten-hour
waitress shift,

to stay up all night
and bake 100 cupcakes

for a guy I kissed
who has a girlfriend.

Beep.

Ooh, what's that?
My self-esteem just flatlined.

Yeah, it's this way.

I smell patchouli and pretension.

Why are you walking so slow?

Because I'm carrying
our cupcake future,

and I don't want half
of our future's frosting

to be on top of the box.

Relax.
We still have time.

Oh, hello.

Welcome to space blast art attack.

The gallery won't be open
for, like, an hour.

Actually, we're here
delivering the cupcakes.

We're looking for someone
named Traivor.

And I'm looking for Traivor's mom,

to ask her why
she named a person Traivor.

Traive!

You girls can set up inside.

He's the one
with the super-tall hat.

I love galleries.

My father and I had an art foundation.

We taught blind kids
how to do ceramics.

Why didn't you just buy them eyes?

Let's put them here.

This art show is ridiculous--

someone named Traivor,

a dreamcatcher
with buzzwords stuck in it.

And you.

Why would he hang that picture of us

if he still has a girlfriend?

Maybe he went home
and broke up with her

after he kissed you.

The writing is literally on the wall.

Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for you again.

Let's just get our money and go.

Oh, uh...

Grown lady dressed like a doll,

we can't find tall hat,

and we need to get paid
for the cupcakes and leave.

Leave?
What are you talking about.

- You're serving the cupcakes.
- Pardon?

Well, why do you think we're
paying you $500 for cupcakes?

Because my friend's a genius.

This is new information.

We need to talk to someone.
Traive!

Oh, no. Traive is busy
installing his ice penis.

I could get someone else
on the show committee to help.

Cashandra!

What's his girlfriend doing here?

- Oh, God!

What if soft eyes wussed out
and told her what happened?

- Does she look mad?
- No, she looks amazing.

Max, hello.

We met that one time on the street.

Cashandra, Johnny's girlfriend.

Oh, hi, hi.
I'm Johnny's friend.

We're just friends.

Hi, "Cassandra."
I'm Caroline.

I was with Max on the street.

And all day yesterday.

We were together every minute.

It's Cash-andra, actually.

But everyone calls me Cash.

And you're Max's
business partner, right?

Yeah, but she makes her own decisions.

Right. Well, let's just
get to it, shall we?

I'm a bleeder.

It's brilliant it all worked out

- with the cupcakes.
- Excuse me?

Well, I told Traive
to hire you for the show.

Johnny cannot stop talking
about your cupcakes, Max.

"Max's cupcakes are so moist."

"Max's cupcakes are delicious."

He loves your cupcakes.

Yeah, yeah.

But just like in a casual way.

I mean, he barely even touched them.

So, um, I'm a bit busy
getting ready for the show.

Why don't you put your little
cupcakes on these trays,

and when people start coming in,
circulate, right?

Circulate, girls, circulate.

Well, that wasn't uncomfortable.

Come on, let's bolt
before Johnny gets here,

while I at least have
a shred of my dignity.

We can't just bail out
of our first big job.

If we do,
people will think we're flakes.

And that'll spread faster
through Williamsburg

than knit hats and herpes.

Hey, you ladies know
where the wine goes?

- Oh--
- Right here.

Yeah.

No! Just, uh, not the wine.
The wine's mine.

Just serving cupcakes.

I've been listening in on Cashandra

and her girlfriends' conversations,

and I don't think she knows
anything happened

between you two.

I also learned she's a dancer,

her lip gloss is from Kiehl's,

and she's school chums with Adele.

Not the Adele.

Damn it!
Could she be any cooler?

I want her to be my girlfriend.

I wouldn't break up with her for me.

Hi. I'm here.

Great. I was hoping
tonight would get weirder.

I had no idea.

She did it to surprise me.

And she did--
I'm surprised.

I am so sorry.

You have a girlfriend.
Why are you kissing Max?

You told her?

Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

Would the more subtle way
be to paint a picture

and hang it on the wall
for all to see?

Are you insane?

Could we have a moment, please?

Fine.

I'll be over there near the ice penis.

Look, I am so sorry.

If I had known Cash was going
to ask you to do all of this,

I would have told you.

And why would you choose to hang that?

'Cause it's my favorite piece.

Is there any way
she could know what happened?

No.

- Oh, my God. Your lips.
- Split up.

I can smell the sex
from across the room.

No-whoa-whoa!
I need all those.

So what?
Is she still your girlfriend?

Max, it's complicated.

What, are we on Facebook?

It is complicated.

Cash and I have been together
two years,

- and when--
- Two years?

Jeez, I'm a home wrecker.

Adele will probably write
a song about me.

You're not a homewrecker.

- I am.
- Johnny!

You've got some folks.

Circulate, Max, circulate.

That's it.
This is over.

That--us on the wall--
never happens again.

I lied.
I can't be your friend.

I was trying to be cool,
but I'm not cool.

I don't know Adele.

What just happened over there?
Did he tell you

he's breaking up with his girlfriend?

No.
What's wrong with you?

You haven't been right about anything?

I told him we are done,
and that's over, okay?

They've been together two years.

And I know one thing about me--
I may pick the wrong guys,

but when I hear
another woman is involved,

I am done.

This is truly the end of my pattern.

We have to go--
I kissed Johnny again.

What?
Max, you said

you were going to the bathroom.

I did.
And so did he.

It's a unisex bathroom--

emphasis on the sex.

We have to go.

I'm a little drunk and out of control.

Traive said we won't get paid

until every single one
of the cupcakes is gone.

- So we're stuck here.
- Fine.

I shall go circulate.

No. You cannot be trusted.

Next thing I know, you'll be
doing him behind the ice penis.

I'm telling you, I am done.

You told me that five minutes ago.

Well, you told me he was breaking up

with his girlfriend three times.

So I guess we learned tonight
that you know nothing about him,

and I know nothing about me.

Cheers!

Wait for me.

Hello, girls.

Traivor told me
you were looking to get paid.

But just to be clear,
you can't actually be paid

until all the cupcakes are gone.

And do me a favor, love,

put a chocolate aside for Johnny.

He loves chocolate.

He'll eat a vanilla if it's available,

but he always goes back to chocolate.

I don't think he's going
to break up with her.

Really?

You have the accuracy rate
of a magic 8 ball.

Look at her.
She's so pretty.

And bitchy.
And...

More pretty than bitchy.

Oh, God.
She just zipped his hoodie

and fixed his hair--
that's a couple.

What they have is real.

They are a couple--
Johnny and Cash.

Oh-ho, crap!
Johnny Cash!

They're an institution.

I never had a chance.

Forget the money--
let's just go.

Mm-mmm.

We are staying till
these cupcakes are gone.

I am not leaving
with no dignity and no money.

Fine, I'll circulate
a couple more times.

Wait a minute.

They said they had to be gone,

but they didn't say
who had to make them gone.

We eat them and go!

You're doing it!
I rescued you from the gutter.

Uh, well, that's
not entirely accura--

Mm-hmm!

Mmm, mmm.

Max, wake up.

It's 3:00.

We forgot to set the alarm.

Oh, I never thought waking up in bed

with another woman
with...Frosting on my boobs,

would be this depressing.

How are you feeling
about it all today?

Do you want to talk?

- No.
- Good.

Where's your purse?

I'm going to take some
of the money we made last night

and get coffee.
And yes--

I am walking down the street
like this,

because after last night,
I am impenetrable to shame.

Wait, we don't have any money.

- Yes, we do.
- No, we don't.

We did, but we don't.

I bought something with it.

I bought this.

You carried that home?
Where was I?

Three blocks ahead of me,

telling strangers about your pattern.

I saw you and Johnny
just hanging there,

and I knew what I had to do.

So what, am I supposed
to hang that up?

No. You're supposed
to destroy it.

You need to get over him,
so you're going to kick this,

and then you're going
to kick him once and for all.

You want to break your pattern?

Start by breaking the painting.

That is a complete waste of money.

I may have been wrong about
everything else about Johnny,

but I'm right about this.
Come on.

Kick it.

I can't.

- Give me your foot.
- What?

Lift up your leg.

Yay! You did it.

Good for you!

You broke a painting
and maybe your pattern.

I really liked him.

I know.

Well?

I slept through my day job,
so what the heck?

I think I will take to the bed
or whatever.

Just for like 20 minutes.

I'll set my alarm and then I'll get up

and get ready for work.

Max, please,
I feel like we need a hug.

We just slept together!
You women are so needy.

How could ketchup get this hard?

You just hold it in your hand like this, and say

You are the biggest ketchup I've ever had.

Hey, everybody. I got it, I got it.

Don't panic. At least you caught it in the early stage.

No, I got the papers so we can see if our ticket win the lottery.

120 million dollars.

Fun! If we win, I'll get an eighth of my trust fund back.

Come on. Now, who's got our ticket?

I've got the ticket. I put it in here.

I figured it's where everybody else gets lucky.

By the way, if we win,

I'm gonna buy a condo right next to Great Adventure and go there everyday drunk.

Also put a soda fridge in my garage fo sho (for sure).

Earl, what are you gonna do with your share if we win?

Well, I'll get out of this club chop as fast as I can,

and set me up with some kind of a Hugh Hefner  situation.

Here we go, for the big money.

Woo. If I win, hello Netflix subscription.

We need a six, a ten, a five, a 12 and a nine.

And the first number is��6!

And the second number is 47.

Good thing I didn't pay my share of the tickets yet, suckers!

Before I forget, I printed up more of our cupcake business cards

So we can hand them out at the Williamsburg crafts fair.

Oh, can't wait

Me and you handing out free cupcakes

stuck between hipsters selling crochet

iPad sleeves and Salt-n-Pepa Salt and Pepper Shakers.

We are not just giving them away for free. It's marketing.

One person eats it and spreads it around their friends.

So we are herpes.

Hello, Sophie.

If you looked any sweeter, you would fire up my diabetes.

Oh, Earl. You wouldn't be the first man to lose a limb over me.

Sophie, I'm surprised to see you in here.

Stutter buzz says you and Oleg are no longer together.

Wow, this little girl likes to gossip. Yes?

Won't you scutter your little butt over there

Come see me in my booth.

Are we over here so Oleg can't see you through the kitchen window?

What is this? Diner or back issue of Cosmopolitan magazines?

I grew up reading Cosmo.

I mean, what a six-year-old doesn't need to know? The hidden male erogenous zones.

It's the nipples, the end.

I came to give you girls a cleaning job tomorrow.

We can't tomorrow. We are doing the crafts fair.

We are turning down a real paying job to go to the crap fair?

Yes, it's important that we focus on the cupcake business.

And you can't spell "focus" without "us".

Or FU.

Hello, Sophie.

Hello, Oleg.

So, do you miss the sex?

Oh, you know what? We should go.

No. We are having a conversation here.

And besides, the sex was not that good.

Oh, it was that good.

It wasn't that good.

Please, I beg you. Let us go.

You can go. I'm kind of into it.

Like, it's like a dirty Downton Abbey.

So why are you still standing there

giving me those sad, cow eyes

in that brown velure.

Because it's a good look on me.

And because I'm waiting for you to admit that you came here

because you miss the sex.

I miss summers in Minsk.

I miss smoking in hospitals.

But I don't miss the sex.

Fine, then. What would you like to eat?

I'll have my usual sausage.

Ok, ding. It's ready.

Max's homemade cupcakes.

Max's delicious homemade cupcakes

- Let's move this along. Max's homemade cupcakes.

Max, come on. Could you at least try and have a better attitude at the crafts fair?

I was doing fine until my hair got gang feather by that girl from that church of good vibes.

Hi!

I'm from the Funnel Cake booth back there

and your little table is sadder than watching the notebook at a funeral.

Hey Dutch girl,

why don't you go stick your finger in a dyke.

I'm sure you can find one over near the plus sized denim.

Max, please. We are all business woman here.

Yeah. Some of us wearing table cloth on their heads.

Just so you know they make shift tables cause we are just starting out.

We've only been in business eight months.

Heidi, how long have we been funneling?

Everyday 24-7 for the past three months.

And we already have a booth.

Yeah we do.

I have to say you girls really take the fun out of funnel.

Actually we put the fun in the funnel.

See? You can't start "funnel" without "fun".

Or FU.

Three months and they've already had a booth. We're behind.

Max's homemade cupcakes.

Take this!

See? Success!

Scaring people into participating isn't success.

It's Scientology.

Calling Sophie we're taking that job.

You'd better have a good reason you're late,

because I managed to get here on time despite removing the disease pigeon feathers from my hair.

I do.

So today when we were cleaning up that apartment and I had my hands in a total stranger's toilet,

I realized if we're really gonna be successful, we've got to think outside the bull.

So after I thoroughly washed my hands,

I know they never really come off though, right?

Off your soul, I mean.

I made a call to a connection I know and got us a real cupcake job.

And it's in Manhattan. It's the first birthday party for the son of a socialite.

60 cupcakes with buttercream frosting. Up top.

Buttercream?

This is not the response I was expecting from my business partner.

I was expecting wooo! Awesome job! Thumbs up, buddy.

Why? Is your business partner on a show on Nicklodeon?

Look I don't do buttercream.

Buttercream is a bitch.

If it doesn't stay refrigerated, it falls apart as fast as a two-celebrity marriage.

Max we have to take this job, it's the next step for us,

cause all we're doing these days is cleaning apartment and working at the diner.

That's not all I'm doing. I also babysit for Peach.

Oh, Peach is fine with it.

Why would Peach be fine with it?

Look I was gonna tell you this after the Nickelodeon high five

but that didn't happen and I got thrown.

Peach is the connection I used to get us the party.

You called Peach without asking me and begged her for a job?

I didn't beg. I ask her if she knew anybody who could use us

and she was more than happy to recommend us for her friend Constance.

No way I'm not comfortable with this.

Sometimes you have to do things that make you uncomfortable.

It's the way you grow.

No it's the way you get a ride home from a keger in the woods.

Max.

Max I'm sorry but we can't turn into those people who work and work

just to pay their bill don't have any time to pursue their dreams.

You mean Americans?

I'm telling Peach tomorrow we're not doing it. Now go get some milk.

No problem cause that's what waitresses do and

apparently that's all we'll ever be.

What?

I have to prove the sex was not that good.

Oleg on the food?

Don't say it like that,

That ham was already glaced before we go there.

So I am guessing you are back together?

Oh no no, the sex was not that good.

Oh, it was that good.

I went to get Mayo,

and it all happened so fast.

Ok babies, give me fashion, give me a face, yea.

Peach, I don't know what's going on in your apartment,

but I would like it on the record:

I'm not a willing accomplice.

So what is going on here?

Well, Brad is giving us seduction like his name sake

and Angelina is giving us nothing like her name sake.

This is pretty fancy set up, were the kids nominated for an Oscar?

Best performance by twins in a ridiculous situation?

It's a photo spread for my new mummy blog,

I'm calling it Mummy and Me. Isn't that clever?

And original.

I had a blog since my friend Constance started her blog,

we both have blogs and we both have babies.

Only her babies are adopted from Africa.

She will be winning if I didn't have two from a poor white hell billy thuggery.

About your friend Constance, I think I was supposed to do a party for her.

Max, please don't screw this up because I hate her and I need her to love me.

Yea, here is the thing. Thank you,

but Caroline should never have called you and asked you for a favor.

I'm not comfortable asking to do that.

But I did it for you.

And now you will do that for me.

And Max this has to go swimmingly

which is a new word I just learned.

So you are saying I can't get out of it?

I'm saying: Max, you can't get out of it.

Max, still not talking to me because of the Peach thing?

Fine.

Those are some pretty bad ass buttercream cupcakes,

ain't no drama going on in that box!

Ok, I just went gangster, and not even a smile?

What? Are you planning to never talk to me again?

You nodded, if you were deaf that would be talking.

That's true, my brother is deaf,

not from birth, from firecrackers.

Relax, we still have time.

Ten more minutes on the train and a 15-minute walk.

The buttercreams are not gonna melt.

- Some people just like to create non-verbal drama. - En huh.

Attention passengers.

- There is an obstruction up on the track ahead. - No.

I bet someone jumped in front of the train.

Oh my God, what a tragedy,

the buttercream!

Attention passengers.

We apologize for this delay.

There is still an obstruction on the tracks ahead.

It's totally like a body.

They can't get it off and what not.

We should be moving shortly.

What is with this guy? He said that 20 minutes ago.

How are your cupcakes? Mine are getting a little loose.

Still? Still not talking?

Fine, Max. Now I'm not talking neither.

What is with her? She said that 20 minutes ago, too.

And she just keeps talking.

I know, right?

We probably hit the body.

So it is all up in the wheeling and what not.

Well, if there is what not under our wheels, and I don't get these cupcakes there,

I'm going to lose my babysitting job.

- Are we babysitters or bakers? - I was talking to him.

Stay out of this.

Nina,

if you two are bakers, maybe you should break up some of those cupcakes,

so we all don't starve.

No one is touching these cupcakes.

Our entire future is riding on these mothers.

I think I'm smelling like a, like a dead body smell.

Miss, you are making things so much worse in here.

Are you telling me you don't smell that?

It's like when my sister burned herself throwing firecrackers at my brother's ear.

This train is out of service.

We are approximately two blocks away from the next station.

We're gonna have to take you on foot.

Please form a single line and we will escort you to safety.

We are gonna walk?

They expect me to walk through a subway tunnel in heels?

Hey everybody I think we know who we are gonna eat first.

My god, it's so hot up in here. It's like 200 degrees.

If I faint and fall down,

the others rats will like eat me and what not.

Rats? Max, are there rats?

It's a subway. The floor is made of rats,

but you really have to worry about, the ninja turtles.

Thank you for responding.

Hold up.

I'm telling you right now. If I lose my babysitting job over this,

the rats would be the better option for you.

We are only two blocks from the station. We can still make it.

How are your cupcakes?

They are still holding together.

Like us. We are still holding together.

Geez, come on, don't bring gal. Less talk more walk.

Folks, It's a bit of gap here.

A gap? There can't be a gap. Why is there a gap?

Because people need reasonably price basics.

I'm gonna hop across and help the rest of you over.

Hey miss, you are next.

I put the line on, just grab it.

You know how many times I heard that from a guy in the tunnel?

Hey, just take these.

Careful, sir, it's buttercream!

I'm throwing you my purse. Here it comes.

Thank you. Right. Thank you.

Ok, miss, you next.

Hand me over the cupcakes and jump.

I can't. I'm terrified.

What if I fall? The rats will eat me.

I can never come back from that.

Bankruptcy? Yes. Rats? No.

"Hey Caroline, where are your toes?"

"Well, it's a long story."

Girl, if you fall that third rail,

it will fry you way before the rats get there.

Listen, Mariah, you are freaking me out.

If we're lucky, the rats will eat your mouth.

Caroline, it's ok. It's just a step. Take the step.

Hold these.

Come on, I'm right here.

I took the step, now you have to take the step.

That's right. You did. I do.

Here we go.

Back up everybody. Yea!

Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

Go Caroline, go Caroline, ahhhhhhh!

I saw a rat. We made eye contact.

You know what? It would probably be easier if took those heels off.

Sir, that is never going to happen.

We are in Manhattan.

I may be under it but I'm still in it.

And when they pull out my half-eaten body,

I will be wearing my heels.

Mariah?

Why? I only have one.

What are you gonna do?

Jump back over and do something and whatnot?

Constance, we're sorry, we are late.

I don't wait. I don't wait for anything.

I already have the iPhone 8.

Sorry, we couldn't help it. We were trapped on the subway.

Well, just put some cupcakes on a plate

cause I got a roomful of women out there who need to cut something in half

and then eat the other half, and they need to do it now!

Welcome back to Manhattan. How do they look?

Like they all had unprotected sex with each other?

Oh, how are you two? I'm looking for the babies, I'm about just ten seconds I'm just giving up.

- Peach, there is a problem with the cupcakes.  - There can't be.

Constance will kill me, literally. Her last two best friends went missing.

That is not attractive at all.

Is... is that what food looks like?

Why are there no cupcakes out? If you two work for me, I deport you.

There is a bit of cupcake situation. The buttercream sort of broke down on the way up.

It's not a problem, we can fix it.

I'll just run to a delly get what we need to touch them up and no one's the wiser.

And I take the full responsibility. My partner warned me that buttercream was a bitch.

I'm not being rude, that's technical baking term.

You expect me to pay 300 dollars for these?

Caroline Channing, I have to say that you're a bigger con artist than your father.

Then I have to say you're a bigger bitch than the buttercream.

I'm not your boss, so I can't hit you.

But I'm sure that Peach won't be your boss much longer either.

Right, Peach?

But I love Max.

She's been with me since I bought the twins.

I can't live without her.

You are never coming to another one of my parties.

Max, you're fired.

It's my fault. You lost your babysitting job, and I feel awful.

Hey, I'm the one who call that bitch a "bitch".

And I'm gonna write those awesome films right up until we got evicted.

Why can't you just admit that the sex was that good?

You know it, I know it, the ham with the bite marks in the freezer knows it.

Ok, fine. The sex was that good,

as was the ham.

It was that good because it was more than just sex.

It was love.

Oh... it is not love.

Oh, it is love.

Oh... it is not love.

It was dirty, disgusting sex.

Yes, it was.

Oleg, do you really love Sophie?

Yes, I do. And one day I will kiss her.

Her lips will be mine.

Wait, you never kissed her?

Not on the lips of her face.

But that day will come.

Man, I can't believe that I'm actually saying this,

but that is pretty freaking romantic.

I'm looking for Max, I think her last name is "Black".

Oh, sorry, maybe it's "African American"?

You think her name is "Max African American"?

Peach, what're you doing here? Who's with the twins?

They're in the car, don't worry,

I rolled up the windows and locked the doors, so they're safe.

Max, I'm sorry for pretending to fire you in front of the Constance.

Pretended? That felt pretty real.

Yeah, I'm good. My fake orgasms are so real even I believe them.

Peach, this is all my fault. Please give Max her job back.

That's why I'm here. Max, come back, I need you to watch them tomorrow,

and then everyday.

Peach, I don't think I can work for you tomorrow,

or any other day.

We have to focus on our business.

Max, are you sure you're comfortable with this?

No, I'm not comfortable, but that's the point, right?

You gotta take a step.

Well, then how about just for another year?

By then the twins will be old enough to take care of themselves.

No, but I promise I'll come by and say "Hi" to the twins whenever I can.

Oh, Max,

I will never find someone as wonderful as you who speaks English.

Bye, Max.

Wow, good for you, good for us.

Hope so. That's the first job I ever quit without a job to take its place.

You have another job. You work for yourself.

You're your own boss.

My own boss? I can't wait to sleep with myself to get a promotion.

Max, can you watch my tables
while I run to the restroom?

I already am.

I've been watching model girl

pretend she's eating for 30 minutes.

Oh, she's nice.

She always tips
on what she would've eaten.

Guess what, everyone?

I have a secret.

You're a woman trapped in a man's body?

No.

You're a man trapped in a woman's body?

You're a little boy

trapped in a little girl's body?

I am a man in a man's body.

We're not talking about your night life.

I have discovered something when going over

the employee applications.

Okay, perhaps I never worked
at the Waldorf Astoria,

but I did work with this guy,
Waldorf, in Astoria.

It's not you. Tomorrow is Caroline's birthday.

Why wouldn't I know that?

She tells me everything about her life.

I know so much about her cycle,

I'm feeling pressure to impregnate her.

I can do that for you.

It's weird.

Why wouldn't she want
to celebrate her birthday?

She celebrates everything.

Heads up, everybody.

I just refilled the paper towels.

Who's a team player? What, what?

Max.

You know what we have to do.

Aw, man. I knew this day would come.

All right, what's the least
amount I can do to keep my job?

Just tell me when it's over.

You have to throw her a party.

I'd rather you just

have your tiny way with me.

I don't like birthdays.
I don't even know when mine is.

My mom narrowed it down
to a two-week window in June.

But you are Caroline's BFF.

And it is BFF's job
to throw friend a party.

Han, I don't have enough money

to throw a party.

I don't even have enough money
to throw a baseball.

You have money. You be her BFF.

I already have a BFF-- Jamarcus.

And my last birthday,

he threw me a sick surprise party.

You must think BFF stands
for "barely freaking friends",

because there's no way you're down

with someone named Jamarcus.

Oh, really?

Then why did we exchange
ATM pin numbers?

Oh...

I'll just crop that, and we'll be good to go.

Max, Edwin's ready to show us
the design for our new website.

Come see it.

Dude, you and the webmaster
have been talking "business"

every day for a week.

Is something going on there?

Shouldn't the web be mastered by now?

It's strictly business.

All right, but it's costing us $200.

Might as well get something out of it.

Maybe let him browse your Yahoo?

Looks like he might have
a big ol' hard drive

with a lot of ram.

Yeah, he's cute, but I don't
want a relationship right now.

And I don't do one-night stands.

All right, so don't stand. Lay down.

That's not me--

the next morning,
doing the walk of shame.

I always see those girls
with their messed-up sex hair,

carrying their heels,
clutching their coats

to hide last night's outfit.

Going into Kinko's to use Google maps

so you can figure out where you are.

You really put the "ho" in "Kinko."

Oh. Sorry, Sophie.

We're closed.

Oh, no. I'll be quick.

I just want a cupcake to go.

I'm on my way to 24 hour fitness.

Ja, and I put it on the cupcake
holder on the treadmill.

Uh, Max,
my town car is parked out front

and I was wondering
if you wanted me to wait

for you and Caroline to give you
a ride back to our building.

Oh, no. It's okay.

We still have to clean up
and take the garbage out.

Oh.

Oh, looks like the garbage
is taking itself out.

The game continues.

Here is my number.

I invite you to call me

when you realize what a catch I am.

Or any time you are drunk and willing.

Max, I'm going to need the doggy bag as well.

Not for the cupcake.

To puke in.

So I'll get this finalized,

and then I'll stop
by the diner tomorrow

so you can sign off on
the layout before we go live.

This is so exciting.

Oh, wait, Edwin. Shoot.

I forgot to show you
the new pricing chart.

It's cool, I can draft it up right now

and upload it when I get home.

Yeah, webmaster. You work pretty fast.

But I bet you can work slow, too.

And really fast again.

I can be done in a minute.

Ooh, not what you want to hear.

Max.

It's fine. We can wait.

You know what? You stay here.

I have to go to the store
and pick up stuff for your--

my what?

Your cupcake business that
you're making me do with you.

Get home safe.

Um, hey, where do you live, Edwin?

Hell's kitchen.

Oh, cool.

You're going to want
to take the "c" down,

transfer to the "l,"
and if you get lost,

there's a Kinko's on 6th and 14th.

That's embarrassing. Max was just trying to--

yeah, I work on complicated web programs.

I think I cracked that code.

She wants us to hook up.

Yeah. I'm sorry.

Why are you sorry?

That's all I've been thinking about.

Yum, yum.

Oh, my God.

They are so hot.

Don't give me that look.

Oleg.

Caroline.

What are you doing here?

What are you doing here?

I live here, and I'm just coming out

from going to get coffee.

It was delicious.
I drank every bit of it.

Outside. That's why I don't have a cup.

But you're wearing
the same outfit from last night.

You're wearing the same outfit
from last night.

And you have messed-up sex hair.

You have messed-up sex hair.

Webmaster?

Sophie?

She called me up and we made hand love.

But I thought Sophie hated you.

Well, she doesn't hate my hand.

But you cannot tell anyone.

That was her one condition.

That and a copy
of my recent blood tests

signed by a medical professional.

Deal.

And you can't tell
anyone about me, either.

Especially Max.

I'd never hear the end of it.

Deal.

Pinky swear?

Actually, never mind.

I don't know where
your fingers have been.

I just told you where they've been.

Max

I'm so excited for this party.

I wore my loose clothing
so I can dance all night.

God, I cannot take this party pressure.

I'm just going to go in the back

and run a can opener across my wrist.

Oh, Max. I'm sure you did a great job.

You know, as long as you have a DJ,

some champagne, and a psychic.

No, no, and no.

I got some balloons, a hummus tray,

and possibly Earl.

He still hasn't confirmed.

Oh.

You don't need psychic to know

that this is going to be
a horrible, horrible party.

Well, thank God
Caroline has new boy toy.

She might not mind as much.

What are you talking about?

Yeah, I saw them kissing in
front of the diner last night.

Yeah, I sat there
and watched for an hour.

They were really going at it,
hot and heavy.

You know, like the Showtime
network in the good old days.

Oh, great.

Now I have to invite him
to the party, too?

I only got a six-pack of Capri Suns,

so people are going to have to share.

Congratulations, it's official.

Our website is now live.

Congratulations, it's official.

You're a whore.

I hear you got
your Kinko's card punched.

What?

Don't "what" me.

I know you hooked up
with the webmaster.

Pick up.

Oleg, you told Max?

What's happening?

Our deal's off.

Oleg had sex with Sophie last night.

No...

It wasn't sex. Just hand stuff.

Yeah, and nothing above the waist.

I'm a lady.

I got all hot and bothered
watching Caroline and big Han.

Okay...

You know, I really think
this is between Caroline and me.

You mean between Caroline,
you, and your strippers.

Strippers?

I have seen this man in a strip club.

Han, you were in a strip club?

Earl took me.

Damn it, Han.

You're going to sell me out

after I spotted you $100 in ones.

You went to Spreaders without me?

Why would you take Han to a strip club?

Yeah, is his lap even big enough for a dance?

Earl, I'm so disappointed in you.

That's it. I'm not going to your party.

What party?

Damn it, Earl!

It's supposed to be
a surprise for her birthday.

Who told you it was my birthday?

Han.

Damn it, Han!

I didn't want a party

and I don't want to celebrate
my birthday this year.

Well, too bad,

because your BFF is throwing you
a big blow-out.

Oh, Max. Now I feel bad.

You feel bad now, wait till you see the party.

Caroline's birthday. Woot, woot.

Thanks, but you don't have
to say that after everything.

Max...

I know you had limited budget,

but music is free.

Yeah, well, I'm a douche.

Speech!

Speech!

I can't carry this party much longer.

Okay, I'd like to say something.

Wait, wait.

Can't we wait till we cut the cake?

Cake?

People are still doing that?

Yes. Our livelihood depends on it.

There's only one party as bad as this one.

That's the Donner Party.

And even they had better food.

I'd like to say happy birthday
to a very pretty lady

who I just had the pleasure of meeting,

and I think I'm going
to be seeing a lot more of her.

Aw.

I'll go get us some more drinks.

Okay.

Get rid of him.

What?

It was a one-time thing.

I thought you weren't that kind of girl.

I realized it had almost been a year

since I had sex, and I decided

I rather not be that kind of girl.

But I don't want a relationship.

Hey, I get it. Hit it and quit it.

♪ hit it, don't babysit it ♪

Max, please.

Fine.

How am I going to make him go away?

It's not going to take a lot

to convince someone
to leave this party.

I'd like to ask everyone
to raise their cocktail,

but I can't.

So raise your Capri to the sun...

For a very special lady who I'm
sure I will be seeing more of.

Get rid of him. It was a one-time thing.

So was that the worst party
you've ever been to?

That was the worst party
anyone's ever been to.

So with the webmaster, how was the sex?

Pretty good.

But then he did that thing

where he pretended
he was going to choke me.

When did guys start doing that?

I don't know,

but if I knew that was his thing,

I would've asked him
to choke me at the party.

How did you get rid of him?

What did you say?
Did you let him down gently?

No, I told him to hit the pike.

It's a one-night stand. Guys get that.

So that's it? He wasn't upset?

Guys don't care.

One-night stands-- they come, they go.

Literally.

But what if he wants to see me again?

Relax.

It is not going
to come back to haunt you.

Unless you start feeling an itch...

Or a kick.

Well, thanks for dumping him.

And for the...

I'm going to go ahead
and call it a party.

I knew you wouldn't want me

to use any of the cupcake money,

and I was broke.

So I guess I am your BFF--

your broke friend forever.

Max, it really doesn't matter
what you would've done.

The only thing
I really wanted for my birthday

was to see my father.

And he's in prison,
so that didn't happen.

I may not be a good BFF,

I may not throw a great party,

but I do know where
to find a free bus to prison.

Hey, everybody.
We got a birthday girl onboard.

Sit yo ass back down!

See? Now we got a party.

This is nice getting out of the city.

Kind of reminds me
of the ride to the Hamptons.

Yo.

This your first time on the bangbus?

We call it the bangbus because
everybody here gonna get banged.

And in addition 'cause we're on a bus.

Hmm, makes sense.

Hey, I'm Shonda.

I'm Max. This is Caroline.

So you're all going for,
like, conjugal visits?

Pretty fancy term for getting

shawshanked on a three-legged cot.

Shawshanked. I like her.

I like your hair.

Did you just get back from Cancun?

No, no.

I saved up,
and I got these done for my man.

He says they make me

look like Alicia Keys meets Ed Norton

in American History X.

How sweet.

Ah, yo. What's your man in for?

My man's in for possession
of a sweet, sweet ass.

He makes that joke every time.

He's not my man, actually. He's my dad.

Oh, so you're a freak.

That's all right. I don't judge.

You see a name tag
on me that says "Judy"?

Oh, look. We just passed a Carvel.

What's a Carvel?

Carvel ice cream.

You know,
Fudgie the Whale, Cookie Puss.

Come on, how could you not know Carvel?

They have them everywhere.

Oh, wait.

Is that that white trash ice cream?

How dare you!

It is not white trash.

And I wouldn't be so high and mighty.

You're on a free bangbus to a prison.

I'm sorry.

I didn't realize you had such

a strong emotional connection
to ice cream.

Not to the ice cream. The ice cream cake.

When I was ten, I asked my mom
for a birthday party.

She said yes but then flaked out

and forgot to call anyone.

I'm starting to understand why

you don't like birthday parties.

So after I waited on the porch for an hour,

I'll stole 20 bucks from her purse,

thumbed it out to Carvel,

and bought myself
a Fudgie the Whale cake.

Ate the whole thing
with a pink plastic spoon,

and it was way better than
any party ever could have been.

I heard that.

There ain't nothing better
than Fudgie the Whale.

I love the chocolate crunchies.

Bitch, everybody love
the damn chocolate crunchies!

Hey, Shonda. Who are you here to see?

Who's available?

I'm just cracking wise.
You know I'm here to see Squirm.

Search her.

Damn. Is it my turn again?

Next.

We're not on that list. We didn't call ahead.

Leave it to me.

I've gotten into every club
I've ever wanted to get into.

Hi. Caroline Channing plus one.

I don't see you on the list.

Really? That's weird.

We should be on the list.
We're always on the list.

Max, we're not on the list.

We're not? I'm going to kill my assistant.

Oh, I know.

It might be under Deangelo Jefferson.

Come on, girls. Don't waste my time.

I'd like to see a manager.

There's no manager.

It's a prison.

Well, then who runs this place?

Well, the Aryan brotherhood
is getting pretty strong.

This is such amateur hour.

Give me 50 bucks for the door guy.

Are you seriously trying to bribe

an officer of the law
while inside a prison?

That's a federal offense.

Is it?

Probably.

Look, I should have you thrown
out for even suggesting it.

We do not accept bribes.

Okay, fine.

I'll let you take
your sweet time searching me

on the way in.

These two are clear to go through.

Max, you can't do that for me.

It's really for me. It's been a while.

Woot, woot.

I'm so excited to see my father

after all this time.

How do I look?

You look good. How do I look?

Do I still have
that freshly felt-up glow?

Well, that ginger over there
thinks you look good.

He's full-on staring at you.

Well, I should hope so.

If you can't get a dude
in prison to check you out,

it's time for a makeover.

No, he's looking
and nodding like he knows you.

Never seen him before in my life.

Max?

Max Black?

It's me, Irish.

I don't know, dude.
I think you got the wrong girl.

Max, I could never forget that face.

Trust me, you've never seen me before.

Oh, damn!

Oh, my God!

That's you.

So you do remember.

Of course.

Get rid of him.
It was a one-night stand.

See, they do come back to haunt you.

Shirt on.

Max, can you believe it?

Of all the prisons in all the world,

you walked into mine.

It's kismet.

I got rid of yours. You get rid of mine.

Listen, Irish. It was a one-time thing.

You're a guy. You get that.

How could you say it's a one-time thing?

I love you.

I blew up that chipotle for you.

Listen, I appreciate the ink,

but I don't really believe in love,

and truth be told,

I'm not even a fan of Mexican food.

Caroline Channing. This table.

Max, we have to go. My dad's coming.

Okay. Nice to see you, Irish.

Your body looks sick.

Max, hold on.

I'm not going to tell you again to back up.

Max, I'm not going to lose you twice.

I said, back up!

Don't tell me to back up.

That's the love of my life.

Come on, dude. Hit the pike.

Calm down.

Don't tell me to calm down!

Visiting hours are over! Everybody out!

No, no, no, wait! I can't leave.

Damn!

Oh, wait. There's my father.

I can see him, he's just coming in.

Oh, daddy. Daddy...
Hi!

Well, thank you very much, ladies.

My man was barely in
when I got pulled out.

I would like to apologize to everyone

for taking the bang out of the bus,

but in my own defense,

everyone here knows a little
something about crazy guys.

Sit yo ass back down!

Max, sit down before you start another riot.

I'm sorry. I blew it.

I screwed up your chance
to see your father.

I screwed up your party.

I even screwed up the
easiest birthday thing to do,

like get a cake.

I'm a terrible BFF.

It's okay.

Really, it's fine.

With the year I'm having,

it's not like you could've
made everything better

just by getting me a cake.

Well, no. Not just any cake.

Just as good as I remember it.

Best 40 bucks we ever spent.

And this birthday turned out
to be all right.

I did get what I wanted.

I got see my father.

It was only for a second,
but I saw him.

And he saw me. So thank you.

Yeah, and I got to see Irish.

Think he might be
the one that got away.

Well, the one that got put away.

You know, you and I are better than BFFs.

We're BBFs.

Bangbus friends.

So, to be clear,

you want delivery from this diner?

Yes, I do know what delivery means.

Do you know what E. coli means?

Where do you live?

If he eats from here,

in his bathroom in about an hour.

Will you be needing napkins? Utensils?

The number for Poison Control?

Well, good luck.

The delivery boy is on his way.

Oh, this is good.

I need the exercise.

I feel like I'm getting a little chubby!

Oh, I know.

I can see it through those shorts.

I was a delivery boy in Vietnam.

I mostly delivered bad news, like,

"That hooker was a dude."

Here's that tuna salad... and hurry.

Like that astronaut who
drove across the country

in a diaper, it's not gonna travel well.

See you later, haters.

And remember,

Earl's in charge when I'm gone.

Earl's in charge?

Okay. I have a business degree.

He had all three types of diabetes.

But I get it.

I'll be gone for... 20.

Speaking of 4:20,

Max, you wanna go smoke some weed?

The man in charge just sparked up a doobie.

But I get it.

And I'm about to get it.

Oh, no. Am I in charge forever?

Who the hell parked a
Rascal in a bike lane?

Uh... that's my bad.

It almost destroyed my helmet!

I know.

I can see it through those shorts.

And this is the sprinkle station.

Last stop on the cupcake train.

And this is the cash register,
where there'll be money someday.

And this is Max,

the other half of Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

Your little movie is about to be rated R

for strong, brutal violence.

Stop filming me.

I'm not filming.

I'm Periscoping.

Isn't periscoping when
you do mouth stuff on a guy

while he keeps a lookout for the cops?

Not all sex has to involve
the threat of an arrest, Max.

Periscope is a social media app

that streams live videos to your followers.

Tell everyone in Brooklyn
who loves food festivals

that we'll be at the
Taste of Bushwick tomorrow.

Or you can follow me into
the bathroom while I change,

and they can see some bushwick right now.

Max, this is great PR.

That's "public relations,"

not "Puerto Rican."

I know you were disappointed

when I took you to that PR seminar

and there were no cock fights.

I liked the Internet when
the only thing you could do

was look at cat pictures

and find out how old John Stamos is.

He turned 53 in August!

You know what's sad?

I'm too old to date him.

If Periscope is such great PR,

how many viewers did you just have?

One.

But maybe it was a really important one.

Really loving your
Periscope presence, Caroline!

Okay. It's a small build.

I still maintain that
Periscoping will be great

for our business.

For the record, I was filming my business

way before it was called "Periscoping."

Hi, everybody!

Oleg, I picked up your dry cleaning,

and good news!

They were able to get the raspberry stains

out of your banana hammock!

Oh, Lord.

Now who's gonna dry clean my mouth?

So you picked up my dry cleaning

instead of my cousin from the airport?

Your cousin's in town? That's weird.

I didn't get an alert on my phone.

Sophie, how could you forget?

This is why we started doing sudoku.

I thought you started doing sudoku

'cause she was hot and willing.

I got a lot on my mind.

I'm trying to design our future baby.

See, girls, I read this article

that says you can spin sperm
to get rid of the bad stuff.

So Oleg's not gonna be the father?

It's true.

There's a new technology

where you can select the baby's genes.

I miss selecting jeans.

Now I just reach into the $3 bin

and hope for the best.

Well, I'm gonna spin that jazz

till I get a girl baby with green eyes

and Jennifer Aniston's second nose

and... and my butt!

Why can't we get pregnant the natural way?

Up against a fence.

Hello.

I'm Gortak.

You look familiar.

Didn't you rib a dragon
on "Game of Thrones"?

Gortak!

There's my little cousin.

Hi!

I think my iPhone case
is made out of gortak.

Hi, I'm Oleg's wife, Sophie.

And you're one tall drink of yak's milk.

You know it, baby.

And he's taking that
tall right to the bank.

Gortak just signed to play pro basketball.

No way!

Basketball is my favorite sport,

next to bum wrestling!

I'm in town for a game against Brooklyn.

Brooklyn's my team.

They stink.

Yeah, well,

I relate to anybody who's
not doing that great.

Hey, I'm Max.

I used to shoot around in juvi.

We played arsonists
versus attempted murderers.

I did a lot of ribbon dancing.

Caroline's kind of the
Screech of the group.

And here comes Mr. Belding.

Max, it's almost your shift.

Why haven't you changed into your uniform?

It's almost spring.

Why haven't you changed into a butterfly?

Han, this is my cousin Gortak.

Gortak, this is...

Jackass boss.

Virgin.

"Little People, Big World."

I didn't catch all of that,

but I didn't love what I caught.

Oleg, do you and your Sophie

want to come to the game tomorrow night?

I have two tickets.

Oh, perfect timing.

As of yesterday, I'm allowed

to be within 50 feet of cheerleaders.

Yeah, no. You know what?

I'm sorry. I'm out.

You know, tonight I have to
genetically modify a person

while I watch "The Good Wife."

Take me, Oleg!

Which is the only time you
will ever hear me say that.

Good idea, Max.

Sophie would be pissed if I took a lady.

But, Max, what about our plans?

I don't want to taste Bushwick alone.

Then don't have more than three drinks...

And don't get in the
back of anybody's Isuzu.

You're pretty dressed up.

You know a food festival is just code

for eating outside next to garbage cans.

Maybe I should come.

Well, I say, "Dress for the job you want."

I would, but I don't know what the people

who test out all the new
potato chip flavors wear.

Cheeseburger Pringles?

Yes.

Hey, girls!

Look at my baby board!

Yeah.

I feel like we're finally getting close

to something I can work with.

You know, it really started to flow

once I threw away the
Anne Hathaway forehead.

That is the scariest thing I've ever seen.

Oh, well, good thing you didn't see it

with the Hathaway forehead.

I love baby number two, but I don't know.

Oleg still wants to be surprised.

Why don't you give us all a nice surprise

and brush his teeth while he's sleeping?

Right?

Yes.

Oh, right. Here.

Max, Oleg can't go to the game.

Our baby appointment
got changed to tomorrow,

and we got to get working on the baby body.

Oh, you know what?

That reminds me.

Max, do you have a picture of your boobs?

Oh, you know what?

I'll get it from Oleg.

I can't believe I have two tickets!

Ooh, I'm gonna call Earl.

It'd be fun to go with a friend.

Would it hurt you to
ask me to go to the game?

You know I'm not gonna say yes.

Do you want to go to the game?

Yes!

Wow, that surprised me too.

These are VIP tickets
from an actual player.

This could be better than Bushwick.

I mean, lots of celebrities
go to those games.

Ooh! Where are the fliers?

I bet we could get a lot of business there.

No!

We are not doing business!

Tonight is supposed to be fun.

Well, I find business fun, but okay.

One day, you will appreciate my ambition.

And one day, I will try lettuce,

but not tonight.

No fliers.

No fliers.

No fliers.

I just think this is a missed opportunity.

"Missed Opportunity"

was my stripper name at the Salty Dog.

Look, I don't want to work tonight.

Which also happened to be my catchphrase.

These can't be VIP seats.

I haven't been this winded since I climbed

the social ladder at theater camp.

These seats are great!

I usually sit in the parking lot

around a trash fire, singing doo-wop.

It's just, I've never sat
in the last row before.

My father made sure I
was always in the front.

Broadway, fashion week,

his criminal trial.

My father got me front-row seats

to the "Inability to Love" awards.

I'll try and let this
go, but I'm just saying,

we could have gone to
the Taste of Bushwick,

and we'd still be closer to the court.

Oh, I love the taste of Bushwick.

I don't care for it much.

Hi, I'm June, and this is Dianne.

We're sort of the "mayors" of section Y.

Been to every game.

I'm Max. This is Caroline.

You guys want a finger?

Oh, we're just friends.

Do you want a finger?

Sure.

We'll take one if you got an extra.

And how 'bout that hot dog?

You still working on that?

Max, you don't know where
that finger has been.

What do you mean?

It's been in a box in my car.

Yeah, Caroline.

This finger's been in
her box out in the car.

What part of that don't you get?

Careful.

That beer cost more than I
spent on underwear last year.

I don't like it up here.

I don't even like beer.

It's so bloaty.

Come on. It's not that bad.

Oh, really?

Then why is that guy shaving?

Well, obviously, he's got a
very important job interview

as conductor of the crazy train.

Max, our seats are in a shanty town.

I think somebody tried to sell me a hubcap

on the way up the stairs.

Ooh! How much?

Can I borrow those binoculars,

so I can look at something that's not this?

Max! Oh, my God!

Look at all the VIPs down there.

Well, someone's "VI-peeing"
right over there.

Max, I want to be down there.

Oh, I know what you need.

Wanna finger?

Look!

A rich couple fighting courtside!

Oh, he's storming off!

She's storming off!

You should do play-by-play

on the "I Don't Care" network.

Come on! Let's go steal their seats.

What?

I like where I am.

My ears already popped.

We're settled here.

That's the difference between us, Max.

I don't settle...

until I'm, like, 42,

and then I might have to
marry someone shorter than me.

I, on the other hand, love settling.

My first words were, "Eh, it's fine."

Look, all we have to do

is make a few smart, strategic moves,

and a better opportunity awaits.

Please?

All right. Sorry, ladies.

She wants me to go down with her.

Just tell her you got a headache.

Okay, just act like we
belong in the VIP section.

I can't believe the limo driver

took that wrong turn,

and that's why we're late to the game,

and thus, our seats.

You forgot to mention

that we took thus bus here.

The point is, we made it.

I am back where I belong.

Can you just smell the money down here?

I think that's Gortak's ball sweat.

Hello, ladies

who magically appeared
in the second quarter.

Can I see your tickets?

Oh!

What?

These are my tickets to most places.

Our tickets? Of course.

Let me just find them in here.

Here they are!

Oh, sorry about the popcorn.

I'm used to it.

You rich people are pigs.

Max, I haven't been called
a rich pig in five years!

This is pretty cool!

I told that Chinese lady up top

with the backpack full of loose carrots

I'd be back, but I don't think so.

Oh, my God.

I should totally Periscope this

so people think we're big shots.

We are so close,

I could get my nose broken by a ball!

And I could meet the doctor
who fixes your broken nose!

Everything is working out!

Oh, my God.

We are in the same row
as Jay-Z and Beyonc�!

And they brought Blue Ivy!

I can't believe I'm
seeing our royal family!

I can't believe I'm touching
the court with my feet!

Maybe I should just drag my
butt across it like a dog.

Is that too far?

Oh, my God!

Beyonc� just made eye contact with me!

She sees me every time
she looks to the left,

to the left.

I should get them one of our fliers.

Luckily, I always keep an emergency flier.

That and a key to my old house,

in case this all turns out to be a dream.

That's my dream too.

Ooh! Here comes the nanny.

Fran Drescher's here?

No, Blue Ivy's nanny.

I'll get her our flier.

Excuse me, miss, in the
drop-crotch sweatpants!

Go, go, go! Ten seconds!

Wait! Miss, wait!

Can you take this?

- Max, she took the...
- Go, go, go!

- Oh!
- Ooh!

Max, what did you do?

I took you to a basketball
game like an idiot!

And now I'm about to run.

What is our end game here, Max?

Are we hiding? Are we fleeing?

I just want to know what
we're ugly-walking toward.

Do I look like a person with an end game?

Also, ya ended the game.

Angry mob aside, the good news is

I did manage to get that
flier to Blue Ivy's people.

The bad news is you created
the biggest disaster in sports

since Magic Johnson's talk show.

Someone's coming.

Well, you said you wanted more followers.

Now you have them in real life!

Oh, my God.

This is where the 17th best
team in the league gets naked!

And also where it ends
for ol' Max and Caroline.

What? It's not like the players

come right into the
locker room after the game.

Oh, my God.

The players come right into
the locker room after the game!

Of course we'd be in here.

This is so us.

You know what else is so us?

Me stealing one of these jerseys.

Let's do the interview in the locker rooms.

Crap! They're coming in here.

We can't be the face of this, Max.

We'll be the most hated
business in Brooklyn.

And I'm including the
new breakfast restaurant

with the valet stroller parking.

This is where the 17th
best team in the league

goes number one!

And from the looks of it,

their aim isn't good in here, either.

Those girls were crazy, man.

They cost us the game.

We were almost the 16th
best team in the league.

How did they get into the VIP section?

I was wondering the same
thing about Tim Allen.

Yo, man, take a look at
this thing on my back.

Does it look like cancer?

It just seemed like more
than a mole, you know?

Actually, it looks like
a precancerous basal cell.

We should get a better look
in the light in the bathroom.

Here! Over here.

Get in the ice bathtub.

It's big enough for two.

"Big enough for two."

That's what Chili's said about their new

coconut mozzarella sticks,
but... swing and a miss.

You went to Chili's and didn't tell me?

I was afraid you'd try
to get us a better table.

Oh, yeah.

I'd definitely get that thing checked out.

Yo, I got to ice this knee.

Of course they'd pour the ice on us!

And of course this would happen here,

'cause it's the 17th worst
thing that's ever happened to me!

Oh, you two sick?

Stay away from me. I can't get sick.

When you're 78, it takes about 2 days

to go from sniffles to
being eaten by your cat.

We'll be fine...

if half a Tylenol can
cure full-body hypothermia.

Max, I feel like you're still mad at me

for wanting more for us than bad seats

and a struggling business.

Of course I'm mad!

I haven't been this cold

since that winter I was
on "Deadliest Catch."

Well...

I've got a waste can of
baby faces I'm not gonna use.

Yeah.

Turns out, we're not gonna
design our baby anymore.

But what about wanting it
to have a delicate chin?

And a thigh gap?

You know, girls, I realized

I just want to have a healthy, happy baby.

You know, it's like my Aunt Ruffa said

after she lost her tongue, you know...

"Dou det what dou det,
and dou don't det updet."

You know, which roughly translates to,

"You get what you get,
and you don't get upset."

That's a really mature decision.

The doctor wanted 60 grand.

Yeah, that affected our decision too.

Well, maybe letting things happen naturally

is the way to go.

Because sometimes when you force things,

you put $130 million
worth of basketball players

on the disabled list.


Evening, hot chocolate.

Max, we got big trouble from Little China.

Hi, Max.

Big trouble?

There's nothing big about him. He looks
like they won him in a bear claw machine.

Max, what is the worst sentence you
ever want to come out of Han's mouth?

I got you pregnant?

Come on, bad, bad.

I got you pregnant again?

I'm putting in karaoke.

No! No!

Han...

Those guys better be up there because we're
officially putting ass crack on the menu.

I am adding a TV to bring
in more customers.

We can have theme nights,
Ultimate Fighter nights,

Real Desperate Housewives of Bravo City nights,

and best of all, karaoke night.

You can't give hispters a microphone.

That's like throwing gasoline
on a pretentious fire.

Hipsters like karaoke.

Replace the word "like"

with the word "Hitler"

and you got the three
worst things in history.

Max, I hear what you say, but

everybody else say "he-ey!"

All my single ladies!

Okay. Next person
is going to sing

Teenage Dream by Katy Perry,

who is pretty now but used to
have very horrible acne.

This is the third
Teenage Dream in 45 minutes.

Why don't I just close my nuts
in the cashier's drawer?

Come on up now,
girl named "Stacey."

I got this.

Look, I don't know you,
but I like you.

And I respect both hair choices.

I hate karaoke.

I can't afford to have
any more hate in my head.

My hate is at capacity.

Sit this one out,
I'll comp your cobbler.

What did you do?

Calm your bells down, Oleg.

Not my stations.

Where's Caroline?

Would it make you jealous

if I said she was
back here with me?

Jealous?
No.

Pissed?
Probably, because we're busy

and it would take me
all that time

to get the duct tape
off her mouth and hands.

What are you doin' in here,
snow white?

If you're lookin'
for one of your dwarves,

he's out there,
holding the mic.

Look, my bite is off.

See, I did the bite test.

The number seven incisor is
crossing over number nine.

Hold up. You know
the names of your teeth?

Don't you?

I don't even know
the name of my father.

Ow, I just bit my tongue.

Ah! Number 12 just joined
the party.

I'd stop doing that right now.

You just made it
into Oleg's spank bank.

Congratulations.

What am I gonna do
without my bite guard?

My teeth don't know where to go.

Well, maybe the should just
backpack for a couple of years,

so they figure it out.

Listen, perfect teeth,

this is a nightmare for me.

The technical term for this is
"advanced bruxism."

And the technical term for you
is "overly dramatic."

Yesterday you freaked out 'cause
we were out of toilet paper.

Just hold it till you get
to work like everybody else.

Now, maybe I sing
while others wait.

Uh-oh.
We got real problems now.

I choose Susan Boyle
popular song

from all clips on Internet.

It's called I Dream--

Keep dreaming.

Oh, you're back.

We thought you ran away.

Chestnut and I were
just about to pick out

another human from the shelter.

I had quite a day.

8:00 to 10:00...
Grind, grind, pain.

10:00 to 11:00...
Pain, pain, grind.

So I went to the drug store

and bought an $8 bite guard,

which didn't fit
my freaky Tim Burton mouth.

And when I tried to return it,

the cashier, Rhonda,

whose nametag said
she was happy to help,

but who was neither happy
nor helpful,

said that I couldn't return it

because it had already
touched my "teef."

For someone whose jaw
is about to unhinge,

you're sure flapping it a lot.

Why is this rag
with my father on it here?

Don't look at me.
Chestnut bought it.

He likes it when I read him
his daily horse-oscope.

Why is everybody so obsessed
with the fact that

he hasn't said anything?

Haven't you ever been
at a loss for words?

Tampons, yes.
Words, nah.

Well, this will
make me feel better.

Whenever I'm in pain,
I need a treat.

You know, whenever you're
in pain, that is my treat.

Sushi!
I hope you like crab roll.

I never had sushi.

That doesn't even make sense.

No sushi, no dentist...
Who are you?

A poor person.

Sushi's lazy.

If I come to your restaurant,

get up off your ass
and cook the damn fish.

I wish we could afford to go
to this little sushi place

in Tribeca where
my father always took me.

We had this little joke.

Every time we'd walk in,
I'd always say...

And we would just laugh!

So you're not funny
in Japanese either.

I got this at a corner deli.

The cashier was Japanese.

She said it was good.

Oh,
I'm sure it's great.

'Cause
the disenfranchised immigrant

serving the spoiled white girl

would have no reason to lie.

Get ready
for something heavenly!

That's not heaven.

- Spit it out.
- Ugh!

Ugh!

What a disappointment.

Your first time.

Well, that's kinda the way
it goes with me and first times.

Here, clean yourself off.

That's exactly the way it goes!

It's not that bad.

It's not that bad.
It's not that bad.

No.

For a dentist office
in the subway,

it's pretty good.

Seriously, how are you
not running out of here?

I have no choice.

Now that I have no money
or health insurance,

I have to get used to
this third-world situation.

Third-world situation?

This is an underworld situation.

Okay,
there's bulletproof glass.

With a bullet in it.

All right, so the glass works.

It says to sign in.

Look, why don't you just

take some of our
cupcake business savings

and go to a good dentist office?

You know, one where you
won't get a staph infection

just from looking at the floor.

No, we can't do that.

That's our future.

Once we start doing that,

it's a slippery slope.

"Nicole Richie"?

I don't want anyone to know
I was here.

I know this situation
is less than ideal,

but I am having
a dental emergency.

No, he's having
a dental emergency.

Come on, let's go over here
and see if this man can help me.

Hi.

Welcome to Subway Smiles.

I told ya, we'll get to ya.

I'm sorry, girls.

I'm a little shaky.

I was just shot at.

I have a problem
with my teeth migrating.

I have advanced bruxism.

Ah.
I have hep C.

Everybody's got
their something.

What do you need?

We need to be leaving.

I just need a bite guard.

Oh!
I can do that.

That's where I squirt foam
into your mouth

and make a mold.

Come in the back.

If you go back there with him,

you'll need a bite guard
and a rape guard.

You want the gas?

Is that necessary?

You're gonna want the gas,
sweetheart.

Let's get outta here.

One more song before we close.

I sing Spice Girls'

Aww, tell me what you want,

what you really, really want.

That boy's more stiff

than Michele Bachmann's husband
at a Chippendales.

I will give you the money
for trip to fancy dentist.

Really?
Oleg, you would do that?

It's favor I do for you.

And at some point,
when I come to you for favor,

you will say yes,
like I say yes now.

Well, I'd need to know
what that favor might be.

I can't say for sure.

Will it be in a week
or a month?

I can't say for sure.

Will it be sexual?

Yes, it will be.

This I can say for sure.

Thank you, but no.

I am such an idiot.

I like it.
Keep going.

My bite guard is
just sitting in the bathroom

of my townhouse.

If I could only
get up on the roof,

then I could break in
through the skylight

like I used to when I snuck out
in high school.

Hello, I'm Max.
Have we met?

When I was 15, I paid
the security system guys extra

to not wire the skylight,

and then I snuck out and went
to Ilana Shapiro's Sweet 16...

- Cute.
- In Greece.

Hardcore.

I used to sneak
out of the house

and huff spray paint
with an ex-marine.

And sometimes,
I'd just sneak out,

look up at the stars,
and dream.

And then you said that.

See, I told you I can get this skylight open.

Turn on a light!

Wait till I close
the closet door.

Why are the floors so bouncy?

It's called "carpet."

What?

No way.
No way.

Is this Narnia?

I'm about to say something
I swore I'd never say.

O.M.G.

Again...O.M.G.

It's lame, but nothing else
really nails it.

This is the room that O.M.G.
was born for.

Max, it's just my closet.

Your clothes have a house!

Look, look!

You are rich!

Like, I know you've said
you were rich,

but you are rich.

You're embarrassing me.

Are you crazy?

This is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

What's this do?

Oh, my God.

You have a shoe rotisserie.

I designed it.

I call it my
"Ferris Heels."

I'd judge you
if that wasn't exactly what

I'd call it if I had one.

Okay, we should really go now.

Lemme just grab my bite guard.

What?

You have a museum
in your closet?

Come on, it's just a bathroom.

Just a bathroom?

It's the Louvre of pooping.

Here it is.

Ow. Ow. Ow.

Oh, yeah.

Do you two need
to be left alone?

We have to go.

Can't risk staying much longer.

Wow.
Just when I thought your voice

couldn't get any more grating.

It'll loosen up.

Oh.

Seriously, we should go.

Oh, um, I just have to do
one more thing before we go.

I think me and your tub
are going steady.

Oh, you found
the jacuzzi button.

I don't know who found who,

but we're together now.

I'm totally stealing some
of these ridonculous bath soaps.

This one's shaped like a vagina.

Seashell.

Sister, this is
a mint green vagina.

Did you go to the prom
with your dad?

That's my debutante dance,

when I came out.

Out?

Like you came out
that you were dating your dad?

Gross.

I think I can still fit
a goose feather pillow in.

Hey, what's this one of you
and Chestnut and your dad?

Oh, that's when my dad

bought Chestnut for me.

It was my first-period present.

Your dad got you a horse
for getting your period?

O.M.G.

Know how I celebrated
getting my period?

Stole a painkiller
and half a beer

from my mom's boyfriend.

Wasn't a horse,
but it was pretty awesome.

How come there are no pictures
of your mom?

'Cause there aren't any.

She cheated on my dad
when I was five,

and my grandmother
got rid of her.

Not in, like, a mob way.

In a society way,
which is worse.

So who raised you?

Well, Estella from 1989 to '96.

Then, Dominica from '97 until
she went back to Guatemala.

Then no one.

Funny.

You didn't have a father, and I
didn't have a mother. So we're--

Oh, we're alike?

Look around.
We have nothing in common.

Hey, what's this button for?

Music.

Oh, lemme guess.
Show tunes? Boy bands?

Both: I love this song!

♪ You are the girl ♪

♪ that I've been dreamin' of ♪

♪ ever since
I was a little girl ♪

♪ you are the girl ♪

♪ that I've been dreamin' of ♪

♪ ever since
I was a little girl ♪

♪ One!
I'm bitin' my tongue ♪

♪ Two!
He's kissin' on you ♪

♪ Three!
Oh, why can't you see? ♪

♪ do do do do do do do ♪

♪ do do do do do do do ♪

♪ do do do do do do do ♪

♪ Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! ♪

♪ Dance! Dance! Dance!
Dance! Dance! ♪

See?

I knew what we had
in common wouldn't last.

Were you crumping for a second?

Maybe. Were you
tootsie-rolling for a second?

Yes.

Okay, get dressed.

We really should go now.

I have all the essentials.

Tampons, toilet paper,
comforter, body shimmer.

Wait, what about the clothes?

Oh, what am I gonna do?

Walk around Williamsburg
in a $3000 gown?

Oh, my God.

Wait a minute.

Grab everything
with a price tag on it

that we can resell.

Or that you think
I'd look amazing in.

Not the furs!
They're wired!

Why would you wire the furs?

Everybody wires the furs,
bitch!

Security's gonna be here
in ten minutes.

Just grab everything you can.

Wait! How are we going to
carry it all back to Brooklyn?

Jealous?

Look, two seats.

I think you got more stuff
than me.

Well, you spent five minutes
saying good-bye to the tub.

This was my fa purse
to take dancing.

How'd you keep it
on your shoulder

when you went all mad crump?

Look.
$200!

It's not enough we're sitting
on the subway in furs...

You gotta make it rain?

This is so exciting.

It's going right
into our cupcake fund.

- Or--
- Or what?

Where was that place you
always went with your dad?

Toro with black truffle.

You are about to have
a sushi toro-gasm.

Will you calm down?
It's just--

Oh, sweet bejesus,
that's delicious!

If this is sushi,

what was that other stuff
we ate?

Wrong.
On every level.

We need more of this.

Like, all of it.

Can we have some more toro?

Thank you so much.

And, uh...

I get it now 'cause I'm rich.

I don't know how
you're pulling it off.

What do you mean?

Giving up everything
that you had.

The maids, the closet,
the dentist, the sushi, the tub.

All of it.
The tub.

I almost can't give it up,

but I only had it for an hour.

You're kind of a badass.

Max, you just called me
a badass.

I'm drunk on black truffle.

It's my dad!

Wait, he actually exists?

Like the townhouse and the tub?

The tub.

Hi, daddy.
How are you?

I miss you so much.

I'm good.
No, really.

I'm still staying in Brooklyn
with my friend, Max.

She's great.

Oh!

Oh, okay.
Hold on.

Love you, daddy.

He wants to talk to you.

Me? Why?

I wouldn't know what to say.

Take it!
He's only allowed five minutes.

Yo, what's up, Martin Channing?

Oh.

You're welcome, but I di--

Well, thank you.

Yeah, she's great.

Real trooper.

Well, bye.
What?

Okay, I'll tell her.

Daddy?

He's gone.

So that's what a father
sounds like.

What did he say?

He wanted me to remind you
to wear your bite guard.

See, he can't be
as bad as everyone says.

He just can't be.

Oh, my God.

The 200 didn't cover it.

Start checking the purses!

Oh, hey.
Do you take hats?

Any cougars in the house?

And in case you don't know,

"cougar" means older lady
with a large sexual appetite.

Lady past prime
with tight clothes

who wants sex from young men.

Max, what is the one thing
worse than karaoke?

Oh, no.

That's right.
Open mic night.

Cougar also have face lift.

From behind, look 22.

She turn around, 72.

It's true!

It's funny 'cause it's true.

Bad news.

They heightened security
because we tripped the alarm.

The entire townhouse
is locked down.

We can never go back!

My tub!

Why does anything that gives me
pleasure wind up behind bars?

Forget about the tub.

Everything was inventoried.

We can't sell the furs.

I should've thought of that!

Yeah, you should've.

'Cause you know they always
inventory the furs, bitch!

One steak sandwich

and a cheeseburger
with muenster cheese.

We're out of muenster.

Oh, since when?

Well, let's see,
the diner opened in '82.

So '82.

Hi, sorry but we're
out of muenster.

Seriously, dude?

I wanted muenster.

Sorry, we have cheddar,
Swiss or American.

I hate cheddar
and Swiss blows.

Well... then American?

American cheese?

What am I,
at grade school?

Yeah, go to
the principal's office.

I can't have another idiot
up my ass right now.

It's at capacity.

Max, I got this.

Would you like to see
the menu again?

This is crap, okay,
I wanted muenster.

Well, I wanted to be
running a fortune 500 company

instead of waiting on a toxic
man-child like yourself.

But, we can't always
get what we want.

So, order something else,
put it in your pie hole

and get on
with your damn life.

Welcome to waitress.

We've been expecting you.

Here you go, table ten, Earl.

Have any exciting plans
for tomorrow?

Just trying to not
die in my sleep, Max.

How about you?

I'm going to visit
Caroline's horse.

He was adopted by
a rich white lady

who could give him everything
we couldn't afford to.

Which is everything.

White people will
adopt anything.

I figured out the best way
to go see Chestnut.

We take the J train to the 4,

the 4 to Grand Central,

change trains to Riverdale

No, but there's a dicey
underpass at Grand Central

where we might get shot.

I am so excited
to see my baby again.

Me too.

In the Lifetime movie version,

we get there
and Chestnut likes

his new home better
and then we cry.

Excuse me, Hi.

Sorry to bother you.

I'm Rhya,
I'm a little embarrassed.

I just got my period.

Mazel tov.

Do either of you
have a tampon?

Not me.

I just go off into
the woods and don't come out

until it's over.

I have one.

I'm so sorry
to bother you guys.

No problem, "Sisterhood of
the Traveling Panty Shields"

Actually, no,
I don't have one.

Here's a quarter,
there's a tampon machine

- in the ladies' room.
- Thanks.

Pick up, table six.

I couldn't help overhear.

I have tampon.

Oleg, why do you
have a tampon?

Same reason I carry a lighter,
even though I don't smoke.

Feels good to be the hero.

Sorry, again, but do you
have any more change?

It's 75 cents.

It's a quarter.

75.
Says so on the machine.

It better not or I'm about
to rage against the machine.

What?

Han, I need to see you
in here now.

But that is the ladies' room.

You're fine.

Women bring their little boys

in here all the time.

Everybody decent?

Man in the ladies' room.

I apologize for
personal intrusion.

You don't have to
cover your eyes.

It's a ladies' room,
not a solar eclipse.

Max, why do you want
to see me

in this inappropriate
meeting place?

This is why.
The tampon machine.

Oh, this is not man topic.

I do not wish to discuss
time of the month

when ladies must chase
the cotton mouse.

Chase the cotton mouse?

Geeze, where'd you get
your sex education?

Lambchop's playalong?

Han, you changed
the price of tampons?

Yes, this is not
appropriate talk.

No, this is not
appropriate action.

They've been
a quarter forever.

Look how old
this machine is.

Harriet Tubman used
to get her tampons here.

I'm a businessman.

Emphasis on the man.

I do not belong in here.

Hey, hey!

Don't make me chase you,
you little khaki mouse.

Look, han, everyone knows
there are certain things

that people need
in an emergency

that you never raise
the price on.

Things like what?

Off the top of my head,

tampons and 40-ounce beers.

Max, why are you so upset?

It is only
two more quarters.

Han, that's
a 200% price hike.

That's outrageous.

You're taking
advantage of women.

If men were the ones
who got periods,

tampons would be
thrown free

from floats
like Mardi Gras beads.

I went to
Mardi Gras once--I was 11.

My mom and her new boyfriend
wanted to go,

and they needed
a designated driver.

Earl, I need a man's opinion.

Is it my right
to raise the price

of any product in my diner?

What product
are we talking about?

Tampons.

Oh, brother.

Uh, you gotta just
relax and butt out.

Trust me.

I been in this
situation a long time.

Remember Aunt Flo?

That was my aunt.

Han, just because
you can take advantage

of a business situation,
doesn't mean you should.

It is law of
supply and demand.

Fine, then I demand you roll
back the price on the supply.

Come on han,
don't be so 1% about it.

You think occupy Wall Street
was a big deal?

Wait till you see occupy tampon.

We only protest once a month,

but it's an intense
five to seven days.

Got it.
Found the milk.

And I found it even faster
than the butter.

You know they're
not hiding it from you.

It's a grocery store,
not a sorority scavenger hunt.

Grocery shopping
is so fun.

When I was little,
I always wondered

where this stuff came from.

What's that?

Birthday card for my mom.

Aww, let me see.

"Get better soon"?

I thought you said
it was a birthday card.

It is, that's the
only one that seemed

appropriate for
our relationship.

Do you really
want your mom to get

a get well card
on her birthday?

Okay... here's one with
a strawberry, that's fine.

It's really about
the 50 bucks inside anyway.

That makes me sad.

Sad?
I can fix that.

Have a treat,
it'll perk you right back up.

Max, you just stabbed
a bag of candy.

That's okay, they'll
just think a gang

came through and did it.

A candy gang?

What,
like the sour patch kids?

Just step away and pretend
you didn't do it.

That's what you do.

We just need
to grab ten boxes

of Duncan Hines cake mix
and we're done.

Why would
we need to do that?

Why do you think?
To make the cupcakes.

I thought the cupcakes
were homemade.

They are,
I make them in my home.

You've been using
a boxed cake mix?

Relax, I only use it
when I'm tired.

And I add a secret ingredient
of my own to the mix

that makes them irresistible.

So you have no shame
using the store-bought mix?

I've no shame about anything.
Shame is overrated like Ke$ha.

In fact, they should rename
shame "keshame"

I just bought a Ke$ha album,
I'm so keshamed.

Shouldn't there be
someone to do this for us?

Oh, he's probably in the aisle

cleaning up after
the candy gang.

There was no candy gang
in here tonight.

That was a sneaky customer,
now wasn't it?

Hey, look.

For Chestnut, I can't wait.

I got him the kind with tops
on them, like Bugs Bunny.

He'll be so excited when he
sees the two of us tomorrow.

I know.

I was talking about
me and the carrots.

All right now,
your total is $70.49.

Wow, that seems like a lot.

I don't make the prices,
now do I?

No, I was just commenting.

Well, it's not CNN,
now is it?

- Here, give her the coupons.
- The coupons?

Yeah, here.

Max, you use coupons?

I had no idea.

You're looking at me like
I'm on To Catch a Predator.

We don't need to use those,
I have my tip money right here.

What are you talking about,
I have coupons.

Here, take them.

I-I have--

I can't, I don't want to.

I've fallen so far,
I can't fall any further.

Don't make me.

There's no need to go
down a keshame spiral.

Hi, she has coupons.

Oh, now you tell me
you have coupons?

Should have told me before,
now shouldn't ya?

I didn't wanna tell you
at all, she made me.

Now didn't ya?

Look, it's not a big deal.

Lots of people use coupons.

Coupons are for--

Poor people, yes.

Like us.

People who stand
at the cash register

and say things like,

"Wow, $70?
That seems like a lot."

Your new total is $12.70

wait, it just went
from $70 to $12?

Just like that?

The same food for less money?

The exact same food?

How is that even possible?

You used coupons,
now didn't ya.

Max, coupons are genius.

I'm late, I know.

I just got a text
from Chestnut.

"Where are you?

I'm wearing my best suit."

He spelled suit with a four, but
that's pretty good for a horse.

I have a good reason.

15 chicken pot pies.

Regular price: $1.47.

Coupon price: Free!

'Cause I bought 15
and used

the double coupon
in-store sale combo.

Listen to me with
the lingo already.

Reminds me of my first day
interning on Wall Street.

Chicken pot pies?

You don't even like them.

What does it matter
if I like them or not?

They were free.

It's free money.

Who doesn't like free money?

I don't know
about free money,

but this is like
watching someone

free base for the first time.

Chestnut's fine.

It's not a big deal.

Ooh, oh, I just got
another text from Chestnut.

"I'm so lonely,
I just tried smoking."

We can go tomorrow.

In the Lifetime
movie version,

we just missed the day we
were appointed by the court,

and Chestnut's new parents
move him out of town.

And we cry.

I get it, it's just that
after last night,

I woke up fascinated by
the concept of coupons.

So I did some research.

I found this woman online

who calls herself
the Williamsburg Coupon Queen.

Only she calls them
"cue-pons."

Is that the correct way
to pronounce it?

Eh, I'm gonna go with her way

after all, she is the queen.

Canned pumpkin?

Ten cans, double coupon,
five cents each.

Great, 'cause I'm always lying
in bed at night

thinking I wish I could crack
open a can of pumpkin.

Oh, and I found a coupon
for you to send your mom an

edible arrangement
for her birthday.

A pretty pineapple daisy says so
much more than cash in a card.

And it's for 40% off
the regular price.

That's perfect because my mom
was 40% off a regular mom.

And Max, I do have something
else for you in this bag.

Something that'll
make you very happy.

Canned yams for when I get
tired of canned pumpkin?

Better, look.

Look out, Han Lee.

I'm about to get my tamp on.

Well well, if it isn't
everything that's wrong

with the current economy,
in a boys' v-neck sweater.

Oh, what do you
think you are doing?

Oh, just putting straws
in the container...

in case, uh...

Just in case a woman might
suddenly need a straw

and not have 75 cents.

Those are not straws.

They do not belong in public.

Didn't your mother
ever teach you

that is secret, no-no
private lady thing?

You can't even say the name.

Come on Wall Street,
if you can sell it,

you should be able to bring
yourself to say it.

I will never speak of it.

Just say it.
Tampon, tampon, tampon.

What's the big deal?

In Ukraine, there are
pop songs about it.

She's so pretty,
she's so grouchy.

That is inappropriate
counter display.

You take it down.

You take down
the price and I will.

No, it is free market.

I charge what I want.

I am the boss.

Max, someone left a stack of
newspapers filled with cue-pons,

and look, a double
for Duncan Hines.

Could this day get
any better?

Oh, and tables four, seven and
eight want their checks.

Okay.

Have 'em ready right here.

Max, no, that is private!

Here's your check.

And a little something extra,

compliments of women without
three quarters everywhere.

Thank you very much.

I don't know
about your flow,

so I gave you a regular
and a super.

Max, have you no shame?

Nope.

Ladies, at that
time of the month,

I invite
you to think of this man.

This man, Han Lee,
right over here.

The man who thinks your menses
should be more expenses.

Okay, okay,
I will lower the price

back to a quarter.

And that is end
of discussion, period.

Oh.

Tampons for everyone.

Max, you are the Norma Rae
of feminine hygiene.

It's so windy.

Choosing coupon shopping over
going to see your son again?

That's a keshame.

In the Lifetime
movie version,

this is where they take
you away as an unfit mother.

And I don't cry.

I'm sorry, but I just saw

that all these cake mix cue-pons
expire today.

I'll be real quick.

Ten minutes, in and out.

If I had a cue-pon
for every time

I heard that from a guy.

Here, start going
through these papers

and look for
the cake mix double cue-pon.

If I combine these
with the in-store bonus,

not only will we get
the lower cue-pon mix price,

but they will actually
give us $23 back!

I'll give you $24
to stop saying cue-pon.

Come on, start pulling out
the ones for the cake mix.

It'll be a breeze.

No, that was a breeze.

My cue-pons!

The fact that you're more
worried about your coupons

than your hair
shows how far you've fallen.

Oh, my God,
I can't believe it.

Max, it's the Williamsburg
cue-pon queen.

Where'd she leave her crown,
in the minivan?

This is so exciting.
I have to go pay my respects.

We don't have
time for this.

Just throw the cake mix
into the cart

or we'll miss the train.

There, calm down,
have a treat.

I'll be right back.

Excuse me, your highness,

but aren't you
the cue-pon queen?

Mm-hmm.

I'm Caroline.

Freddie, and I can't
talk right now

because if I lose my place--

- you'll lose your mind!
- I'm gonna lose... my... mind...

I know.
You say that on your show.

I won't bother you,
but I think you'll be excited

when I tell you that
it's only my second day

and I already learned

how to make money
on the purchase of cake mix.

All I have to do is buy 40 boxes
and we get the--

Store bonus, yeah.

Cake mix...
That's a rare cue-pon.

Where'd you find it?

Yesterday's circulars.

Didn't you see it?

I missed it.

Go to the truck and get the
stockpile of circulars.

Look at him go.

You're sweeping
the shelves.

On your show, you said sweeping
the shelves was out of line.

Max!

These are mine,
I was here first.

I think she's probably
gonna be here last,

so let's go,
we don't need these.

We do, if we
don't get 40 boxes,

they won't be free.

I've met actual queens and
this isn't royal behavior.

Max, she just body-checked me.

Push me again and I will report
you to the American embassy.

Max, get in here.

Oh, we got a problem?

Oh, we got a problem.

Oh, hell no!

What do we do?

You step away
and pretend you didn't do it.

That's what you do.

24, 25--

You're making me wait,
now aren't ya?

Just till I get to 40.

26, 27, 28.

Come on,
I'll buy it for you.

Come on, take up
the bitch on his offer

and let's go see Chestnut.

Max, shh, I'm counting.

If we don't have the exact
right mix-to-coupon ratio

we won't get our free money.

Okay, where was I?

Amateur.

Real mature, your highness.

We have places to go.

Okay, 40.

Take it away, Tanya.

Wait, what is this?

This isn't Duncan Hines,
it's Pillsbury.

Where did this come from?

I put it in.

You can't do that.

It has to be all Duncan Hines.

I needed Pillsbury.

Well, you can't have it.

- I need it!
- Why?

- I need it!
- Why?

That's the secret ingredient.

I throw a spoon of Pillsbury

in the Duncan Hines.

Pillsbury?

That's what makes it you?

That's what makes
it more delicious.

Tanya, stop,
flag on the play.

Here, take this back

and get me another.

You know what,
I'm just gonna go

see Chestnut while
I still have time.

No, Max, please take this back
and get me another one.

You're the one
who wanted to use

the store-bought mix instead
of making your own from scratch.

So go back and
get me another mix.

I used the mix because
I don't know how to make my own.

No one ever taught me.

No one taught me how to bake.

No one taught me
how to use tampons.

No one taught me anything.

You still think I should
send my mom a better gift?

And no one taught you
how to check out, either.

I'm going.

Max.

You need to get another mix,
now don't ya?

I'll go get it,
won't take a minute.

Who's the queen now?

Hey, my dude.

Look at you
and your fancy coat.

Retirement looks good on you.

Told you I'd come by
to see you.

Hooked you up
with some carrots.

Bugs Bunny status,
like I know you like.

I, uh, I don't know
if you got my text.

Probably not a great
signal in here, but...

your mom might
be a little late.

She's coming though 'cause I
know she's dying to see you.

All right, man,
who am I kidding?

She's not coming.

I know that's hard to hear,

and trust me,
mothers not showing up,

I've been there.

But, I know wherever she is,

she is
thinking of you.

Okay, that's not true either.

Here's the thing.

Your mom is a flake.

And you got two options,

you can sit around
feeling sorry for yourself

or you can say,
"hey, my mom's not here.

"I can watch tv all day
and then go kick in

a neighbor's window
because I feel like it."

Hey.

Hey, look at me.

The fact that she's
not here is not your fault.

It's hers.

There, I just saved you, like,

14 inappropriate
sexual encounters.

Hi.

Hey.

Hi, Chestnut!

Hi, baby.

Aw...

I missed you.

I missed you so much.

Did you miss me?

So you got
all the cake mix?

Yes, plus the $23.

And I got you your
Pillsbury as well.

Paid full price--
it killed me.

You are a freak
with the coupons.

I know.

I don't know
what came over me.

When I found a way
to make free money

I forgot about everyone else.

Oh, my God.

Like my father.

Max, I have Ponzi DNA.

Yeah, cou-Ponzi DNA.

Must have been hard learning
to do everything on your own.

I mean, I don't know how to
do any of that stuff either,

but, I had a staff of 20.

Yeah, I got staph at 20.

You know, you may think
your secret ingredient

is a spoonful of Pillsbury,

but it's not.

It's you.

It's everything
you've been through

that makes you who you are.

Someone who fights
for a box of tampons

and fights for
a horse's feelings

and even fights
for a box of cake mix

when a friend in the middle of a
cue-Ponzi panic, asks her to.

This is the part in the
lifetime movie version

where I get up to pee.

I don't know who
you're kidding.

You watch the entire movie
and then you cry.

Listen to her, Chestnut.

She thinks she has me
all figured out.

What she doesn't know is that
when it comes to the cupcakes,

I have another secret,
secret ingredient.

Oh, don't tell me it's
a pinch of Betty Crocker.

I can't tell you.
It's a secret ingredient.

Okay, it's chocolate
methamphetamine.

No, it's true.

Our slogan should be:

They're so good,

you'll rob your grandmother.

Max, I feel like this woman on Tinder

is lying about her age.

If she's 78, I'm 25.

I'd say she's 80, but that rack is 40.

Well, maybe I can squeeze her in tonight,

but I already got eight dates.

With my arthritis it's
impossible to swipe left.


Girls, you're going to
have to close up tonight.

I'm pretty sure I have a date with Earl.

Han, your only friend that
isn't imaginary is here.

He's dropping my VIP passes to Game Con.

Ned's demo-ing the brand new video game

he created, and I'll be there

hanging out in the cosplayer's lair.

Is that where you don't get laired?

Thank God I didn't tell you
it was sponsored by Virgin.

I don't get video games.

In my day, if you wanted
to enter another reality

you just took acid and
went to the aquarium.

Game Con has awesome swag bags.

This year they're handing out iPads,

and last year I got the Microsoft Surface.

You are a Microsoft surface.

Have fun at Lollapa-loser.

I would never go to Lame Con.

I've got to go to Game Con!

So we can make fun of Han some more?

Because video games really seem
to be my put-down sweet spot.

Caroline, it's about time you knew.

I'm really into video games.

I've known since I was ten.

Max, are you coming out
to me as a game woman?

There was this arcade

at the pizza place my
mom used to leave me at.

Ms. Pac-Man taught me
how to swallow pills.

All right, well, if
we're confessing things,

I really want a free iPad, so I guess

you'll have to be nice to that nerd,

even if he is a customer.

All right, we got this.

Suck it up.

I'm not sucking anything.

Hey, everybody!

Well, I guess it's true what they say.

You can't hire my manicurist

to put an addition on your apartment, yeah.

Oh, you're renovating.

That explains the banging
and power drills I hear.

Most of that was us.

We got some new sex toys.

It's like Santa's dirty workshop up there.

See, we're splitting the boudoir in half

so the baby can have its own bedroom.

Its own bedroom?

So the baby that you're
not even pregnant with yet

is doing better than old Caroline?

No, Ming Wa wants me to
give up my walk-in closet.

I mean, that's where my
purses and half my hair live.

So purses and hair

are doing better than old Caroline too?

Uh, earwax is doing
better than old Caroline.

Come on, Caroline.

Let's shake these asses
and get them passes.

Do you think I should shave my back

for tomorrow for Game Con?

My mom does.

Here are your fries.

Ned, have you been working out?

You know my name?

Max, take your hand away.

You'll kill him.

Is there any way you can get
me into Game Con tomorrow?

Oh! This is rich.

The hot girls need something from the nerds

like in science class
or any marriage in LA.

I don't have any more tickets...

or now a will to live.

So... this is awkward.

Well, puberty's a challenging time, Han.

I did it!

I got us in.

Max, again, I feel like
the homeless shelter

would be a step down for us.

To Game Con.

I got us jobs as booth babes!

I'd rather go to the shelter.

What are booth babes?

We just have to wear these dresses,

look hot, and hand out some flyers.

Like a sexy Jehovah's Witness.

Wearing that? Where's the top?

- That is the top.
- Okay, where's the bottom?

- You're looking at it.
- Where's the middle?

- That's it.
- And the rest?

Oh, right.

Slutty boots!

Are we really gonna show

our vaginas for a gift bag?

Yes, what else are they for?

You heard Han.

We could get a TV,
XBoxes, your precious iPad.

At the very least, bottled water.

It's just so degrading to
parade around in short skirts

and be fake nice to nerds and...

oh, my God, that's what we do at the diner.

Hey, girls.

We had to fire our contractor.

Yeah, it's just taking too long.

It's like having sex with a guy on Prozac.

Been there.

And I'm still waiting.

So we hired my cousin.

She and I have become close
since we stopped dating.

I mean, we were going to stay at a hotel,

but why do that when we
can stay with friends?

Friends? What friends?

Not you, Caroline. Max.

I can't believe what I'm wearing.

This dress sets women back
further than HBO's "Ballers."

Well, I think it's nice to be
paid to put on clothes for once.

"Ant Thrax"?

Oops.

You'll have to get it.

I can't bend over any further

or everyone will see my PlayStation.

Did a very slow earthquake
just hit this booth?

Hi. Is this, like, a real dance,

or should I go get help?

They're not having seizures.

I think we're supposed to dance like that.

Max? Caroline?

Even though you just saw us doing that,

we are still so much cooler than you.

Yes, but the gap's getting smaller.

How did you two get in here?

A continuing series of bad decisions.

You wouldn't help us,

so we decided to be booth babes.

The most recent in the continuing series

of those bad decisions.

Max, Caroline, I'd like
you to meet my gamer crew.

Basically, my Han-tourage.

You were right, this thing
was sponsored by Virgin.

If you guys are here,

who's watching your
grandmother's basements?

And this is my plus-on, Eunice.

AKA Super Nintend-Ho.

We never met till today.

Isn't he the cutest?

He saved me from a burning village,

and then he asked me to marry him.

Actually, my avatar asked

her avatar to get married...

in the game.

Congratulations.

That's not sad.

I'm gonna go get my Pixel Pie a drink.

It's the least I can do for the man

who pulled me from a roaring inferno.

Hurry back!

I should have let her burn!

Are you kidding?

She's your type:

willing.

But I can't be tied down.

Between this VIP pass

and my suite at the Holiday Inn Express,

I could be the Don Juan of Game Con.

She's coming!

Oh, where's Han Solo going?

Uh... the Pok�mon
booth started a flash mob

and they needed a Pikachu.

Death Bitch!

I knew you seemed familiar.

You look like that new
character, Death Bitch.

Your booth is right over there.

It's the most popular video game here...

after "Girlfriend Simulator."

Oh, my God, Max.

Look.

Han's gamer friend nerd
is carrying you away.

And I do not like where he has his hand.

Ned, stop!

Yeah.

At least buy me drink first.

I'm just gonna put this down.

Ned, this is your game?

You turned Max into
some kind of Boobarella.

I'm sorry, you weren't
supposed to see this yet.

I was going to invite you to
the official release party.

If this guy's having a release party,

it's probably into an old sock.

By the way, I'm taking this.

I need someone to cover my
shift at the diner tomorrow.

I don't think you'll
need to work at the diner

after you're compensated for
Ned stealing your likeness.

My mom said it was fine.

I can get money for this?

Because I'm pretty sure

"Grand Theft Auto" is based
on how I got to New York.

How you doing?

Tony Shapiro, Rock N' Roll Games.

Recently divorced.

Tony, I don't think you bargained for

a Wharton-educated booth babe...

and neither did I.

But your designer stole
my friend's likeness

without her consent,

so we're entitled to a
percentage of the profits.

This illustration is not so
similar that it would hold up

in a court of law.

Oh, my God, Death Bitch.

That's not her.

The hell it's not.

Look at her, dude.

One, two.

Look, it's clear you guys don't
have the money for a lawyer.

That's true. Keep talking.

But I get you want a payday,

so I will pay your friend to play Amorta

and take pictures with the fans
at our photo booth tomorrow.

You're in luck.

The model we hired died of an overdose.

At least she died doing what I love.

Tony, we may look like
we've settled in life,

but we aren't gonna settle here.

We stand to make millions
if we take you to court.

- No, you don't.
- That's true, keep talking.

What do you want?

Throw in a free iPad and I'll
deliver her on-time and clean.

You'll get me here on time.

Um... what's happening here?

Is this the foreplay or the cleanup?

Sophie's using a PedEgg on my feet.

And it tickles.

Yeah, you know, if you go just one day

without shaving calluses,

you've already lost the war.

Yeah, well, I'm sorry for the mess.

Uh, I had to bring down
some basic necessities.

Yeah, like... like plates
and cups and toilet paper.

Wait, is that a TV and
an XBox in my apartment?

I don't know what to do.

I've been waiting for
this day my whole life,

and now that it's hear I'm shy.

Yeah, this is how we watch TV.

We get Hulu, Netflix, YouTube...

YouSpank...

SpankBank...

PornOnTheCob.

Can I pop in this sweet
demo game I got today?

It's a hyper-sexualized,
violent version of me

who kills everyone who gets in my way.

It's a biopic, really.

Stick it in and I'll watch you play.

Gosh, if I had a nickel
every time Oleg said that...

You'd be able to afford a hotel room?

Okay, well, I'm gonna go in the other room,

anywhere but here...

which now smells like
patchouli and pierogis.

Oh, we have a sex swing now.

Welcome to Asrieth, Amorta.

You must kill anything that moves.

Go.

This chick is my spirit animal.

All she's doing is drinking from a flask

and punching people in the face.

Max, she's just like you.

Yak Girl, come!

I need you!

What's that silly animal thing?

Yak Girl.

I think she's my sidekick.

Hey.

That thing looks just like Caroline.

It does!

It looks like Caroline!

Why did I hear my name?

Why am I seeing a horse
thing that has my face?

Please, Caroline, it's not
a horse thing with your face.

It's a yak thing with your face.

That's the sound you make

when you have to do side work at the diner.

Yak Girl, come!

Hey, look.

Max, you're riding her.

Oh!

Oh, no, no way.

I'm calling that Tony jerk right now.

So what?

She just lets Death Bitch ride her?

That's all Yak Girl does?

No, she poops when you hit this button.

Ah, Caroline can't stop pooping!

Just like that one time at the diner.

Tony, this is Caroline Channing,

AKA Yak Girl.

I am taking you to court.

That's true. Keep talking.

That's your big offer?

That I dress like that and
take pictures with nerds?

Well, let me just say to you, sir,

I will need an iPad, as well.

Somebody better go out
and get that toilet paper.

How long till Death Bitch?

I have to go take my medication.

What are you taking? You got any extra?

Right this way.

This is so exciting.

This will be fun.

I haven't been paid to be a
bitch since I worked at the DMV.

Ooh, a green screen.

Look, I'm on another planet.

Finally got that vacation.

Hey, Yak Girl, come on out. Time is money!

You okay in there?

This is what it must be like for
Kim Kardashian to enter a room.

All right, it's pretty simple.

One picture.

And don't worry if you get a boner.

We'll crop it out.

Could I be any more humiliated?

I just want a photo with her.

Not you.

I guess you could.

Fine, I'm probably due for a poop, anyway.

Aah!

I'm okay!

Can you chop my head off?

It'll be the best head you'll ever get.

All right, get out of here. I killed you.

Hold on.

Death Bitch, say your catchphrase.

Remember: even in death,

you're my bitch.

I'm really liking this identity.

It's better than the other 17 I've had.

Nobody wants to take a photo with me.

I mean, baby got yak, right, Max?

Will you just let me enjoy this?

This is a dream come true for me.

I'm at a game convention.

I'm the star of a video game.

I can kill without consequences.

I'm pretty much peaking right now.

Yeah, well, I have hooves.

Can I just be upset for one minute?

Max, hide me.

Looks like you're doing a
pretty good job of that yourself.

Aah!

Seriously, help.

Get back here, Han Solo!

You promised we'd build our lives together.

We shared that Hot Pocket
"Lady in the Tramp" style.

Uh, miss?

There's gotta be better people out there.

Have you tried literally anyone else?

I convinced my sister to
sign me out for this weekend,

so you are not gonna stop
me from seeing my Han.

Back off, Amorta!

Uh, Han, you're on your own.

I can't ruin this costume.

I'm gonna need it the next time
I have to get out of jury duty.

Oh, no, I'm a goner.

She's gonna eat me alive.

You should have seen her go
to town on that Hot Pocket.

Out of the way, Han. I'll show you all

I can do more than just poop.

Oh.

Uh, Yak Girl?

Your heinie quarters are showing.

Got it.

This is gonna make the girl
I'm catfishing real jealous.

Hey, Earl.

Hey, Caroline. Hey, Max.

Hey, Max.

Hi, Max. Hey.

Look at that.

I have the exact same antlers.

That's not me.

You can tell by how fast she's moving.

Know what's not moving fast?

Our construction.

Yeah, we had to fire Oleg's cousin.

Turns out the sexual
tension was still there.

Hey body... not so much.

Yeah, so it's gonna take
at least another week.

A week?

There goes the "no sex while
Max and Caroline are awake" rule.

That wasn't sex you were
having in front of us?

Max, Caroline,

I don't know how I'll ever repay you

for getting Eunice off my back.

I do.

Sophie and Oleg are staying
at your place for a week.

I was thinking an extra baked
potato with your shift meal.

Yeah, Han, um...

how much bouncing can your bed take?

You're killing me, Max.

Yep, even in death,

you're my bitch.


Move over! I wanna sit here close to you
so we can take the picture for our new website.

Look, if you want to get all
lesbian with me, just go for it.

You don't have to pretend
it's for the website.

It is.

And for the record, in 2009,
when Katy Perry

"kissed a girl and liked it,"
I kissed one and didn't.

Ready?

One... two... and...

- Perfect.
- Perfect?

This photo does not say "let us
do your child's birthday party."

It says
"we're an AC/DC tribute band,

and you can pay us in cocaine."

Oleg,

will you take a picture
of us for our website?

You realize
you just asked a man

who only takes pictures
of his penis?

Yes.

But it's always well-lit,
and perfectly in focus.

You won't be disappointed.

I take lots of website pictures.

Yeah, but we're not wearing
just bras and chicken masks.

We have time.

Maybe we should rethink
the "coke whore" picture.

Well, good night, ladies.

Sleep tight,
don't let the bed bugs bite.

And I remember
a time in New York

when that was more
cute than accurate.

- Good night, Earl.
- Good night.

Earl, I have come across

a $6 inaccuracy
in tonight's total.

You must go over
all checks again.

Han, I'm just on my way home.

But it is not yet 2:00 A.M.

I hate to play the heavy,

but you must sit down
and go over checks again.

Han, I am 75 years old.

I don't even have enough
time left to wipe twice.

Well, well.

Hello there.

Oh, there are the girls.

Sophie, hello.

You look pretty.

Oh, I know.

Oh, sorry,
the kitchen's closed.

- What?
- Kitchen was closed...

But can now be open again

for such a beautiful woman.

Hello. I am the chef.

Oh, here we go.

Ukraine's going
to try to invade Poland.

It's double d-day.

Oleg, this is
our neighbor, Sophie.

I would like to have
a plate with sausage on it

while I look over the menu.

Yowza.

You are like someone super-sized
Victoria's secret angel.

I'd like to Gisele
on your Bundchens.

You're going
to act like a dog,

I'll treat you like a dog.

Well, there goes
his photography career.

Do you still want the sausage?

Yes, of course.
Why should sausage suffer?

You know
how to handle yourself.

- Impressive.
- Mm-hmm.

That was like a game
of "rock, paper, pervert."

Sophie, thank you
for coming in.

Max and I wanted to talk
to you about taking you up

on your offer to work
for your cleaning company.

Yeah, she wants to do it for
money to pay for our website,

and I want to do it

because I like rummaging through
strangers' medicine cabinets.

Have you cleaned
houses before?

Well, I had a house,
and it was very clean.

But whatever the task,
you won't be sorry.

Max and I are a great team,

and when we set our mind to
something, we accomplish it.

- And if you consider giving us...
- Oh, stop.

This is not
a dental school interview.

Come on,
this is scrubbing toilets.

In or out?

We're in.
All the way.

In my experience,
when someone has to tell you

they're all the way in,

you'd better hope
their tongue works.

So dirty.

We can start tomorrow.

Just tell us where to go,
and we'll be there.

Oh, okay.

Well, uh, you walk
out your door,

you take right,
you go upstairs,

you open my door,
and you clean my apartment.

Is audition.

Can't I just take off
my shirt like in fame?

Excuse me.

Here is your
non-sexual appetizer.

You and I will start small.

You like?

Yes.

Good boy. Now go.

Forced to clean
Sophie's apartment?

This is getting dicey.

Next thing you know,
we're locked in a crate

on our way to the far east.

Max, we're going to spend
this money on our website.

That's the future
of our company.

But the future
is so far in the future,

and I need this money
now for real stuff,

like gummi bears and eye liner.

How do you think
you get to the future?

Uh, Marty McFly
and a delorean?

Besides, we don't need
the website yet.

We got the birthday cupcake
job tomorrow without it.

And where do you think
we got that job?

I don't know, the job fairy?

What? I don't pay attention
to the business stuff.

I got the order
at the web design company

when I overheard someone say
it was his son's fifth birthday.

Gross. Using children
for your own profit.

Way to go, China.

Well, here we are.

Why is this big news?

Come in.

So, if this all works out today,

I have two possible
jobs for you.

Two? That's amazing.

This is the only way
that I can make sure

that you don't ruin
my company's good name.

'Cause I work hard
to build "Sophie's choice."

Now, uh, one
of you take bathroom

and one of you take out here.

Who does which?

Bathroom. I'm going
to go with bathroom.

I love a challenge.

If not perfect clean,
no job.

Begin.

Watch out, ladies.

I'm about to go ham
on this b-room.

What is this "ham"?

Hard as a mother.

Max, I love when you're dirty.

Oh. Very impressive.

You clean

like bull.

Roar of cleaning.

No big deal.

I was lifting up couches
when I was six

to help my mom look for change
and her boyfriend's tooth.

I'm almost finished in here!

This one like
to make big announcements

- about nothing, yes?
- Yes.

Hey, does that
electric cigarette work?

Yes, yeah.

I smoked for seven years,
and then I quit when I was 12.

Yeah, I didn't want to die
of lung cancer

before I was teenager.

Can I get a hit?

Oh, yeah, please, try.

I have many more in the drawers.

I smoked the summer I shucked
oysters on a gay cruise.

Ooh, glamorous.

Almost done.
Two-minute warning.

Be prepared to be amazed.

Max, you shouldn't smoke.
You'll get...

What, electrocuted?

This is silly.

If I'm going to suck
on something this hard

and get no pleasure out of it,
I should just date.

I think you're going
to be thrilled.

Oh, she stinks.

Spritz, spritz.
She is sprayer.

All mirror, no toilet.

Well, you know, she's sort of
new to this kind of work.

She was born rich,

but her father stole
a bunch of money from people,

and she was thrown out
of her townhouse and disgraced.

Yes, well,
she clean like rich girl.

"Hey, everybody, look,
look what I'm doing.

Oh, spritz, spritz."

Oh!

See, you not born rich,

and you... you're like "roar."

- Right?
- Well.

Cleaning's not her thing,
but she has other strengths.

Mm, I don't see them.

Mm.

Uh, so
do we not have the job?

No, I give you job,

because one bull
equal two girls.

But why you need her,
I don't know.

You can make much more money
on your own.

Yeah, well,
we're kind of a team.

Listen, Max.
Let me tell you something.

She is like rock,
tied to you, balloon.

See, she hold you down.

You cut her loose, and...

Yeah, well,
she's not weighing me down.

I had lover who was rock.

And I let him go, and...

I'm finished, and I have
to say, that bathroom?

Nailed it.

Don't push it.
She saw it.

She barely looked at it.
I saw you in the mirror.

Your eye never even looked down.

Yes, that's because
this eye doesn't go down.

See, I'm trying.

Yeah, I have blind spot
from accident as child.

When I was six years old,

while working in Polish
knock-off

of McDonalds in warsaw,

I fell on hot McStick.

How did you fall
on a hot stick?

Not a stick that is hot.
A hot McStick.

It's meat on a stick,
and it's very popular.

They only have it, like,
two times a year.

It's like Mcribs.

Sophie, I'm so sorry,
that's awful.

Yeah, but I bet that
McStick thing is delicious.

It is.

Well, that must
have been hard.

I admire your courage.

What are you,
counsellor from unicef?

You are acing this interview.

Pffft...

Do you know where we are?

This whole building is models.

Life is so funny.

When I lived in Manhattan,

I used to come to model parties
here all the time.

And now you clean up
their poop.

You're right.
Life is funny.

Here's the apartment
upstairs tomorrow.

- 10j. Here it is.
- How do I look?

Maybe he's the Abercrombie model
from the Christmas ad

in the white sleigh

with the open fleece jacket
and the eight-pack.

I don't think it's him.

Hi, I'm big bill.

Come on in, girlies.

How many packs did you say?

Oh, what a lovely... oh!

Oh, my God.

Look, Max, he's a figure skater.

Go ahead, take it all in.

How could you not?

It's okay, I'm a model.
I'm used to it.

Hey, I know you.
You're the big bill.

You're the guy from
the gag greeting cards.

Yep. I sold 2 million
of that particular card.

On the front it says,
"you're on,"

when you open it up...

- "Thin ice"!
- Right.

Oh, I've got to go
in my bedroom and change.

I'll be right back.

Wow, big bill!

No, big bye-bye.

We're not staying here.

If that's what's on the wall,

who knows what's on the floor.

Or trapped underneath it.

This is an uncomfortable
work environment.

You were going to be on
all fours scrubbing a toilet.

It was always going to be an
uncomfortable work environment.

Okay, if we're staying,
that's three times

the amount of man.
We should get double the money.

I'm calling Sophie right now

and telling her
we should get more.

Um, I would not suggest
you complain to Sophie.

It's not a good idea.

Why? Do you know
something I don't?

She thinks you don't
know how to clean,

that you spritz, spritz.

And what does she say
about your cleaning skills?

I'm a bull and I roar.

I knew she didn't like me.

She only has eye for you.

Who cares what she thinks.
Just clean better today.

You do the living room.
I'll do the bathroom.

No, I'll do the bathroom,
just to prove a point.

I mean, reprove it.

This is just like when

they made me take
the S.A.T.S again,

away from all the asian kids.

Oh! Oh, my God!

Why are you freaking out?

You've already seen him naked.

It's not him.

Have you seen the size
of this toilet?

That is a big-ass toilet.

Literally.

Max, I'm finished.

The floor is so clean
you could eat off it,

and I'm sure he will.

Come on in,
I want you to see it.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Go down, go down, stop.
Never mind!

Don't need you to see it.
Everything's okay.

How's it going out there?

Either your water just broke,
or you pee like a smurf.

My shoes.

No, you did not flush
a whole roll of paper towels.

No, you did not
just use that tone with me

when my good shoes are wet.

Shut off the valve.

The valve?

Oh, God,
what is wrong with you?

How can you not know where
a toilet valve is?

I was rich.

But you have to admit,
the mirror?

Nailed it.

Wake up, you lazy bitch!

- What?
- Fire!

I'm fired?
Why, because of the toilet?

Look at the oven,
the cupcakes.

I'm sorry.
I fell asleep.

I was just going to lay down
for five minutes.

I asked you to do
one thing

while I went out
to get more milk...

Take the cupcakes
out of the oven.

"Happy Birthday, kids.
From Max's homemade cupcakes.

"You can learn more about us
and our blackened cupcakes

on our expensive website."

I'm sorry, Max.

I just really needed a little
siesta after all that cleaning.

How are you so good at Spanish
and so bad at cleaning?

What is that smell?

I grabbed my purse and ran.

Caroline burned cupcakes.

Oh, so sad.

Look at all those burnt cakes.

What happened here?

Just a little mishap.

I was so tired from cleaning
that bathroom earlier,

that I laid my head down
for five minutes

- and ended up falling asleep.
- Aw...

Such a shame.

Oh, look Max.

These cupcakes,
they're hard as rocks.

All you have to do

is throw the rock away,
and whee!

I don't think Sophie likes me.

What are you talking about?
She loves you.

No. I don't think
she has a blind spot.

I think she has
a blonde spot... for me.

Well, I think we've
found the place

where red bulls come to die.

Man, why do I never get
invited to parties like this?

Look. Do you know
what that means?

Yeah, this building
has a real shirt shortage.

Oh, my God,
do you think

this might be the Abercrombie
model's apartment?

I doubt it's the Abercrombie
model's apartment.

Here's a note.

It's addressed
to "cleaning dood,"

"dude" spelled "d-o-o-d."

It definitely might be the
Abercrombie model's apartment.

"Wake me when you get here."
He wants us to wake him.

So, do you think
he sleeps in the nude?

Yeah, "nood", "n-o-o-d."

Come on, let's go look.

Oh, oh, oh, so what,
seeing this guy naked

is no longer an "uncomfortable
work environment"?

It's still uncomfortable,

but in that exciting
uncomfortable way.

I think it is him.

It's the guy who put
the "abs" in Abercrombie.

And he's naked.
The good naked.

Should we lift the sheet?

Why not? I already
lifted it in my mind.

Max, I got this.

You start cleaning up
the mess out there.

No, you start cleaning
the mess out there... I got this.

The bedroom's attached
to the bathroom,

and I always do the bathrooms,
and he's my ideal type.

And by "doing" the bathrooms
do you mean flooding them,

and by "ideal type,"
do you mean unconscious?

Shh! We can talk
about this out here.

You're going to wake him.

That's what we're
supposed to do.

But as usual,
you don't want to do the job.

What's wrong with you?
You're acting weird.

Well, why should I have
to do all the heavy lifting

while you just get to nap
and see free model penis?

All the heavy lifting?
Where'd you get that from?

No one.

Sophie.

I knew she didn't like me.

It's not that
she doesn't like you,

she just doesn't think you're...

What? Doing anything?

She thinks
I'm not pulling my weight?

She thinks I'm dead weight?

Not dead weight,
more like... a rock...

To my balloon.

What is that,
some kind of Polish haiku?

What does that even mean?

She thinks if I cut the rock
loose, I'll go... fuuuuu!

Wait, so you're siding with

a woman you met
a week ago over me?

I'm not siding with anyone.
I'm just saying...

I know what this is.
This is "pick on the rich girl."

It's a poverty smackdown.

I heard you two talking
while I was in her bathroom,

spritz spritzing.

You think you do everything?
Fine, do everything.

You can "balloon"
all over this place,

'cause the "rock" is leaving.

Who is it?

You're the rock!
I'm the balloon!

Without me lifting you out of
your negative rockness,

you wouldn't even have
a cupcake business.

I'm the reason we even
have cupcake jobs.

Oh, oh, you're the reason?

Who stayed up all last night
baking 24 more cupcakes

while you were sleeping?

You did. And who delivered
the cupcakes this morning

while you were sleeping?
I did. Me. The balloon.

I floated over there and got
paid for the job that I got us

from the website
that I'm trying to pay for.

And now, I'm going
to float down this hall

and wake the hot model up
'cause, contrary to what you

and your poverty gal-pal
might think,

I always do the job
I'm hired for.

Oh, no! I am going
to wake him up.

Free model penis is my reward
for doing everything

and being tied
to a rock like you.

Oh, see? I can't get away,
because you're the rock

and you're heavier
than my balloon.

Hey, stop!

This is cleaning job,

not gorgeous ladies
of wrestling.

Good thing I stopped by
to check on you.

- What is all this?
- You explain it.

I'm going
to go wake the hot model up.

He left a note.
Just doing my job.

As usual.

So, you think
I'm holding Max back?

What kind of question is this?

Yes.

Well, you're wrong.
We're a great team.

And, yes, there are some
things she's better at.

But there are other areas
where I excel.

Well, I don't see them.

That's probably
because of your eye.

Did you wake him up?

Uh, no.
I think he might be dead.

Oh, no, not the hot one!

Aw, he's my favorite.

This is all I need on yelp.

We should call 911.

No, I got it.

What are you going to do?

I'm going to give him
mouth-to-mouth.

I didn't know there was
so much tongue involved.

This is not working.

But, you know what?
I know he's still alive,

because his manhood
is knocking on my lady door.

He must have taken too many
of those pills on the table.

Pills? I got this.

Max, go get some
hydrogen peroxide.

- Sophie, step aside, now.
- Oh, all right.

You sure you know
what you're doing?

My friend Candace travelstead
od'd like three times

in college,
and I brought her back twice.

There you go.

Bring him up.

Max, you hold his head back,
open his mouth.

Back up.

I'm starting
to see your worth.

What? You're being
subway creepy.

I have to say,
when you were punching

that almost-dead guy
in the stomach,

that was a serious
balloon move.

The truth is,
we're both balloons.

Yeah, but mine is, like,
way cooler than yours.

It's like one of those silver
ones that never goes out of air.

They don't make those anymore.
They're toxic.

Exactly.

Max, you know you won't
let me come into the kitchen

and help you bake, right?

And you know that
I know that without you,

the job fairy
would never show up, right?

But if you ever need me
to help you bake, I could.

No, it's cool.

You do your thing,
I'll do mine.

Hey, get your phone.

We should capture this
near-death victory moment

as our website picture.

Totally.

On the count of three,
think..."We made $200."

One... two...

Hold up.

Sir, if you want to go home
with that hand,

get it off my ass.

Okay, three.

Max! Caroline!

Look, here comes Han
carrying an iPad Mini.

Or is it an iPad
carrying a mini Han?

Han has a mini iPad?

We can't even afford
a maxi pad.

I am so upset.
I'm stuck in a lie.

Well, it's better than the time
you got stuck in that backpack.

Seriously, you guys.
I'm in trouble.

I just opened this email, and
my mother is coming to visit.

You have a mother?

I thought you came to life after
a kid in a toy store made a wish.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ♪

Synced by Reef


Han, your mother's coming all
the way from Korea to see you.

- Isn't that great news?
- Is this the face of great news?

See, my mother thinks
I have a girlfriend.

My father still thinks
I wasn't in the car

when my friend hit
that grifter in the Hamptons.

She thinks I have a girlfriend
because I might have told her I did.

Did you or didn't you?

I-I might have.

And I might have sent
my mother pictures of someone

and told her that she was
the woman I'm dating.

Han, you might have
catfished your mom?

I might have.

Catfishing...
Right.

That's when you pick up
a woman in a bar,

and when you get her
in the light,

you realize
she has whiskers.

P.S....
Doesn't bother me.

No, catfishing is
when you pretend

to be someone you're not
on the Internet.

You know, like everyone
on the Internet.

All my mother wants is for me to be
happily married like my father and her.

All my mother wants is
a cure for hep-C.

Look, here she is.

"Korean beauty June Kim,
aka Sapphire"?

Han, you chose a prostitute?

She's not a prostitute.
She has a website.

Yeah, and I know a guy
with business cards

whose "job" it is
to relax your rectum.

It says she's an exotic dancer
at this gentlemen's club in Manhattan.

So just go there and hire the hooker
to pretend to be your girlfriend.

And there's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

I tried, but the bouncer told me
to wait in the alley

for my mother
like all the other children.

So I was hoping
you guys could go for me.

Han, we are not doing that.

Strip clubs, lies...
That's not my scene.

That's not your "scene"?

You have a scene?

What is your scene, Caroline?
I haven't seen your scene.

In fact, you haven't seen
your scene in two years.

Trust me,
this is your scene now.

Oh, I understand.

Just one question...

Did I or did I not let you have
the cupcake window rent-free?

Wow, Han.
That's a cheap shot.

Low, bitchy...
I respect that.

We'll go to the strip club,

but if it's nude, nude, nude,
I am leaving, leaving, leaving.

That's the first time Han's ever been able
to hold something over someone's head.

Sapphire will be right
with you, ladies.

Thank you, my good man.

Give me a 20 from Han. You gotta tip
at these places or they'll murder you.

Thanks, doll. You'se twos
can have a seat on that couch.

Oh, no.
No, thank you.

I'm not catching...

Not catching
"Sypha-gonna-titus" today.

Well, if a whore's bath
is appropriate anywhere, it's here.

Max, please be professional
when she comes in.

No sexual comments.

Considering she's used to
walking in on dudes

who have their junk in their hand
like a sad present,

I am sure I can manage
to not offend her.

I'm just saying that despite
where we are,

let's remember,
she's a business woman like us.

The chairman of the board
is here.

Hi, ladies.
You ready for a good time?

Been waitin' my whole life.

Hello.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

I'm Caroline Channing, and this
is my colleague, Max black.

Yo, how's this gonna work?
I don't do two at a time.

So who wants to watch,
who wants to ride?

Oh, right.

Neither of us
will be riding, per se.

Hold your roll, girl. We're spending
a lot of Han's money here.

If I want a ride,
I'm getting a ride.

- Um, is it June or Sapphire?
- You can call me Paul if you pay me.

June, we're not here for a dance
or any of the other things you do

that I don't judge you for
because I'm very open-minded.

I've been to Amsterdam.

I'm on camera so I gotta dance for
someone or my bosses will fire me.

And then it's back
to waiting tables.

Told myself I'd never sink
that low again.

Yeah, we say that every day
when we get dressed for work.

Okay, sit.
Let's do this.

It's fine. I think
I got all the stains.

It's official!
We've paid Han back.

Um, could you turn
the other lights on?

She's allergic
to the truth.

So, June, here's the thing.
We have this boss.

Yeah, girl, work that.

I'm being encouraging,
businesswoman to businesswoman.

Anyway, his name is Han Lee, and see,
his mother is coming to visit.

Oh, nice move there.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I wasn't encouraging. Just commenting.

Oh, peek-a-boo,
there's your head.

Anyway, he needs a girlfriend,

so he sent his mother pictures of you
and said you were his girlfriend.

I think it's her turn.

Oh, uh...
The gist is,

he's willing to pay you
to pretend to be his girlfriend.

And I'm willing to pay you to show me
how to do that with my hips.

Ooh, you would make
a great stripper.

I know, I just have
a fear of success thing.

Can we turn the music off?

'Cause I'm getting disoriented and,
in all honesty, a little turned on.

And I cannot be a latent bisexual with
everything else already on my plate.

How much?

Whatever your rate is for sex, but
you won't even have to have sex.

- At the most, just kissing.
- Kissing is $500.

I love you.

Okay. I can give him the
"Girlfriend Experience" package.

He has no girlfriend, no experience, and
no package, so that sounds perfect.

Here, Earl, when my mother comes in,
pretend you are reading this.

Ooh, the Bible.

You know, I remember
when this first came out.

Didn't think
it would be a hit.

Earl, we're talking about
our lord, Jesus Christ!

So, no sign of
mama-say-mama-sah-ma-mama-Han?

I don't know. I don't know
what she looks like.

She's here.

Ohm-ma!

Han!

I can't tell if she's a smaller him
or if he's a smaller her.

You must be Han's mother.

I'm Earl.

I was just reading the Bible,

'cause when am I not?

Mother, this is Caroline.

Hay-yo!

Caroline, I didn't know
you spoke Korean.

I took it as an elective
after I mastered Japanese.

I had a hunch Asia was gonna
take over the world.

And congratulations,
right on track.

Caroline, your Korean
is very good.

- And this is Max.
- Nice to meet you, Mrs. Lee.

What does that face mean
in Korean?

It means zip up your top.

Here, mother, sit.
You must be hungry.

I'll get you a menu.

That's weird.

These usually bring joy
to the people.

Han Lee,
where is your girlfriend?

You'll meet her
at dinner tomorrow.

She wanted to be here, but with church
and all her work in brain surgery,

she's very busy.

And I thought it
was unrealistic

when you had a girlfriend that
didn't need an air pump.

Han, what are you thinking?
How are you ever going to pull this off?

With the help
of my two best friends?

Oh, good.
Who are they?

Please, have June come to your
apartment and we can brief her.

Well, if it's with you,
it's gonna be brief.

Remember, you owe me.

No, Han. At that club,
I saw a pregnant wall.

So...

I think we're even.

If I'm here to meet June,
why am I blindfolded?

So you can never find your way
back to our apartment again.

But I have your address
on your work forms.

No, you don't.

Max, I think he can
take it off now.

It's been an hour, and
we spun him around three times.

Well, someone's been to
a flea market.

And it smells like pot
in here.

So I smoked up a little before work.
I got to. My boss is a real butt munch.

Okay,
our call girl is here.

Another sentence
I never thought I'd say.

I look like I've had
a call girl before, right?

Han, you don't look like
you've called a girl before.

I need to calm down.

Do you have
any chamomile tea?

No, because I'm not a divorced
woman on a balcony in the fall.

But I do have something
that will help you relax.

Ooh, you mean...

Yes, I'm gonna lull you to sleep
with a tiny, invisible whistle.

So, June, are you working your way
through graduate school or something?

No, I like getting paid
for sex.

I mean, what's a handy
every now and then

if it pays the mortgage on my park
view terrace apartment, right?

Life is so funny sometimes.

Just when you think you're
better than someone, you're not.

Here we are, all relaxed.

And that was wild, like
getting your hamster stoned.

Okay, June, this has all the details
that Han sent his mom about you.

You told your mom
I'm a Harvard-educated

Christian doctor and also
a renowned classical pianist?

Yes, we met at church
and are crazy in love,

but we're waiting
till marriage.

Oh, well,
the Virgin Experience is 1,000.

Will you take 800?

- Max!
- What?

I was unconscious when I lost mine.
And I want to see what it's like.

Oh, I hope that's pizza.

'Cause I could go to third base
on some crazy bread right now.

No!
It's Sophie.

I asked her to bring down
some crosses

for June to wear
when she meets your mom.

What? Sophie knows I hired
a prostitute to be my girlfriend?

No, I didn't tell her anything.

But this will be a good test to see
if you two pass as a couple.

Hey, what's Han doing
with that hooker?

Sophie, this is June.

We hired her to pretend to be Han's
girlfriend while his mom's in town.

Oh, wait, so his mom

is supposed
to believe that

their parts match up somehow

and that's
a fun thing for her?

Oh. L-O-L.

Oh, this is
one of those things

that you think
about later and you laugh.

Look, look,
Caroline, look.

I brought you your crosses.

Sophie,
do you have anything smaller?

It's a date,
not an exorcism.

Oh, well, you gotta say that.

All right,
I'll be right back.

You see, I'm thinking about it
later and I'm L-O-L'ing.

Well, I gotta go.
I got this.

But that's a lot of material.
You don't want to stay and cram it?

How much for that?

No, it's cool.
I can fake it.

- You're sure you can fake it?
- Can I fake it...?

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

She's sure.

I wonder why Han
and his girlfriend are late?

Maybe something came up
and she had to take care of it.

That's actually probably
exactly what happened.

I hope my hair looks all right.

I'm wearing it the other way.

- It looks pretty.
- Yes. Very pretty.

I am just so excited that my Han
finally found the perfect girlfriend.

Oh, you know, his June is
a brilliant brain surgeon.

Well, she certainly knows
a lot about head.

And she also goes to church
every Sunday.

Yep, that girl is always
on her knees.

And she is
a classical pianist.

She is making this
too easy.

Oh, there they are.

Han! Han!

And girlfriend of Han.

Mother, may I present June?

June, this is my mother,
Su-Min Lee.

Please, call me Su-Min Lee.

Which means,
"so mean" to me.

It's a pleasure to meet you.

I've heard such
a great deal about you.

Oh, and Han has told me
how you two met.

What a beautiful story.

Oh, yes. That was beautiful
when we met at...

Upstairs on the roof...

Church! We met in church.
Upstairs on the roof of church.

We wanted to be closer to God.
We are both so holy!

Is it hot in here?
Or is it just the situation?

Oh, look, the appetizers
Mrs. Lee is paying for are here.

Before we start
on the appetizers,

June, please pray.

- I don't know any prayers.
- No, no, I'll do it, mother.

But first please,
can I get a Moscow Mule?

Go, June.
Please, pray.

Oh, God.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God!

And amen!

Oh, okay. I-I don't know
that one.

Hey.
I am starving.

That's quality.

Such a good appetite.
You ate the whole thing.

Didn't even chew.

June, the piano is free. Oh, you must
play something for us.

No, she can't play.

- Yeah, but you told me that she was...
- I mean, now.

I mean, she can't play
the piano now.

Look, look, Mrs. Lee.
The Chrysler Building.

It has the word "Christ"
in it.

Hey, Han, you dropped
your knife.

You better calm down.
You're gonna blow it.

You can't afford to blow it.
You can't even afford to kiss it.

I'm getting tense all over again.
Help a brother out.

What, you think I just carry
that stuff around with me

in my purse
in an Altoids container

with a Lisa Frank
unicorn sticker on it?

Max, what is going to happen?

I've got a more pressing
question...

How does someone with a mouth
so small get a joint so wet?

When June cannot play the piano,
mother will discover my lie.

It will be a big, big
disappointment.

I am the star of my family.

So, if your family were
the Jacksons, you'd be Michael?

'Cause I see you more
as a Tito.

Actually, petite-o.

Han's mom is right behind me.
She saw you two come in here.

I tried to stop her, but she has
strength, and it is all core.

Han, hide.

I'm sweating through the price tag.
And I have to return this.

If I'm going down,
I'm going down high.

It's 500 for kissing.

You can't afford
to go down.

What is going on
between you and my Han?

You two have been
whispering all night.

- Poor June.
- Poor June...?

Poor June lives in
a doorman building.

Mrs. Lee, I think you might have
gotten the wrong impression of Max.

No, she is after my son
for his big successful diner.

Oh, you have another son?

I am on to you.

You are just a money-grubbing,

big-booby,
dirty nasty girl.

Well, I wish I could say
you were wrong.

Mother, stop!

You cannot talk
to Max like that.

She is a good girl,
and a friend, and...

Wha...?

Okay, yes, you caught me.
I smoke weed.

Yes, I'm living the fast life in
New York City just as you feared.

Wha…?

But I only toke up when I am
under a lot of pressure.

See, mother,

I don't have a girlfriend.

June is a prostitute
I paid to pretend,

so you would think we were
happy as you and father.

Give me that.

Wha…?

I too am under
a lot of pressure, son.

The truth is your father
and I are no longer together.

He had an affair
with another woman

who has big fake ones
like her.

Max's breasts are real,
Mrs. Lee.

Mm. God bless.

Mine are too,
in case you were wondering.

I wasn't.

Son,
are you disappointed in me?

Mother,
are you disappointed in me?

No, Han.

You are the star of
our family and my heart.

- I love you.
- Aw, me too.

Okay, that's enough.

And another problem
solved by weed.

Hey, Han's mom.
It's puff-puff-pass.

Am I super high or is that whore
playing the piano?

Synced by Reef


Max.
Do you have any gum?

My breath tastes
like someone else's breath.

You're asking me
if I have any gum?

That's like asking New Jersey
if it has any sluts.

Great. There were onions
in my street meat.

Listen to me.
"Onions in my street meat."

Last year, I was taking meetings
on wall street.

This year, I'm eating meat
from the street by a wall.

Let's see.
Phone, chapstick.

A pill! Could be birth control,
could be ecstasy.

Waiting for a day off
to find out.

Why wait?

If I start touching your hair
in an hour,

don't let me have sex
with anyone.

Max!

Max, what's this?

It's addressed
to Max's homemade cupcakes.

Really? I thought
that was just a thing

I wrote
the new pizza place info on.

It's a $200 check
from that office party we did.

Max's homemade cupcakes
in type!

No way, I've never been
typed out before!

I've been cash, I've sweaty 20s
pushed into my palm,

but I've never been typed!

We's all grown up!
We's legit!

Listen up, diner!
I just hit the big time.

No more serving up slop
to you lowlifes.

So everybody can suck it!
My waitress days are over.

Can I get some more coffee?

Sure.

Earl, what are you doing?

Employees are not allowed
to drink diner liquor.

Now, hold up, Han.
It's April 16th.

Do you know what day
tomorrow is?

Oh, of course.
Happy Martin Luther King day.

Enjoy a drink on me.

It's not
Martin Luther King day.

Black people are allowed

to be excited about
other days too, you know.

It's tax day.

And I always treat myself
to a Brandy when I do my taxes

because I need to be drunk
when I see that refund amount.

Chicken breast,
side of hot sauce.

Breast? Hot sauce?
Come on, it's right there.

Max, now that I have
big love for Sophie,

I no longer say inappropriate
sexual things to other women.

I save all my hot sauce
for her breasts.

Love has made you
a real old lady.

Here you go, Brandy man.
Enjoy.

Max, you got a stamp?

I wanna drop this off
in the mail on my way home.

I have one in my purse.
I'll just get it.

Max, he wants to file
this year.

He doesn't have time
for the search party

to go into your purse
and return.

Hey, it's a purse.
It's supposed to be messy.

No, it's supposed
to be a purse,

not a retirement home
for a pair of panties

stuck to old lifesavers.

I'm kinda off my meal now.

I have a stamp
right here, Earl.

There, see?
Order versus chaos.

Also known as OCD versus

"Oh, here's a CD
I forgot I had."

Would you prefer a flower,
flag, or a love stamp?

Ladies, I don't care which,
I just wanna get these taxes

in the mail
before the deadline.

- Earl, you do your own taxes?
- I surely do.

Proud to say I haven't
missed a year since 1950

when I had my first job
as Frank Sinatra's ball boy.

Ball boy?
Was he a good tennis player?

No, darling,
he didn't play tennis.

The job was washing his balls.

And that was good work
for those times.

Do you mind
if I look over your 1040

to see if I can increase
your return?

Do you, Wharton, do you.

Well, at first glance,
I see you short-changed yourself

on some deductions.

There's 500 right there.

Why don't you sign this now,
and I'll save you what I can

and then drop it in the mail
tomorrow?

Max, look at this.

Blonde ambition here
just saved me $500.

Really? That's pretty cool.

Oh! There's another 100.

- No way, that's awesome.
- Ding, ding, ding.

It's like I won the slots
without being surrounded

by those pissed off ladies
with emphysema.

How could you not know

there was a cupcake check
in your purse?

It just got mixed in.

And anyway, who still sends
important stuff

through the mail these days?

What are we, pioneers?

No, we're businesswomen,

and we need to keep track
of every penny.

Hey, should we frame it
and hang it on the wall?

That way when we're
two billionaire bitches

who hate each other's guts,

we can look at the check
and remember.

Max, I'll never hate your guts.

You don't know.

Business pressure,

you caught me sleeping
with your husband,

anger about your bad facelift.

Oh, honey, I will never
have a bad facelift.

I've been collecting names
of good doctors since I was 11,

and I was terrified
by my piano teacher

whose nose was suddenly here.

That's pretty cool of you
to do Earl's taxes for him.

I'm happy to.

After all, finance is my field
of expertise.

Yeah, pretty cool.
You know, all that stuff.

Helpful hints and whatnot.

Cripes! What more
do I have to do,

Rouge my boobs and stand in a
storefront window in Amsterdam?

Are you gonna help me
with my taxes or not?

Max, I don't know
if it's a good idea.

I've seen your purse.
I can only imagine your taxes.

Can you let go of the purse?
It's just a messy bag.

It's not like I lost your child
in the outback.

It's symptomatic.
Here, look at my purse.

You know what, never mind.

It's too late
for a purse smackdown.

But for the record,
even if you win now,

my purse will kick
your purse's ass.

Later, after it spent two weeks
learning your purse's schedule.

Organized, clean, perfect.
Look.

Just look at it.

Look at it, Max.
It won't bite.

Who are you,
my mother's third boyfriend?

And truthfully,
before I saw that check,

I wasn't even going to file.

But now that our business
is getting real,

maybe I should start getting
real about my finances.

I mean, when we are
two billionaire bitches,

I don't want the government
to swoop in

and Wesley snipe us
for back taxes.

Okay, great.
We'll do it tomorrow.

And I promise, no more
purse slams starting now.

Who is that?

CNN. They found a 34th Chilean
miner in your purse.

Okay, okay!
Starting now.

- Who is it?
- Kim Kardashian.

No.
I'm not Kim Kardashian.

No, I work for a living.

Hey, Sophie, you come down
for your cupcake nightcap?

Yeah, thank you, Max.

But tonight
I'm going to take two.

'Cause I'm getting
ready to date

and I wanna get back
to my fighting weight.

Sophie, what do you mean

you're getting ready
to date again?

Oh, well, there's
some really cute new guys

down at the Polish club.

And--oh, my gosh,
one in particular

is like a cross between
Vin Diesel and Viggo Mortensen.

Yeah, so rich and handsome

you almost don't notice
the wheelchair.

Hard to resist a man in
New York who's got his own ride.

I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.

Oh, then don't.

It's just what about
you and Oleg?

He thinks you two are a couple.

A couple?

No, this is crazy talk.

I mean, yes, we have had
some hot, dirty sex

in a few kitchens
and toilets, and...

On the floor of a sandwich
shop in the subway.

Plus twice we did it like dogs
on the hallway stairs

and on every smooth surface
in my apartment.

But I mean, come on.
I mean, that's it.

I'm a lady.

Sophie, I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

but for Oleg,
it's not just about sex.

He feels things for you.

I know for a fact
he's buying you a special gift.

Tell her, Max.

Well, he mentioned
something about a fur,

and tonight
when he was talking about you

he did use the word "love."

Love?

Come on, don't ruin
my cupcake buzz.

I mean, this man has no future.

Of course, he does have
a giant penis.

But no future.

I mean, I've worked hard
to get where I am.

I need a man who has a dream
and a drive.

And I can buy a big giant
penis online for $47.

Really?
Add to cart.

Well, then you have to tell him

you're not interested
in going any further.

Oh, all right, don't worry.
I will.

Yeah, I mean,
I need this man in my life

like I need breast implants.

Which is like...
Not at all, right?

Here's another W-2,
H&R blonde.

Thank you.

Max, you worked
at a Mexican restaurant

in long island city?

Oh, my God,
don't be so judgmental.

Mira, look!

I just found a receipt for shoe
insoles and double-stick tape.

Work expense.

Again, senorita,
not a write-off.

Like when you asked if you could
claim your pot dealer

as an entertainment expense.

So I was wrong.
We've all got our talents.

You're great
at doing paperwork,

and I'm great at baking

and finding places to have sex
at carnivals.

Just add that to the pile
I'm calling

"evidence
for your future audit."

Not there,
that's Earl's tax return.

Can I see a copy
of what you filed last year?

Ugh...I didn't file
last year.

Or the year before
or any year ever.

Wait, you've never paid
your taxes?

No, I've never filed my taxes.

I've paid taxes.
I see it on my check.

$8 to the state,
$15 in federal income,

$6.23 to Fica,
whoever that lucky bitch is.

Max, why didn't you tell me
the severity of this last night?

Um, maybe you haven't noticed,
but I have issues around money.

Every year,
I say I'm going to file,

and then I put it off
and put it off

until the day it's due,
like today,

and then I sit down
with a 1040 and my W-2s,

and right around
the fourth question,

I'm like, screw it!

I'm gonna watch old soul train
clips on YouTube before work.

And then I feel like a loser
until tax day is over.

And then I'm like,
who cares? I'm awesome.

I'll do them next year.

So what you're telling me

is your finances are as messy
as your purse.

Careful now!

Starting to get a little hot
up in here.

Fine, I don't care.

I just want you
to get your taxes done.

Now throw away
all of your useless garbage

into this trash can.

You know what, I'm just gonna
go to that pop-up tax place

near the diner.

And I'll throw my "useless
garbage" in the dumpster

on the way out.

Wait, you're gonna spend
like $100

to have someone do your taxes

when I'm sitting right here.

The amount of money
I'll spend down there

is nothing compared
to the amount of money

I'd have to spend on weed
to survive doing taxes with you.

- Good afternoon, girls.
- Hello.

I hope Sophie and I's
wild lovemaking

didn't keep you up all night.

We wanted to come down

and show you the gift
I just gave Sophie.

Yeah, look, girls.
Look at my gift.

It's got a leg.

Wow, I didn't think you two
were the couple type.

We are going into Manhattan

for fruit cocktail
and champagne.

- Want to join?
- Hell, yeah!

No, Max,
you're doing your taxes.

Oh. My mother says
I can't come out.

Have fun.

This means nothing!

I can't believe you're putting
your financial future

into the hands of a hipster
tax place

called "The Tax of Life."

You know
how the old proverb goes.

"You take the good,
you take the bad.

You take what's left, and there
you have the tax of life."

43! Number 43.

And remember,
if you need any help,

I'm acquainted
with your finances.

And I'm acquainted
with your attitude.

Don't say a word.

- I'm 43.
- 'Sup, 43?

I'm Kyle.
I'm your tax bro.

Hi, I'm Max and this is
my mute friend Caroline.

I already started
to fill out the 1040

and I have my W-2s
from this year.

Also some receipts.

Well, let's get started!

Do you have a health savings
account?

- Definitely not.
- Oh, well, we can fudge that.

- I'll put you down for 500.
- Sounds good.

Fudge that? Fudge?

I wasn't aware
there was fudging in finance.

Domestic production activities.

- Like condoms and stuff?
- I guess.

Talk about adjusted
gross income, am I right?

Am I right?

Kyle, put me down for 250.

250.

Should I just put the cheese
plate out for the IRS now?

What about residential
energy credits?

I bought some of those
curly light bulbs once.

Oh, that's another 150 easily.

Sorry, Max,
I can't stop myself.

Money, finances--
this is my thing.

If we were at a copper-plated
jewelry sale,

I'd let you take the wheel.

I can't sit back and watch you
risk our financial future.

You'll be dragging me into this
with you and your tax bro.

Excuse me, tax bro.

Oh, my God, you wanna claim
a residential energy credit?

You don't even have a 5695
up here.

Hey, your mute friend's
all over this.

You should let her
do your taxes.

She's way better.

No, that's cool, Kyle.
I'm not gonna do this.

One more year won't kill me.

I'll just
spend this money on pot.

That's an entertainment
expense, bee-tee-Dubbs.

Max, don't give up yet.
Let me help.

Look, it's already 9:00.
We ran out of time.

At least take a form
and file an extension.

The post office
is open till midnight.

Max, you know you wanna change
your finances.

It's a step.

You're right.
Good idea.

They have extension forms
at the post office.

We can pick one up
when I drop off Earl's return.

- What?
- It's not here.

It's not in my purse.

Last time I saw it,
it was on the coffee table

before you came in
with all your tax stuff.

It must still be there.

Uh, no, you made me throw
all that stuff out.

You threw out
a 75-year-old man's tax return?

You threw some papers out too.

This is so not like me.

The only thing I've ever lost
is my virginity.

What are we gonna do?

No, it's okay. Relax.
No big deal.

We just have to go home
and climb through the dumpster.

No, seriously,
what are we gonna do?

Ready?

No, seriously,
what are we gonna do?

Well, let's get to it.

My garbage
ain't gonna find itself.

Max, I can't.

If I go in there,
I will literally be white trash.

Look, you're the one
who had to butt in

and get all "Wharton" with Earl.

If you had left him alone,

it would be at the post office
safe and sound.

Fine.

But to be clear,
if we find a baby in there,

you're raising it on your own.

Hey, it's already off
to a better start than I had.

There's food everywhere.

Oh, hell, no!
It's Tuesday--trash pick up!

Better get in and out

or we'll be on a garbage barge
to coney island.

Come on,
I'll give you ten fingers.

My shoes.
My dignity.

My shoes.

My hands are touching
a dumpster.

All right,
on the count of three,

I'll push,
you hoist yourself up.

But really pull yourself up,
or you won't make it.

It's hell.
I'm looking into hell.

1...2...3!

Whaa!

I wanted to scream,
but it wouldn't come out.

Okay, well, good luck.
See ya.

- Max!
- I'm kidding!

I'm coming around the back.
I found a place to get a leg up.

Now?
You just saw that now?

Aah!

Why'd you scream?
You knew it was me.

That's the one
I couldn't get out before.

Oh, God, look at this mess.

It's like looking for
a dirty needle in a haystack,

which I've done.

Okay, start poking around.
Look for familiar garbage.

"Familiar garbage"?

I hate it in here.
I wanna die.

It's not that bad.

My mom and I once spent
five hours in a dumpster

looking for proof that her
boyfriend was cheating on her,

and all we found was
a scratch-off worth a $1.50

and a beach towel.

And then, we used that $1.50

to take the towel
to the laundromat.

12 years later,
you and I use that very towel

to dry ourselves off
after a shower.

Well, I'm standing on
a stranger's cold sesame noodles

with egg shells
stuck to my ankles.

You win, Max.

What does that have to do
with me?

It means I'm officially
standing in your purse.

How about more real garbage,
less Caroline garbage?

Caroline garbage?

You have been dumping
on me all day.

Me? What have I done?

"Max, you didn't file...ever?"

I didn't say it like that.

And you didn't file ever.
Is that my fault?

Yes! This is all your fault.

Before I met you, I didn't
even think about a future.

Now I have a future,
and I'm standing in a dumpster!

You are not the only one
standing in a dumpster.

And...get a new purse.

If you had been able
to find a stupid stamp

in that horrid thing,

I would've never even seen
Earl's taxes

and I wouldn't be standing
in a dumpster.

Max, no, no, no!

I will never, ever
recover from that!

Red bulls? Red bulls?
Are those our red bulls?

Where?

Yes! Yes!
That's my garbage!

That's my garbage!
Get over here!

If we find it,
we'll have enough time

to shower and get to
the post office.

Earl's taxes!
Earl's taxes!

Next!

This is unbelievable.

Everyone trying to get their
taxes filed by midnight.

Wow, I haven't seen this much
last-minute licking

since the cops raided
that Thai massage parlor.

- I'll grab an extension form.
- You get in line.

The line's longer
than I expected.

No, we have to file.
She's nursing.

Don't worry.
We're fine.

I'm a bum.

She's got a baby hanging off her
nipple and her taxes are done.

Max, you can't compare
yourself to other people.

You'll do it your way.

And there's a blind guy.

No eyes, taxes done.

I guess he wasn't distracted
by YouTube clips.

Don't be so hard on yourself.

You're filing an extension,
and then you'll get them done.

You say I'm going to file,
but will I?

I say I'm going to clean out
my purse, but do I?

Sophie says she's gonna
tell Oleg, but did she?

An extension
is just another excuse

for me to put it off
and create a bigger mess.

Hey, Max.
What's up?

Bob.
Wow, what are you doing here?

Oh, I just filed my taxes
like everyone else.

Bob had a good year.
Ha.

Who was that?

My dealer.
Forget the extension.

If my pot dealer can file,
I can file.

We still have half an hour.

Run home and get my W-2s

while I stay in line
and fill out the 1040.

Maybe I should stay
and fill it out,

and you can run home.

No, I have to do this.

Don't worry, if I get stumped,

I'm surrounded
by procrastinators.

One of them will help...
Eventually.

Okay, here's a pen.

I'm gonna go drop off
Earl's return in the slot,

and I'll be back
as soon as I can.

Okay.

Uh, hi, can you hold my place

while I get a tax form
for this year?

Oh, cutting it close.
You're worse than me.

- Go, I got your back.
- And she's got your front.

So I add up all these lines
and put the total here?

- Right.
- What about student loans?

Yes, and I paid mine off
this year.

Then claim it.

That interest
is a huge write off.

Put down $436 on line 33.

- Post office is closing!
- No!

My friend just texted me.
She's almost here.

Please,
I have to file this year.

Midnight is midnight!

Boo!

Oh, please,
I have six children at home.

This is nothing.

Here! I'm here, I'm here!
What time is it?

30 seconds.

Make room, make room.

Stapler, stapler.

- 10...
- Sign it! Sign your 1040!

- 9...
- Where?

8...7...

6...
Fold! Fold, you bastard!

5...4...

3...

2...

No stamp.

- What?
- Aw!

It's cool.
I got ya, boo.

I did it!
I filed my taxes!

Everybody can suck it!

(upbeat rock music)

Hey, Earl.

It's the brand-new us

in brand-new, gently-used
outfits.

The pit stains are vintage.

I dug mine out of a dumpster.

It wasn't even
touching the diaper.

I'm not used to seeing
you girls in clothes.

Things just sound creepier
when you're old.

As new part owners
of the diner,

we're making improvement.

Heh, not in the food or decor

'cause LOL.

But we're just
gonna look better.

Oleg, did you hear the news?

We're not wearing
uniforms anymore.

Cool.

Let's do it.

Just say the word.

The underwear is tear-away too.

Don't say words.

Oh, God!

I think I just looked into
the eye of the tiger.

Oh, it's my roach friend,
Pierre.

Bonjour, Pierre.

Au revoir, Pierre.

(both scream)

Stop, drop, and roll!

(both screaming)

MAX: You're on fire.

CAROLINE: You're on fire.

Now scissor a little.
It can't hurt.

(Peter Bjorn and John)
 * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

(cash register bell dings)

* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Okay, now that no one
can see Oleg's nipples,

let's start.

As you know, Max and I
are part owners of the diner.

You been telling us
every damn day

like a skinny cuckoo clock.

Which reminds me,

I timed my medication to it.

Pill me, Earl.

What was that?

I don't know.

Like to keep my body guessing.

So what's this meeting for?

The baby's almost here
and I still have a bunch of

new father stuff to do:

build a crib;

get rid of 60 yards
of butt-beads.

You can build a crib?

Anyway, the big change
we're talking about

is changing right now.

Han?

HAN: I don't want to!

Okay, fine.

(cheers and applause)

Those shorts look
like a cheap hotel,

no ballroom.

(laughter)

I already lost my diner.

Haven't I been shamed enough?

Ooh.
Thanks for reminding me.

Caroline?

Now you have.

And this is what you get
for gambling on ladies' tennis

and owing us $25,000.

You look like
Bob's "Little" Boy.

Should we order
directly into your mouth?

Han, since the diner
is now owner operated,

if we have to wait on tables,
so do you.

You're gonna cover our shifts
because our other business,

the dessert bar,
is opening in two days.

Did you say
you own a dessert bar?

Huh--pill time.

I don't know why I can't
catch a break from you two.

I had to put up with
Max's heartbreak

over her LA boyfriend Randy
for months.

It was more indulgent
than Beyoncé's "Lemonade."

(both gasp)

-How dare you?
-She's a queen.

The name "Randy" is off-limits
in this diner, Han.

Like ambition or fresh milk.

Girls, while you
have us trapped here,

what the hell
is a dessert bar?

Is it cake with alcohol in it?

Or alcohol with cake?

'Cause either way,
nobody wants to make love

after eating a big hunk of pie.

Earl, everybody
understands the concept.

I don't get the dessert bar
thing either.

Who wants to hear
from a human mustard packet?

Randy, Randy, Randy.
Zing!

(cheers and applause)

Damn, baby got back.

Thanks for the input, but
I think I know what I'm doing.

I went to Wharton.

Wharton.

That's my last pill.

Hey, every-baby!

(cheers and applause)

Yeah, it's my due date.

This baby is taking
longer to come out

than a Catholic from Indiana.

Sophie, do you feel anything?

I mean, besides
the vibrating panties I got you?

Oh, is that
what that sound is?

I thought a bee got in here.

Well, I'll be in my booth

waiting for my baby.

Welcome to the
Williamsburg Diner.

I'll be your waiter, Han.

Who's the new girl?

I don't like her.

*

None of these bartenders
have dessert bar experience.

I guess that's because
we made it up.

That one guy got drunk
at the M&M's store.

That's in the ballpark.

You just like him
'cause he gave you candy.

It did not hurt.

Hey.
I'm here for the bartender job.

Well, you're not
holding your penis,

so you're doing better
than the last guy.

Full disclosure: that guy's
still in the running.

Mine would be here, but
he gets nervous at interviews.

He's funny.

He's an actual bartender.

He's qualified, and he's
still not holding his penis.

You're hired.

Welcome aboard, Randall.

I hate that name.
People call me "Randy."

(scoffs)

And we hate that name.
Out you go.

No, no, no.
No, no, that's--come on.

He's not gonna bother me.

He looks nothing
like my Randy.

My Randy is a

mountain of a man.

But life got in the way.

He lives in LA and I was
starting this dessert bar.

Yeah, she's not over it.

Yeah, and you really pooped
the bed with the name thing.

He could pick me up
with one arm

and carry Chinese food
with the other.

(giggles)
Where'd that guy go?

He disappeared faster
than Adam Lambert.

Max, we need to avoid
any reminders of Randy.

I can't go back to that
depression you were in.

It was so hard for me.

Don't worry.

I'll be okay
and so will we.

This is Williamsburg;

you can't spit without
hitting a bartender.

Or an artisanal pickle maker.

Why do we live here?

I'm here for
the bartender interview.

(cheers and applause)

Oh, no, you two.

How do we know him?

(gasps)
Wait a minute.

Dad?

You're the puppet guy
that tried to sue us

two years and
three businesses ago

by saying we injured you.

She broke my puppet.

Wait, we never had sex.

Did we?

Do you wiggle a lot?

I do.

But we didn't.

Anyway, uh, since
I changed psychopharmacologists,

the puppets aren't
talking to me

as much.

Here's my résumé.

Please don't call
the references.

They're all jealous of me.

Under special skills,
you wrote, "Revenge."

Oh, whoops, that was
supposed to be under

"Favorite TV Shows."

But can't we just
let bygones be bygones?

I mean, really, I've done
a lot of work on myself.

I have found inner peace,

and I've completely--
completely centered myself

through a series of--
of therapy sessions

that became intensely sexual.

Yeah, I know.
It's on your résumé.

Him you can call.

We don't like to work with

nemesises.

Nemesi?

Let's just go with
"creepy people that we hate."

Fine.

You two, with
your porcelain skin

and your businesses.

I'll go back to
my crappy daytime job,

but FYI, Cagney and Lacey,

nobody knows what the hell
a dessert bar is.

What is so hard to understand?

It's signature cocktails

paired with
dessert confections.

(groans)

Why do all my enemies
have to be geniuses?

He does seem
a lot better.

Max, we open in two days;
we need a bartender.

Look, I will just
take care of the drinks

till we find the right person
not named "Randy."

Max, look around.
We did it.

And it only cost
every cent we got

from your big movie deal.

And the weed money
you were hiding

in that box labeled
"not weed money."

(giggles, gasps)

I'm gonna go check out
the bathroom again.

You know you've made it when
you have an industrial flush.

The seat is clean.
You don't even have to hover.

Come on!

Delivery for Max and Caroline.

What are you wearing?

And I don't know how
this is possible,

but you have a camel toe.

It's my flower delivery
uniform.

I picked up a shift so I could
pay you two shrews faster

and get my diner back.

Now, could you please sign?
I left my bicycle unlocked.

It says,
"Max and Caroline,

congratulations on
your dessert bar, Randy."

These are from Randy.

Oh, my God.
Get these out of here.

The Upsy Daisies are
our most popular item.

Widows get into fist fights
over them.

(toilet flushes)
MAX: Yes!

Han, get these out of here.

I can't her see these.
Go.

I will make a notation
that you did not tip.

No 19-digit promo code
for you.

* *

The mail wasn't there,
but that unexplained puddle

in the hallway is thriving.

I'm afraid they're gonna
call it a pool

and try to raise our rent.

Good!

I'd love to have friends over
to my puddle for a change.

Our liquor license
was supposed to come today.

We should have
gotten mail by now.

We also should have
left batteries

in the carbon monoxide
detector,

but I got tired
of all the beeping.

Do your eyes feel
bloodier than usual?

Hey, gals!

Yeah, nope.
Still not a mother.

Oh, I'm so bored.

I've Netflix'd, Hulu'd,
Amazoned.

I'm about to HBO GO
out of my mind.

Sophie, where did you get
those Upsy Daisies?

Oh, Han gave them to me.

Yeah, and he tried to sell me
a time-share in the Poconos.

Yeah, but I got to say,

I was a little intrigued.

Sophie, you shouldn't
be down here.

There's a probable
carbon monoxide leak.

You should go check out
our pool.

Why did Han give you flowers?

Is he trying to hit that?
(chuckles)

Oh, well, he'd have
to reach that first.

No, they were for you guys.

Yeah, Caroline didn't want them.

Yeah, but I'm not above
garbage flowers.

These are from Randy
for me.

You!

Max, I didn't want to tell you
about the flowers.

I didn't want to upset you.

If you don't want
to upset me,

then why do you
chew salad so loudly?

Uh, she's got a point there,
Caroline.

I am not mad.

You're not?

No.

It was really nice
of Randy to send flowers

and maybe I should call him.

Bad idea to get in touch
with Randy.

Very bad idea, like,

jumpsuits on short women.

What?

He did a nice thing

and I just want to thank him.

We'll thank him together.

You know what people
like to get nowadays?

A handwritten note.
Let me grab my stationery.

It's a Rite Aid receipt
so there's plenty of room.

-Dear Randy--
-You know what?

Just calling Randy is rude.

Since when do you
worry about rude?

-You interrupt almost every--
-I want to FaceTime him.

(phone beeping)

That's much worse, and you just
interrupted me ag--

-Hi, Randy.
-Max!

It's so great to hear from you.

Is Caroline not there,
or is she standing behind you

with her arms folded,
looking angry?

My arms aren't folded,
they're on my hips.

And I'm not angry,
but Max called you

without my permission.

Hi, Miss Channing.

Max has to get off the phone.

You're embarrassing me.

Max, it took you three months

and a palette of Cheetos
to get over him.

RANDY: You covered the screen,
not the speaker.

You shouldn't be
talking to him.

(scoffs)

You shouldn't be
wearing blue eye shadow.

(gasps)

You told me it looked nice

and now I've ruined the receipt
and I can't take it back.

RANDY:
Guys, I'm getting whiplash.

You know what?

Everyone just calm down.

I'm just saying thank you.

God-uh!

Sophie, is it time?

Are you in labor?

No.
(panting)

I broke my
masturbating underwear.

Ah, but you know how that goes.

I do not

and I will not act
like I might.

You know, you're a puzzle

that I have
no interest in solving.

Here's your mail.

(gasps)
The mail.

Our liquor license.

Yeah.

You know what,

I think my masturbating
underwear is short-circuiting,

but--eeh--oh--
but it feels pretty good.

Is not coming because I made
a tiny mistake on the forms?

Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

nobody knows
what a dessert bar is.

And frankly,

it just makes people angry.

Max, I have bad news.

Oh, my God--you're naked!

I'm saying thank you to Randy.

Looks like Randy
is thanking himself.

Oh, hey, sorry about that.

That thank you kind of
got away from us.

Max, put your pants on,
we're going downtown.

That's funny,
Randy just told me

to take them off
for the same reason.

* *

* *

Last time I saw
a line this long,

it went up my nose.

And I almost married
Katt Williams.

Excuse me?

Is there a different line
for people

who just made one tiny mistake
and it's not her fault

'cause she was just
overwhelmed at the time?

Max, we're gonna die here.

Ugh, finally.

I'd give out flyers for the
dessert bar, but I just saw

someone pull an unwrapped
cheese stick out of his pocket.

I can't believe you
filled out a form wrong.

Start a business much?

Uh, in my defense,
this is kind of your fault.

Me?
How is it my fault?

I was in a fort made
out of pillows most of July.

Or was it August?

I don't know, you can lose
track of time in a fort.

Exactly.

I had to jackass
around this whole city

to get the dessert bar ready
while you were

rolling in the deep,
getting over Randy.

So...

hello from the other side.

Girl fight.

Worldstar.

And now, after all that,

I catch you going down
on Randy's iPhone.

I'm warning you right now,

I am not bathing you again.

Look, there is a
mathematical formula

involved in break-up sex.

What do you know about math?

You always leave out six
when you count to ten.

Doesn't mean you're stupid.

A lot of persons do that.

Typically, in a break-up,

if you live in the same city,

you go to the guy's house
to pick up your stuff,

and then you do it.

That's one time.

Then you "forget something"
and he brings it to your place

and then you do it.

That's two.

Then you run into
each other at a bar,

do it in the bathroom.

Three.

Then you fake a pregnancy.
That's four.

Then he fakes an STD.
That's five.

And then
you're broken up.

There's been no math.

(scoffs)
Five is a number.

Numbers are math.
Read a book.

Yeah.
Read a book.

Name a book.

The phone book.

This line is for
municipal licenses only.

Not driver's licenses,
wedding licenses, or whatnot.

Municipal licenses.

If you don't know what that is,
you're in the wrong line.

How could you not know
what line

you're supposed to be
standing in?

(sighs)

Randy, let me call you
back from the bathroom.

I know where it is.
I used to work here.

Max!

Hey, Caroline.

Oh, Max was just thanking me
for the flowers again.

That's why I'm
not wearing a shirt.

Or pants.

Uh, let me call you back,
but keep your pants off.

(chuckles)

What?
I am not counting that as one.

Were you really gonna
spank it

in the middle of
the municipal building?

Spank it?

Don't be crass, Caroline.

Yes.

Next!

Ding ding ding!

It's just some clerical error

so we should be able
to get our license today.

Let me handle this.

You know you have a history of

getting slappy with bureaucrats.

Hi.

We got this in the mail,

and there's been some
teensy little mistake--

Well, well, well!

Him!

I've got this, Moesha.

Why don't you go clean up
your little

Lean Cuisine explosion
in the microwave?

Oh, she's a mess.

Now, how can I

not help you two?

This is your dead-end job?

I pictured you working
as a drug mule

or a seat filler on The View.

That's a job?

Dude, I just made a mistake
on the application.

Can't you just
give us a break?

Our dessert bar is supposed
to open tomorrow night.

Please?

I gave up a boyfriend
for this business,

and I'm gonna mess up

her pretty face
if it doesn't work out.

Max, thank you.

I was starting to think you
didn't think I was that pretty.

If we don't fix this, we're
gonna have to delay our opening.

So please?

You know what?

Let me talk to my supervisor.

(audience groans and laughs)

His neck's a little rusty,

but that's a no.

*

I would make us a drink
but without a liquor license,

all I can make is meth.

This is all my fault.

No, I was in a funk
about Randy

and you had to do
all this stuff on your own.

-It's my fault.
-Okay, good.

That's what I really thought,

but I just wanted to make sure
it was out there.

We have zero luck, Max,
zero.

I just stopped by to say

I'm sorry about
your dessert bar.

You two are unlucky A,F.

That's "As Freddie."

He's a friend of mine.

He's very unlucky.

Earl,

there's no outside liquor.

'Cause it just
makes us feel worse.

This ain't outside liquor.
It's from the diner.

Can't you tell by
the beef floating in it?

Oh, my God.
It's not from outside.

It's from the diner.

Max, who owns the diner?

Me, you, and
an Asian squirrel.

Max, we don't need
a liquor license because--

-We already have one.
-Uh-huh.

Oh!
I just did more math.

Still not math!

I haven't seen women
move that fast

since the Activia recall.

(gasps)

Here it is!

Oh, my God, Han's
middle name is Margaret.

Sometimes the universe
just gives you a gift.

(together) This entitles the
owner, operator, operators...

That's us!

(together)
Of the Williamsburg Diner

to serve alcohol
to those persons 21 and over,

reserving the right
to not serve those persons

who do not supply valid ID!

Max, do you know
what this means?

I am totally carding
Han Margaret

when he comes in
our dessert bar,

which is so opening
tomorrow night.

Hey, every-baby.

Still preg--
achoo!

(water breaks)

(both gasp)

Are you guys seeing this too?

I'm never gonna forget it.

I think my water broke.

Oleg!

Get out here and
bring the mop bucket.

Sophie's in labor.

Oh.
I'm calling the car right now.

It says "Your Lyft driver
is already here."

Did somebody order a car?

Look, it's Minnie Driver.

Sophie, we're having a baby.

I'm scared.

She should be scared,

she's wearing
electric underwear.

*

Slow, easy breaths.

I am!

I was more
talking to myself.

Don't leave me
in there alone.

You know I see dead people.

It's coming.

It's coming!

(groaning)

It's here!

The baby?

(horn honks)

Well, a baby.

Oh, good, our
goober driver's here.

Aren't I suffering enough

to get the diner back
from you two?

I'm already driving
for Lyft and Uber

and selling Molly out of
that glove compartment.

Shotgun!

* *

Han, I hate to hit
the stereotype

of Asian women drivers,

but could you speed the hell up?

Do you want to
arrive quickly

or do you want to
arrive safely?

A teddy bear doesn't count
as carpooling, lady!

I can't have a car baby.

Three of my brothers
were born in the car.

On the way to the woods,

where they were
supposed to be born.

Sophie, do you think you could
move your seat up a scooch?

Only because I think
my leg is broken.

This reminds me of
a road trip I took one time

with Earth, Wind & Fire.

The car was so cramped,

we had to leave Wind behind.

I feel like someone just left
some wind behind in here.

(honking)

Signal much?

Ow!

Sophie,

smile for the camera.

I don't want to miss a minute.

No Golishevsky man
has ever been there

for the birth of his child.

Why,
because it's bad luck

to see your wife
before she's born?

You tell one story where
your uncle marries his daughter,

and suddenly,
you're the incest guy.

Uh-oh.

It's happening.

Oh.

Ah, I can feel
the baby's head.

Oh.

(groans)

It's your sandwich.

It's yours now.

All right.

Sophie, you have to
make it to the hospital.

I sold my rare
toe-porn collection

to pay for a fancy
birthing suite.

I'm gonna give birth
to this baby in style.

I won't have to protect it
from wild animals afterwards,

you know, which is nice.

Sophie, don't get
too comfortable in that suite.

You're gonna need to
drop it like it's hot

the second we get
to the hospital.

Max and I have to get ready
for our dessert bar opening.

Baby on board!
Move it our lose it!

(honks)

In their defense,
it looks like

no one's driving this car.

* *

Excuse me, doctor?
It's been 12 hours.

Is there some way
we could speed this up?

You know, jumping jacks,
Indian food,

a C-section?

Does she need to be in here?

Yeah.

Yeah, that one

and the other one over there
are the godparents.

Max.

Yeah, girl.

They're not a couple.

Oleg thinks
they do it a little though.

Only 1 centimeter.
I don't feel anything.

It could be a while.

Sophie, you may want to
take off the Spanx.

I'm pregnant.

I'm not dead.

(groans)

Oh, man, tub legs.

I'll be back.

But not because I want to.

Oleg, come on,
film the room.

I want our baby to know
that I was treated like a queen.

You know, I think Elton John
had this room

when he gave birth.

I'm sorry, I lost y'all.

I feel asleep on a gurney
and woke up in the morgue.

I scared the pants off
a bunch of med students.

(iPhone chimes)

Ooh, there's my alarm.

I have to go have break-up
phone sex with my ex, Randy.

Like you do.

Well, don't go very far 'cause

Oleg gets fainty in hospitals

and supermarkets
that also sell clothing.

It's just too much.

Max, you and Randy have had
more sex since your break-up

then I had with
my college boyfriend.

Granted, he was very busy
with musical theater.

The only time we had sex was
when he was in his Cats' costume

and he asked me to give him
a Rum Tum Tugger.

The rule is

you have sex five times
before you're broken up.

And this is number five.

Historically,
the biggest, sweatiest,

and the most butt-centric--
his, not mine.

So--
(chuckles)

Do not disturb.

It's facing the wrong way,
and it's very disturbing.

Hey, Randy.

Oh, sorry, I just, uh,
just woke up.

Looks like you've
been up for awhile.

Mind if I camp
under that pup tent?

Can you go roast his
marshmallows somewhere else?

Excuse me, there's a VVVIP
patient coming in

who needs this room.

I don't care what kind of
disease they have.

I'm not going.

(Caroline gasps)

Oh, my God.

That's supermodel
Vanessa Nibotito.

(gasps)
She's pretty and smart.

It's hard, right girl?

I--I paid for this room.

That giant bag of quarters?
That's us!

Is my baby bump
seriously getting bumped

by a poor man's me?

I'm so sorry.

I could send you a copy of my
motherhood book if you'd like.

The lady I paid to write it
did a great job.

Oh, wait--wait a minute, no--
I'm not going anywhere.

No, wait a minute.

Wait, I'm not--
no, I'm not going.

You can't make me.
No, wait a minute.

Wait a min--
oh, wait, wait, wait.

Oh, look, I'm getting
a little arm workout here.

Oh, yeah.

* *

Sophie, the hospital is saying
they bounced us from the room

because we took too long.

They're offering us a cot
near the burn unit of the ICU.

Well,

ICU don't understand that
I'm not having this baby

until I get back in my suite.

That's a hard "no," Chris.

Guess who just flirted her way
into a free carpal tunnel glove?

Some girls flirt their way
into a sugar daddy;

I get medical supplies.

And more good news--

Did you get me my room back?

No, those days are over.

We're hallway people now.

But I was able to print out
flyers for our dessert bar.

I'd love to give them
a rounded edge.

Do you have scissors?

Are you kidding me?

Of course I do.
Look in my bag.

Sophie, they're offering us
a full-size bed,

but it's in an MRI machine.

I think we should take it.

Dessert bar opening tonight.

We have a ramp.

Excuse me, coming through.
Coming through.

A-lister about to give birth.

Oh, my God.

Celebrity doctor,
Nancy Gonzales!

You know, I wear your perfume.

Nancy, you might have heard,
dessert bar opening tonight.

Someone needs to control
the hallway people.

MAX: (giggles)
Randy.

Max!
(gasps)

That wasn't me,
it was naughty nurse Wanda.

I was about to
give Wanda a shot.

Well, she was gonna
give it to herself,

but I was gonna tell her
exactly how to do it.

Max, isn't playing doctor
in a hospital

a little on the nose?

I like to be on theme.

We can play
pirate and lusty wench

when I'm in
a Long John Silver's.

No, you won't because
we're not allowed in there

for that very reason.

Plus, didn't you already
have your fifth time?

You see, Caroline,
break-up sex in LA is six times.

It's the DeVito-Perlman rule.

Rhea forgot her yoga mat,
and five limoncellos later,

boom!

The rest is history.

He's a lawyer so
we have to listen to him.

* *

Dessert bar opening tonight.

Sophie, any progress
in your nethers?

'Cause our dessert bar
opens in five hours,

and it promises I'll be there
on the flyer.

Dessert bar opening tonight.
I'll be there.

Did you really have to
refer to yourself as

"New York's Own
Caroline Channing"?

She's coming.
Hallway people, clear a path.

Oh.

(cameras snapping)

Congratulations

because you're invited
to our dessert bar opening.

You can bring the baby
if you want,

but I wouldn't love it.

What's dessert?

I'm still tweeting
that she's coming.

I'm taking
the suite back, girls.

Roll me in!

Yeah, we're not
hallway people anymore.

Whoo-hoo!

Yeah!

(gasps)
Ooh.

How long can sushi
be sitting out?

Ooh, not that long.

What about this one?

Max, don't.

It promises on the flyer

that you'll be at the
dessert bar opening too.

It's in smaller letters,
but it's there.

Oh.
I got here as fast as I could.

To take the baby out?

No, to see the model.

Um, she's gone.

She kept saying,
"Where's Doctor Gomulka?"

Really?

No, no one's ever said that.

Well, since I'm already
disappointed,

I guess I'll take
a look under the hood.

Oleg, you know how
I love to have a snack

when I get my exam.

I'll go to the gift shop
and grab you some

chocolate-heavy trail mix
and some Hubba Bubba.

Oh, and Oleg!

Turn the bag upside down and--
oh.

(laughs)
He knows.

Well, if I were
a gambling man, I'd say

it'll be at least five hours.

Achoo!

(baby crying)

And that's how I lost my house.

Nurse, I need something
to cut the umbilical cord.

Oh, I--wait, wait.

You're in luck.

-Aww.
-(baby crying)

ALL: Aww.

Sophie,

you did great.

You're a mother.

Also, gesundheit.

Aw, the baby's beautiful.

Oh, my God.

I had the baby!

And Oleg missed it.

Oh, and he had his heart set
on seeing the baby being born.

And he missed it.

He's never gonna
forgive himself!

He's never, never, never, never,
never, never...

Please, Sophie, calm down.

Maybe Oleg didn't miss it.

It worries me how little
you know about science stuff.

We'll fake the birth.

You're asking me to help you
fake a birth?

You'll be fine.
You've faked an orgasm.

Well, that's true.

* *

We have to make Oleg
pass out long enough to bring

baby in and make him think
he just missed

a second of the actual birth.

Sophie, act like
you're in labor.

Just yell and tell Oleg
you wish you never met him.

It should be easy.

He's coming.
Places.

(panting)

Sorry it took so long,
but the lady in front of me

paid for her Jujubes
with a third-party check.

(groaning)
Oh, I'm in pain!

Oh, I'm about to have a baby

for the first time!

Okay.
I'm ready.

I popped a Pepto and
what I'm now realizing

was a laxative.

Oleg,

you stay out of the splash zone.

It's go time.

Oh, there is some seriously

birthy stuff
going on down here.

Oh, should we get a doctor?

Even a girl one?

There's no time!

Because of all the oozing gunk!

(groans)

Push, Sophie, push!

(straining)

You--you--you--

you did this to me

with your gorgeous penis!

We're both sorry!

Max, anything else disgusting
going on down there?

Oh, yeah, we got
a real sick situation here.

Oh, man, there's

a lot of placenta goo.

Oy, oy, oy, oy...

I haven't been this woozy
since I was in a Super Target.

I'm not going down.

-(groaning)
-I'm not going down.

The wet, sludgy baby
is fighting through the slime!

Oh.

Oh.

Oh, girls, quick.

He's down.
Get the baby!

Oh, my God.
All right.

All right, now,
to wake him up,

yell "immigration"
or tickle his--

Immigration!

What'd I miss?

Look, Oleg.

The baby is here.

And it's a girl.

She has a bejoonie,
just like her mama.

She's beautiful,
just like her mama.

Yeah.

Do you want to hold her?

Yeah?

Yeah.

Look.

That's your daddy.

Let her get settled
in the world

before you start
giving her bad news.

Hello, baby.

Barbara!

Barbara Kuchenski Golishevsky!

Oh, that sounds real musical,
doesn't it?

Depends what kind of music
you listen to.

Aww, she's so cute.

Barbara's a definite?

SOPHIE: Yeah.

I'm your godmother.

One day I'm gonna teach you
how to lie to these two.

And also this one.

* *

(gasps)
Look at all those people

at our door.

And not a torch in the mix.

CAROLINA: Oh, Earl.
Are you lost again?

The diner is next door!

Don't confuse him.
He's our bouncer.

You're our bouncer!

Now, you don't really expect
everybody on this list

to show up, now, do you?

'Cause Liam Hemsworth
and I are in a Twitter feud.

Okay, some of it
may have been wishful thinking,

but I did text 2 Chainz.

We met him
on a private plane once.

I gave him my digits.

Uh, 2 Chainz, is that
a person or a dress code?

It's both.

(audience cheers)

Earl, 2 Chainz
is a famous rapper.

Oh, my God,
2 Chainz is here--ah!

I'm letting 2 Chainz the famous
rapper in before we open.

What's up, Double C?

She prefers to be called,
"New York's Own Double C."

Sup?

I can't believe you
made it to our dessert bar.

I can't believe anybody
knows what a dessert bar is.

Are you kidding?

Sugar and alcohol
go hand in hand.

It's two great tastes
that taste great together.

Like how I seamlessly fuse
new-school and old-school flows.

Well, now I get it.

Why didn't you just
say that, girls?

Now, can I get
one of those flan-tinis, please?

Look, sorry I didn't
recognize you, 2 Chainz.

I let my subscription to Vibe
expire in 1984.

Oh, that's okay.

I think they give discounts
for return customers.

Oh, really?

Well, well, well!

Look who opened up a bar

after I denied them
a liquor license.

Well, well, well,
look who decided

to wear ladies' pants
hoping no one would notice.

J. Petto, what are you
doing here?

How did you know
we were opening?

I definitely didn't
give you a flyer.

I follow 2 Chainz on Twitter,

sometimes in my car.

Just so you know,
I have 911 on speed dial.

Our liquor license, sir.

Uh, this belongs to
the Williamsburg Diner.

They're the same property.
We own the diner.

They're related,

like Alec and whoever
the grossest Baldwin is.

Daniel.

You can't use another
establishment's liquor license.

I'm shutting you two down

and I'm slapping
the owner of the diner

with a $25,000 fine.

Who is this bitch?

Just some mean,
little man with

nothing better to do on a Friday
night than ruin our lives.

Not true;
I'm taking my aunt

to drag bingo
right after this.

Well, girls,

I managed to make it here
after this dog fornicated

his way across Greenpoint.

(chuckles)
Been there.

Done that.

Here's $300.

My earnings after
working 12 jobs

and being robbed 4 times.

Twice by the same girl.

You can have your diner back.

We feel bad about
taking it from you,

and also the
owner of the diner owes

old butt-chin here
and the city $25,000.

What?

The diner is mine again?

Yeah, sorry.

(gasps)

Yes!

Yes!
Yes!

I have my baby back.

You have baby everything.

I'm shutting you down
for 14 business days.

And you're getting
a bill in the mail

with very confusing
instructions.

And...

I'm having my birthday here.

Let's bounce, 2 Chainz.

So long, pal.

You're gonna have to find
someone else

to use as a chew toy.

Oh, man.

Sorry about the bar, girls.

I mean, guess I'm gonna
have to get me a bottle of rosé

and head over to
Mrs. Fields' again.

Does she have a sister?

Or a color TV?

See you later, girls.

It look like I'm gonna go party
with the old man right here.

(indistinct chatter)

Can you guys just
give us another minute?

Or 14 business days?

The only thing that
opened and closed faster than us

was Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot.

Well, at least I didn't get
a blow out for this.

That lessens the sting
of a failed opening.

Are you kidding?

I think this is gonna
make us more popular.

You know how people always want
what they can't have.

Like you with everything.

If that's true,
then why do you look upset?

'Cause Randy and I
are really broken up.

We burned through the
Affleck-Garner clause,

the Cox-Arquette addendum.

As soon as we got to
the Bieber-Gomez principle,

we were ashamed of ourselves.

Max, you're the queen
of not following the rules.

"Rules, schmules," you say.

Yes!

Rules, schmules!

And condoms, schmondoms.

Yeah, that one's not great.

What I'm saying is
you make stuff up.

Like this dessert bar.

And that was a great idea.

So you should make up
rules for you and Randy.

'Cause it really seems like
you guys care about each other.

Yeah, you're right.

Break-up, schmake-up.

Now, go call Randy

and make me want to
burn my iPad.

Go, I'm begging you.

Yeah, we're gonna kill it

in 14 business days.

* *

(cash register bell dings)

(upbeat rock music)

*

Hi, how can I help you?
And by that I mean,

"What's the least
I can do to help you."

I'll have the burger with the fries.

She'll have it with the salad.

But I want the fries.

Ah, you want them,
but you don't need them.

Fine. The salad.

I have to pee.

- Hi, what's your name?
- David.

David, you should go.

I'm sorry?

You want her to have salad,
she wants you to have hair.

Neither one's
gonna happen tonight.

Yeah, it's not gonna work out
between you and French fries.

Oh, maybe it will
for a week or a year.

Depends if she was molested
as a kid.

But one of these days,
she's coming after you.

Probably in the dark,
probably with a knife.

And she's gonna cut off
one or both of your balls.

And you won't think
a side of fries matters

when you have zero balls.

She'll have the fries.

Yes, she will.

Look at us.

We saved another woman's dignity
and another man's balls.

Yeah, we're like dr. Phil
but more qualified.

Season 3, Episode 4
"And the Group Head"




Well, here I am, the owner,
waiting on tables.

Does Barack Obama unclog
the White House toilets?

What's wrong
with this picture?

Well, off the top of my head,
I ordered a coffee ten minutes ago,

and you still
haven't gotten it.

Hey, man,
I'm in the weeds here.

Well, if you got weed,
cancel the coffee.

Uh, ladies,
you're late.

And little man Tate over there
is in a mood.

Why, is he teething again?

Uh, hello.

You were supposed to be here
ten minutes ago.

In Korea, your heads would be
on sticks outside the Samsung factory,

and you would still
have to work.

There is no coffee prepped
for your shift.

F.Y.I., tiny dancer,

prepping coffee is
that lazy-ass day waiter's job,

So don't blame us.

It's not our fault you hired
an incompetent wait staff.

Hurry up.
You two need to make coffee.

And you need to hire
a new day waiter.

And maybe while you're getting
new things around here,

how about
a brand-new coffeemaker?

One that isn't
from an Edward Hopper painting.

Am I the only one
who's been to a museum?

Uh, excuse me.

I've been to the art section
of Bed, Bath & Beyond.

What if I told you I already
got you what you want?

A high-end
cappuccino machine?

Listen, blonde ambition. I know
you only want me to get one,

so you can use it
at your cupcake window.

How dare you? Unless you're
comfortable with that.

No, I meant
the new day waiter.

He's in the kitchen.
Go train the new guy.

What happened to the guy
we told you to fire? We loved him.

Okay, we'll go
train the new guy now.

But about that coffeemaker,
what if go halfsies with you?

We can't afford
to go halfsies.

We can't even go quarter-sies or
eight-sies or whatever's after eight-sies

(Both)
Sixteenth-sies.

Shoot yourselves.

Did he say train
the new guy or new gay?

Hi, you must be
the new day waiter.

Ah, you must be the late girls
who are supposed to train me.

Yes, I'm Luis.

Did he say Luis
or Louise?

I'll be out in a minute. I have
to let this cream dry on my face.

Oh, I always wait for the cream to dry.
It's the polite thing to do.

I'm Max.

Oh, Max is funny.

(Luis) Look at her.

Oh, funny to mask the pain.

I see you.

Oh, and you're both pretty.

Look at blondie.

What have you had done?

Oh, me?

Nothing, but thank you.

I'm Caroline.

Well, nice to meet you,
but we won't be friends.

I don't get attached.

All my life, I've been
a waiter, 27 years.

I've been a waiter 27 years too,
and I'm only 26.

And I don't get personal,
so don't ask me how old I am.

I am 53.

But my face is 5.

You look amazing.

I've only been waiting tables
two years.

My main focus
is our cupcake business.

We just opened
a walk-up window...

Honey, honey, I don't need
to know your life.

You don't need
to know mine.

Did my father put a gun in his mouth
at my seventh birthday party?

Yes, but I don't
bring that to work.

And I'm in love
with you.

Don't do that.

Don't fall in love
with me.

You know those gays
that don't like women?

I'm one of them.

[Sex and the City theme
ringtone]

Is that the theme song
from Sex and the City?

You know it is.

I'm a Charlotte.
[laughs]

So am I!
There's not a lot of us.

I'm all the dead girls
from American Horror Story.

Well, let's get this train
on the tracks.

Follow me, Charlotte.

I'm not giving up
on our cappuccino machine.

I'm gonna work Han hard
until he gives it to me.

Yes, I just heard
how that sounded.

Okay, Luis, here's
how the tables work.

We got the four-tops.
We got the two-tops.

- Are you a top?
- Oh, please.

No one is pushing
this $25,000 face into a pillow.

I'm ready to order.

Luis, why don't you
take that table?

It's part of your training,
and I don't want to.

Earl,
that's the new day waiter.

He's also
the new gay waiter.

Oh, I love the gays.

They turned an old crack house
in my neighborhood into a cheese shop.

I heard that cheese shop
has really good crack.

What's the soup
of the day?

What does it say
on the board?

And you're trained.

Max, Han said no,

and we need that
cappuccino maker for our shop

if we're ever gonna compete with
the Starbucks around the corner

or the other corner,

or the other corner.

Or the one that's currently
being built in my ass.

What?
It's prime real estate.

Everything else
in Williamsburg is taken.

Caroline, you need a cappuccino machine?
I can get you one cheap. I know a guy.

And if you need clean urine or
a micro pig, I also know that guy.

Oh, my god.
Who was that?

Oh, that's... that's Oleg.
He's the cook.

He is gorgeous.

I'm so excited.

Our new machine
will be here any minute.

Our lives are about to get
a lot more cappuccino-y.

Or should I say a latte
more cappuccino-y?

No, you should not
say any of that.

And as for that "special price""
Oleg said he'd give us?

In all my three-ways, I'm up
to bat first, and I don't kiss.

Ugh.

During the day,
it is hot in herrr.

Thanks for
the weather report, Ursher.

[police siren blaring]

Here it is. Shut the windows
and shut up.

Well, this is starting
exactly like I imagined.

Shut it!

- Oleg, where did you get this?
- Shut up!

- Are those sirens?
- Shut up!

Does it come
with instructions?

The instructions
are to shut up.

We don't want it
if it's stolen.

I still feel guilty
about shaking down that redbox

for I don't know
how she does it.

I did not steal it.

I knowingly bought it
from a man who stole it,

and I'm selling it
at a profit.

It's the Armenian way.

You're not Armenian.

I know, I'm just saying,
it's the Armenian way.

It retails for $600,

but I'll give it to you for free
if you do me a favor.

Free?

Okay, I guess Max can do you
in that closet over there.

What?

Now that I see it,
I have to have it.

All right, I've been
saving this pill for something.

Talk to Sophie.

See if she wants
to get back together.

But don't tell her
I'm interested.

- Do it discreetly.
- Deal.

And, Oleg, I'm touched
and a little surprised.

I didn't know you knew
the word "discreetly".

Oh, yeah. I have a word-a-day
calendar near my bed,

next to my big pump jar
of pineapple lube.

For when you're horny
and hungry.

Max, why'd you take it?
You don't have to have sex with him.

I know, I'm celebrating.

Hey, I can't find any of the instructions
on here for our coffeemaker.

In fairness,
I haven't been looking.

I got sidetracked by this buzzfeed
list of misspelled tattoos.

This girl got "You go grill"
on her neck.

She must really like
to cook outside.

Did you put yourself
in a time-out?

No, I'm looking for Sophie.
She's not upstairs.

Look, this is a long way to go
to get something for free.

I was happy to walk into Sears and stuff
a cappuccino machine down my pants.

I'm not doing it
for the free cappuccino machine.

I'm doing it for the money we'll make
from the free cappuccino machine.

And maybe to help Oleg
and Sophie get back together.

You know, it's a page out of
Shakespeare, and I'm Puck.

Puck from The Real World?

Am I the only one
who's read a book?

[thud] [gasps]

Oh, here she is. I'll do the talking.
It's kind of in my wheelhouse.

You have a wheelhouse,
and we're living in this dump?

Morning, Sophie.

You caught me. I'm doing
the walk of shame.

You know what that means,
right?

I was having sex all night
with a stranger.

I had sex with a guy
all night once.

At least that's what he said.
I fell asleep at 10:00.

Sophie, come in. We wanted to ask
you something kind of important.

Oh, okay.

Well, I'll tell you.

I don't think you're gonna make it
in the cupcake business.

Not what the psychic in the subway
told me, but duly noted.

Actually, it's more
of a personal question.

Oh, okay.
Well, I personally

don't think you're gonna make it
in the cupcake business.

- No, the question is about Oleg.
- Oh, yeah, he agrees with me.

God's sakes, just tell her
before she tells us

we're gonna wind up in some disgusting
apartment, hiding from our pimp.

Okay, okay, Sophie.

Do you ever think about getting
back together with Oleg?

Oh, God, no.

I'd rather accidently have
sex again with my cousin.

I hate when that happens.

Why, did...

Did he ask about me?

Oh, no, no. I was just wondering.
He never even mentions you.

Oh, good.
'Cause I moved on, baby.

Oh, no. No, I...

I left my spanx
on that Staten Island stoop.

And they're the good ones,
you know, with the pee hole in them.

I gotta go grab 'em.

All right. Bye-bye.

Okay, good. Now we've got the power on,
but how do we steam the milk?

Maybe it's
on this touchpad thing.

[Spraying]
Holy Mother of God!

I just steamed my vagina.

Max, Caroline, your shift
started three minutes ago.

Who cares about sidework?
I probably can't have children.

What is wrong with her?

She just had her carpet
steam-cleaned.

You two still haven't
figured out this machine?

Move away. I'm asian and a man.
I'm good with this kind of stuff.

Well, Han, actually,
it's pretty dangerous.

Hey, Han's a man,
according to recent lore.

Let him save the day.

Okay, let's see.
Here's the steam one.

And here's the button for...
Ow!

My neck!
It burned my neck!

And that was
my best feature.

Luckily you're not taller.
You would've burned your vagina.

That cappuccino machine might have
just given me a grande hysterectomy.

Caroline, I know
this might not be a good time.

I heard
about your recent clambake.

But what did Sophie say?

I'm sorry, Oleg. Sophie's moved on.
She's seeing other men.

Yeah, but not in your neighborhood.
She's classy.

She had the decency to do it
on a stoop in Staten Island.

She went to the Island
without me?

We were going to travel
the world together.

Oleg...

Oleg, are you crying?

No, I have
a booger situation.

Says the man
who cooks the food.

Hey, what's this area
back there?

- Uh, it's our closet, why?
- I should check it out.

I'm always looking for places to have
sex with women who are not Sophie.

[crying]

Is Oleg in here?
I thought I smelled him.

That delicious mix
of man and butter.

Oleg's in the closet.

Oh, honey,
I could've told you that.

Really, Luis,
Oleg is straight.

Wait till you see what happens when
I place an order for a bone-in rib eye.

It's true.
He shows us his penis every...

Ah-ah-ah-ah, boundaries,
girls, boundaries.

So is it a nice one?

Well, it did open a door
for me once.

Hey, Luis,
maybe you can help us.

Since you're a lifer, you have
to know how to work this thing.

No, no, no, no, no, no,
I work for a diner.

I don't work for you.
Don't bring me into your drama.

[Sex and the City theme ringtone]

Oh, I have to get this. It's my mother.
She's on death watch.

But we used to have the same machine
when I worked at Starbucks.

Mami, como esta
su Lou Gehrig's?

No, I am not
working at Starbucks.

That's not what
I was gonna say.

Just for two hours.

We can quit after we learn
how to work this damn machine.

Hey, I am not a quitter.

I get fired.
That's my wheelhouse.

I can't believe
we got hired so quickly.

And I can't believe
I'm a medium apron.

And I can't believe I'm working
for a corporate coffee place.

This might be the lowest point
of my life,

and my mom once lost me
in a craps game behind a casino.

Hi, we're here
to be trained.

I know.
That's unfortunate.

- My name's Devon.
- Well, that's unfortunate.

Let's get this over with.

I have a lot of other places
I need to be.

Like your mom's basement?

Hey, you don't have
to give me attitude.

I don't have to,
but it's my pleasure.

Sorry, Devon. It's just that it's hard
for her, 'cause your name is Devon.

So what are you girls?
Writers?

Folk duo?
Just bitches?

Nailed it, loser.

Max, pace yourself. We need this job
for another hour and 50 minutes.

Okay, but for real,
how long do you

gotta work here before
the health insurance kicks in?

And is there dental? 'cause I got
a dead tooth doing nothing for me.

The insurance kicks in
after 30 days.

But it's a PPO,
not an HMO.

Oh, we just got an HMO at our other job.
He's a Charlotte.

Okay, here we go.

Look, this is the machine
we use for everything.

It's incredibly easy to work
unless you're stupid,

in which case, tell me now.

Devon, we're not your mean stepdad.
Just show us how to use the machine.

Listen up.

Unlatch the portafilter
from the group head.

Press here for an ounce of grounds.

Tamp it in, pack it down,
turn it on.

I didn't get that,
did you?

Honestly, all I heard
was "group head".

So you tamp, pack,
turn the knob,

wait 3, blast for 30,
then you pour the shot.

Place the steam wand
halfway in the pitcher

at a 45-degree angle
until the milk is 103 degrees.

So what you're saying is
it's easier to make meth?

Syrups, powders,
whipped cream is right here.

You ever work
with one of these?

I think I can handle it.
I went to Wharton.

- Well, I went to Harvard.
- And I went to juvie.

And we're all here
wearing an apron.

A grande double cap,
non-fat.

Grande double cap,
non-fat.

Meow, meow, meow,
meow, meow.

A venti triple cap,
no whip.

Venti triple cap,
no whip.

Meow, meow, shmeow, meow.

Grande double soy latte.

Grande double soy latte.
Got it, Max?

Nope.

- Where's those drinks, Max?
- Working on it, getting close.

And I finished
all over myself.

That's so me.

Come on, Max,
it can't be that hard.

You two, switch.
I gotta put out more napkins.

That women's breakup support group
is here, and they tap us out.

Think they're crying now?
Just wait till we run out of cake pops.

I'll have a tall cap,
triple-shot half caf.

Small scrap nipple slap
half half.

That's not what I said.

Tall cap triple-shot
half caf?

Girl, you're good at this.
You should work at Starbucks.

I am good. I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

Now I just have to...

Holy Mother of...
Ouch!

This thing hates women so much,
we should call it Texas.

Or Ohio.

Or, to be honest,
most of America.

I'll have a tall drip,
extra hot.

- Uh, what's your name?
- Gregg, with three "g"'s.

Yeah, you're gonna be
this picture of a penis.

- That's rude.
- Now it has a hat on it.

It's saying, "good day."

Do you want me to talk
to your manager?

Yeah, in about 20 minutes,
after she learns this machine.

Hi.

I'll take a non-fat
venti drip for Vera

and a tall latte for Fran

and a gingerbread latte
with 11 splendas.

Can you two explain
what this is?

- I'd say it's pretty obvious.
- That's a penis wearing a hat.

Why?

Because it's bald
and a little insecure.

- Dudes, you're, like, fired.
- Come on, Devon.

We just need 20 more minutes
to learn that machine.

Please?
No.

Return your aprons
and caps.

And do not even think about putting
sandwiches in your pockets.

What?

A girl can't
get a morning bun?

No and no.

And take this "crappuccino"
you made with you.

Oh, yeah,
that is not quite right.

And it hit my dead tooth.

- How you doing with that milk?
- Great.

Mine's more whipped
than Nick Cannon.

Hola, chicas. How's it going
with your new machine?

Not that I care
or am invested at all.

Oh, I think mine's coming.
I think mine's coming.

You don't even know
if you're coming or not?

[chuckles]
That's so you.

Have you seen Oleg?

No, not since he came out
of the closet.

- Why are you looking for him?
- How is this your business?

Because you said,
"Have you seen Oleg?"

You got me. Look at you.

So much spice,
so much pain.

You got me.

Hey, everybody.

Hola, Oleg,
and Oleg's sister?

This is Sasha.

We met last night
and a few times this morning.

- But do me a favor.
- Don't tell Sophie about this?

No, do tell her.
I've moved on.

I filled
that hole she left.

Come on, let's get you back to your
uncle's house before he wakes up.

Oh, it happens
to a lot of gays.

They come out, they freak out,
they go back in.

But I see him.

And I'll be here
until he sees me.

[Sex and the City theme ringtone]

Hola, mami.

Uh-oh. Charlotte's
headed for a fall.

I did it.
I made a perfect cappuccino.

75% of my body is burned,
but I did it.

So how is it?

We are so putting the small scrap
nipple slap half half on the menu.
